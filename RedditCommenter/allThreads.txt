Cliffhanger after cliffhanger, like the producers are hoping the studios will green light season 2 if everyone is asking \"oh my god who's the father?!?\"\n\nWhen a show ends a season *without* a cliffhanger, it feels like we've been given real closure. It would have been so *easy* for Bernard to have asked Ford, \"what happened to Elsie and Stubbs?\" Or, \"what about the other parks?\" Or, \"Are *you* a host of yourself?\" so that *we* would feel like something was missing, but they didn't tease us with it. They gave us an honest-to-God ending with actual resolution of conflicts.\n\nIt doesn't *matter* if Charlotte survived. It doesn't *matter* if William survived, or if Logan and the horse are rowing Gendry's boat somewhere. And it doesn't matter one bit of Maeve finds her daughter, Elsie and Stubbs are alive, or Bernard becomes the new Park Director. \n\nThese things are so trivial compared to the scope of the conflict that just got resolved: Dolores has a *bicameral mind.* We just witnessed Creation: not in seven days, but in thirty years. \n\nSo I think it's worth it to thank the showrunners for not dangling a stupid cliffhanger in front of us.

Norman grabs his headphones, and finds that song he loves, the one she showed him. It reminds him of her presence.\n\nHe listens over, and over again. In his mind he's embracing her.\n\nNorman drifts back into sleep." }

He was very excited about having found a Dean Koontz novel that he had not yet read.  It was a chilly evening, and the bulb had burnt out above the stop.\n\n\nA man came up and stood beside him at the bus stop with his hood up.  Norman did not think anything of this, and idly thumbed through the novel in front of him.  He was careful not to crease the pages.  “Library books are not yours, Norman,” his mother had always said. “They belong to everybody.”\n\n\nThe man beside him turned towards him, so Norman looked over and offered a smile.  “Your wallet,” said the man.\n\n\nNorman was perplexed, and asked him what he meant.\n\n\n“Your wallet!” The stranger repeated himself. “Give me your wallet, old man!\n\n\nNorman understood and nodded.  With trembling hands he took his wallet out of his hip pocket.  The man in the hood grabbed it and ran off into the night.  Norman’s heart pounded and his head began to spin.  He hardly even noticed the bus pulling up.\n\n\nWhen the driver asked if he was okay, he nodded and paid his fare from the change in his pocket.  As he sat down and the bus pulled away, Norman noticed he had dropped the novel without even realising it and had left it at the stop.\n\nHe resolved to call the library first thing in the morning to apologise." }

{ "subreddit" : "lifeofnorman", "title" : "The Book of Norman- The Time Has(almost) Finally Come/The Writers Who Made the Final Cut", "text" : "(If you're interested in hearing some of the progress on the book over the last number of months, feel free to read this overly long speech. If you're here to see who made the cut, and why others did not, skip to the last two paragraphs.)\n\nHello all! After a long, long while, I'm here with another update. Unfortunately I stated that there was a final update, and that no other update would come after it, which somewhat made me a recluse when it came to sharing information. Most of my info let out was through people specifically asking me, \"What the hell are you doing with the book, Cameron!?\", and I realize that isn't fair that I made you all have to reach out to me to find out that info. Anyways, I have some news.\n\nThe book is finished. Finito. Completo. Donno. Sort of. The innards, all the stories, and all the edits, which there were many, are complete. Frankly, I've had enough stories included in the book since February; that being 365. However, things change. The tone of the book has shifted a lot since the conception of the project, and because of that, stories I collected at the beginning no longer lined up with the thought process I had near the end.\n\nSo more stories were collected. Newer, fresher, more in line with what I had in mind. Then, the book shifts again, and I realize there's only so many stories you can have of Norman missing the bus and getting caught in the rain. So I scrapped some repetition.\n\nSo more stories were collected. Now, people are starting to write plotlines on the subreddit! Lisa is born! Frank's a drunk! Norman gets some confidence! Ideas that were non-existent start to pop up. \"I wish I thought of that earlier\" turns into \"Damn, I can't *not* put this in the book.\" So more stories are cut, and more are added. Variety. Levels of skill in writers advance. Some people just disappear and I can't make edits to their story, forcing me to cut. \n\nSo more stories were collected. Now, it's just the best of the crop. Months after finishing, I'll find some damn good stories, better than anything already included. More is cut. More is added. More is cut, yadda yadda.\n\nThen I realized, this will never stop. So long as the subreddit exists, there will be more stories, better stories, than anything written thus far. It evolves. No matter how many rounds of edits I do, re-reading the exact same story two dozen times, there will undoubtedly be typos. I hope not, I did my best, but there will always be grammatical slips, like finding grains of sand in your shoe years later. \n\nSo now, the book is done. It's reached a point where I can be proud of what its become, something that I hope you'll all enjoy. The thing that let's me know it's good, is when I re-read a story, one I've read dozens of times, and known the punchline for a year, but still manage to crack a smile, or even feel a punch in the gut from. It's littered with remarkable talent, fun stories, cute illustrations, and the fine line of boring yet undeniably charming that Norman always had.\n\nThis is not the end, and I realize I should stop praising the final product before it even exists. Hell, the whole point of this post here was for one purpose- to show which writers made the cut. I feel that I should post it well ahead of time, since, as this post has hopefully made clear, I had to cut a lot of stories. I felt bad about it. After a while, I had to move the names of the writers away from the stories and number them instead, since some people were so sincere and heartfelt with me, that I just felt horrible removing their stories after I told them it'd be included. If you didn't make the list, know that I am sorry, that it was nothing personal, and it wasn't always because it was better or worse than what made the book. There was a bigger picture involved. Sometimes a fantastic story delves too far from the books set canon, and creates inconsistency with a dozen other stories. Sometimes there will be a story similar to three other stories, but only one of them hits the notes needed for that part of the book. Sometimes, people don't respond to me, and I didn't feel comfortable publishing an altered story. Things get cut.\n\nBut it was all for the best; to make this book to be in the best shape it can be, without strings attached. And so, without further ado, here's the list. To those of you included, you'll be receiving a PM shortly. Basically, I'll give you one last chance to see what your story is, if you're interested, and make sure that if I made any changes that you're not fine with, that you can have this last chance to pull out or work it out with me. \n\n- /u/samuel2097\n- /u/renanFerrari\n- /u/Marine2014\n- /u/Xezer\n- /u/BatmanHimself\n\n- /u/RamsesThePigeon\n- /u/RUBY_FELL\n- /u/alien6\n- /u/Case_A\n-

Well, even though the book is finished, all the needed assets are not. I'm still waiting on artists and artwork, so forgive me. I'm very much hoping to have all the pieces finished in the next few weeks. Then, I'm going to order a review copy of the book, and if all is well, I'll publish it! Then, it'll be available for order through Amazon. \n\nI think a few weeks after that, I'll try and get the e-book version out there as well. One thing at a time. \n\nAs for people asking about pre-orders, know that there won't be anything. I'm a believer that pre-orders are just an excuse for money to be made before people find out whether or not a thing is good. So, buy it once it's out, or even after the early adopters tell you if it's worth the money. It's all still going to charity though, so hopefully you won't feel too out of pocket if you're disappointed with the result, but then again, that's no excuse.\n\nSo, let's just see where it goes, okay?" }

{ "subreddit" : "lifeofnorman", "title" : "Norman rebels.", "text" : "It was 9:16 a.m. and Norman was sitting on a lightly padded chair in the office kitchen at work. His manager was giving a presentation. As the stream of words drifted through the room, Norman began to notice that he felt rather tired. Odd, since he’d gotten his usual eight hours of sleep, and had drunk the same warm cup of coffee with cream that he always drank. A friendly bank teller had persuaded him yesterday to have a piece of hard candy, and he wondered sleepily if that could be the root of his lethargy. He’d read somewhere that too much sugar can affect sleep quality.\n\nAfter a short time, Norman noticed that he was having trouble focusing on his manager’s presentation, having missed the last few sentences. What’s more, Norman felt a yawn coming on. Now, Norman is not usually one to draw attention to himself, especially in such a professional atmosphere. He started to become worried – what if his manager thought that Norman was not engaged with the presentation? Norman did not want to consider the ramifications of such a thought, and though he feared making a scene, the urge to yawn was creeping slowly but steadily through his body.\n\nThen a strange and new thought occurred to Norman. He realized that he really WASN’T engaged in the presentation. He WAS rather bored by his manager today. Perhaps, Norman thought, I AM willing to shake things up a little, and give a good yawn. Nothing big, nothing flashy, just a nice, satisfying yawn.\n\nAs Norman considered it, he liked the idea more and more. He sat up and prepared himself for his act of rebellion. By this time, however, he found that he was much too excited, and the urge to yawn had left him entirely.\n\nNo more candy for me, Norman thought.

Norman, ehem, this is Lisa, from work...\"\n\nNorman's heart raced, was there some sort of work emergency that only he was capable of resolving? He wasn't sure he could handle the pressure. \n\n\"I, uh... I saw something weird the other day on lunch break,\" Lisa confessed.\n\nNorman relaxed slightly, but still, his mind raced as to what could possibly have been so important as to reach out to him on the weekend. \"Oh, what's that?\" He inquired.\n\n\"Look, I'll just send you a link, I still have your personal email.\" \n\nNorman thought for a moment, but then recalled that they had exchanged emails when they both were among those chosen at the office to arrange the holiday party; Norman was still proud of the rousing and bawdy event he had a hand in creating. There was still a punch stain on the floor by Johnson's desk!\n\n\"Just, please, give it a look. I'm sorry, I have to go\" Lisa said with increasing cadence, before hanging up abruptly.\n\nNorman assumed she must have had something important to tend to on her end, perhaps laundry. But he now had task in mind, and walked to the spare room where his reliable Dell sat, fans humming, the soft glow of it's indicator lights making the room feel less like a home office and more like a discotheque. He booted it up and got to work.\nHis home screen popped up; it was still unfamiliar to him, his son had installed something he called a \"browser\" last time he was over, even though Norman told him he was fine with just the \"internet.\" He kind of missed clicking on the familiar blue \"e\". \n\nNorman typed \"google\" into the google search bar, and clicked \"search.\" He still hadn't worked up the bravado to attempt \"i'm feeling lucky.\"\n\nThe google page loaded dutifully, and Norman promptly typed AOL as his query, clicking the \"search\" button, careful to avoid the \"lucky\" button, once again.\n\nHe carefully observed the links, and found the AOL link his son had advised him about, something about the top most links being ads. He hoped he had clicked the right one.\n\n\"You've got mail!\" the computer chimed.\n\n\"Success!\" Norman thought to himself.\n\nHe combed through his new emails, there were seven. He started by clicking the oldest one, he didn't want to be rude to whoever sent it, and make them wait.\n\n\"Cheap RX Canadian warehouse pharma megadeals,\" Norman read, he opened the email and began to read. It was typical medical jargon he was sure was beyond his paygrade, but on the off chance they might have something cheap to take care of Norman's hairballs, he clicked the embedded link. The computer thought and thought, but nothing came up. Suddenly he remembered his curiosity had him on a mission - he eyed the remaining emails until he saw Lisa's username. The subject line simply said \"lifeofnorman.\"\n\nNorman opened the email. It contained only a single link, \"www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman.\"\nHis curiosity was fully in control now, and he hovered his cursor over the link, when a shrill dinging came over the speakers. \n\n\"Ding ding ding; Threat has been detected!\"\n\nNorman panicked, as he broke into a cold sweat. Was someone trying to hack him? He quickly and instinctively deleted Lisa's email, and exited the browser. For good measure, he turned off his computer and unplugged it as well. \n\nHe'd have to check on those discount prescriptions another time." }

It was a bit smooshed as Norman had to hide it in his coat to protect it as it started to rain on his walk home last night. Eating it reminded him of how little he cared for mint chocolate, but he was committed to enjoying this rare sweet.\n  \n“Happy Birthday!” Allison shouted as Norman returned to his desk, startling him. She was carrying a tray of vanilla cupcakes. “You’d thought I'd forgotten, didn't you Jim?” She said as she placed the tray down on Jim's desk. “Come on everyone, get a cupcake and wish Jim a happy birthday!” Allison announced to the office. Jim looked pleased.\n  \nNorman was glad that Allison had remembered Jim’s birthday, and the cupcakes did look good to Norman. *Better not*, he thought, as he sat back down to his paperwork. *I've had enough.*\n" }

Craig.  Norman was not sure about Craig.  He always seemed so...*satisfied* with himself.  Norman wondered what always being satisfied with one's self felt like.  A couple of the women in the office certainly liked Craig.  Craig, with his crisp, curly hair, and his fast walk, and his hearty, cheerful, deep voice.  Norman sank back further into the shadowy closet, listening, waiting for his co-workers to return to their cubicles.  Craig launched into his joke. It was one of those long ones with much build up.  His co-workers were snorting bits of laughter even before it was finished.  The punch line came.  Much laughter, snickering, guffawing, giggling ensued.    Norman did not get the joke.  \"ah, that was great!\" said one. \"Hey! Make sure you tell Norman!  He could use a good laugh!\" said Julie.  Norman was fond of Julie.  She never treated him as if he was a non-entity.  \"Aw, I don't know...does Norman even understand jokes? He doesn't seem the joking kind\", said Craig.  \"Just tell him.\" said Julie.\n\nAfter they left, Norman hurried back to his desk, unnoticed.  In a bit, Craig approached.  While he was regaling Norman with the joke Norman worked at making a smile play around his lips, and burst into a laugh at the end.  \"Oh!  That is Funny!\" grinned Norman.  \"I can hardly wait until tonight, when I can tell this to my best friend!\"   \"You have a best friend??\" inquired Craig, somewhat amazed.  \"Oh, yeah, he lives in my neighborhood\", Norman replied.  \"I've known him almost his whole life.\" Craig went away and Norman wondered why others thought the joke was so funny.  \"I don't get it\" sighed Norman to himself.\n\n That evening after Norman was home from work and his Hungry Man dinner was cooking in the oven, Norman told Norman about the joke.  He scratched Norman's silky ears and rubbed his soft cheek with his knuckle.  Norman told the joke, trying hard to give the same inflections that Craig had.  At the end Norman blinked his large green cat eyes at Norman, and tilted his head, pondering.  He did not get the joke, either.  \n\n" }

Today, he was looking for a bottle of water.\n\nNorman opened the first refrigerator he came across, and found not a bottle of water in sight. He pushed a few bottles of Fanta and Powerade around, and yet the cooler seemed to be fresh out of water.\n\nSomewhat inconvenienced, as he had a dentist's appointment in just under an hour, and the water was the only item he planned on purchasing that day, he made his way to the next register line and peered inside that fridge. \n\nYet again, there was no water to be found. Instead of wasting semi-precious time peering deeper into the depths of the cooler, Norman let out a heavy sigh and walked over to the next register's fridge. Luckily, the store was not crowded at all, so he was not disturbing the huge line that may be typical at any other time of day. \n\nThis fridge, belonging to register seven, was not only out of water, but also Fanta and Coke as well. Norman found this mildly amusing, knowing that someone else, albeit looking for an entirely different product, might have also suffered the same inconvenience that he had. \n\nIt was on the fourth refrigerator he tried that Norman declared victory. With a sigh of relief, he reached into the back of the cooler and pulled out a bottle of water. As the condensation began to form on the bottle as it came into contact with the warmer air of the department store, Norman made his way to the nearest open checkout lane, as the one in which he found the water was closed.\n\nIt was behind the elderly lady with far too many items that Norman decided to forsake his one-item rule for the day and buy a 14-pack of anti-cavity gum with the hopes to impress his dentist in about half an hour's time. \n\nNorman payed for the two items with a five-dollar bill, and donated the remaining $1.49 to the charity box sitting on the register.

Weiner and his estranged wife, Huma Abedin, a top aide to Mrs. Clinton, federal law enforcement officials said Friday.\n\n&gt; The F.B.I. is investigating illicit text messages that Mr. Weiner, a former Democratic congressman from New York, sent to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. The bureau told Congress on Friday that it had uncovered new emails related to the Clinton case — one federal official said they numbered in the tens of thousands — potentially reigniting an issue that has weighed on the presidential campaign and offering a lifeline to Donald J. Trump less than two weeks before the election.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to an incredibly contentious election, how should federal and state agencies such as the FBI, handle the release of new information that may impact the election?\n\nShould these agencies adhere to their standard operating procedures regardless of their political climate? Should they add nuance to their releases to thwart potential distortion by media reporting? Should these agencies ever delay the release of important information?\n\nThis story also raises questions about the politicization of Congressional Committees. Can and should federal agencies push back against what they view to be unduly partisan requests from committees? Or does the importance of Congressional Oversight mean that agencies ought to always fulfill requests for information from Congress promptly?\n\nThe FBI is the latest example of government agencies acting and releasing information in the context of the election, but it is not the first. At the [beginning of the month](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/04/us/politics/trump-foundation-money.html), the Democratic State Attorney General in New York issued a cease and desist to the Trump Foundation and required that all financial documents be turned over within 15 days.

He breaks it down into 5 primary problems:\n\n1. **Geographic sorting**: partly through gerrymandering but much more through our own decisions to live near people with similar political leanings as us, we have created a situation where very few Congressional seats are competitive and Presidential elections are decided by increasingly fewer voters.\n\n2. **Straight-ticket voting**: increasingly less people are voting for candidates in different parties and simply voting straight-ticket.  This makes races even less competitive and leads to most races being little more than a census of party members in an area.  \n\n3. **Primaries have become the new general elections**: because so few seats are competitive, the real races for most seats are in the primaries which have particularly low turnout dominated mostly by the most partisan voters, leading to representatives that are even more partisan.\n\n4. **Congress grinds to a halt**: because of number three, representatives are increasingly unwilling to collaborate and/or compromise for fear of being primaried.  They feel they have to maintain ideological purity in their votes and rhetoric.  This leads to Congress having difficulty accomplishing anything.\n\n5. **Anger at politicians grows**: all of the above leads to anger and disillusionment from the electorate who grow increasingly frustrated with Washington and the political system.  This leads to the rise of candidates who stoke these fears and campaign against these establishment systems like Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders.\n\nI know many of these concepts aren't exactly new ideas, but I found this piece compelling for two main reasons.  First, as FiveThirtyEight is known for, he cited a lot of data to back up these claims.  Second, I think the organization of these five points in this order is excellent.  Starting at the beginning, each problem leads to the next problem.\n\n* What do you think about these arguments?\n\n* Is this a growing problem that will continue to make things worse?\n\n* Are there other root causes besides increased partisanship and geographic sorting that you can think of?\n\n* How can we address this issue if you think it needs addressed in any way?\n\n* If they aren't addressed, what do you think the next step in symptoms is beyond anger at politicians?\n\n* Is this ultimately a threat to our system of government as we know it?" }

{ "subreddit" : "westworld", "title" : "[Episode 8 Spoilers] We now know what \"truth\" the Wyatt narrative is rested in.", "text" : "When Ford originally creates the Wyatt storyline (specifically in the scene where he gives Teddy the Wyatt backstory), Ford mentions that the narrative is rested in truth. We saw this episode that the massacre that Teddy remembers as Wyatt having committed was actually committed by Dolores. This leads to several conclusions, all of which support the tinfoils across this thread.\n\n1) There are 3 timelines (Present, 30 years ago, 35 years ago)\nI think it's fairly obvious at this point that we have had three timelines displayed to us. The first timeline, taking place ~35 years ago, is shown to us in the Dolores flashback this episode. The hosts are basic, and some hosts (like Maeve and Armistice) are only just being introduced to the fold are are going through basic programming. At a very minimum, this establishes an initial timeline, as directly pointed out by Dolores (\"when are we?\"), and as proven by the buried/open church distinction. Also, Teddy's flashbacks to the \"Wyatt massacre\" closely if not perfectly mirror Dolores flashback, but that'll be important later. In order to establish the third timeline, we need to prove that...\n\n2) William = MiB\nThis has been popular since the beginning, and I think it's spelled out for the viewers at this point that William and the Man in Black are one and the same, establishing a distinction between the present and 30 years ago. There's thematic evidence behind it, such as the mirroring of William and the MiB in their picking up of Dolores's can, thinking of the park as a story that they have to finish, and the park revealing their true selves.\n\nThere is also direct evidence. MiB is a titan of industry that essentially owns the park, and William is about to marry the heiress of a company looking to invest in the park. William is about to marry when he leaves WW, and MiB was married 30 years ago (the same amount of time ago when he says he was \"essentially born\" in Westworld). MiB recognizes Elon Musk's ex-wife, surprised that WW had not retired her yet, and is surprised because she was the bot that welcomed him (William) upon his first visit 30 years ago. William is clearly undergoing a change in the park, and MiB's wife killed herself because he was a different man in the park than without. There is more than a preponderance of evidence here. MiB = William, establishing the 3rd timeline.\n\n3) Dolores is Wyatt\nThis is the big drop of this episode. As I mentioned before, Teddy's Wyatt flashback mirrors Dolores almost perfectly. We know that when hosts \"relive\" violent memories, they act them out (like when Maeve slashes Clemantine 2.0's throat remembering MiB), establishing that Dolores really did shoot a bunch of hosts and then put her gun to her head, as she does this in the present. \n\nAdditionally, if we take everything previous to be true, then we haven't seen Dolores in the MiB timeline for a WHILE. Like she's totally absent and we haven't noticed it because they've been feeding us past Dolores the whole time. If the storyline is actually taken from \"truth,\" and to line up thematically with MiB's storyline AND Teddy's Wyatt storyline, it only makes sense that Dolores would be Wyatt. Wyatt has been built up to be this big boss, but it wouldn't make any sense if Wyatt was someone we haven't already met. Dolores committed the actual massacre, and is the center of the Maze that the MiB is searching for. This episode also hinted that \"inside the maze,\" people can be killed by hosts, and Maeve's storyline shows us that the maze is a state of mind, or consciousness, or freedom or something, such that you can override your core code and hurt guests. This, if we take everything else said here to be correct, leads us to...\n\n4) Dolores killed Arnold\nDuring the massacre, Dolores killed Arnold. Arnold's death occurred at the same time as the massacre, and maybe the massacre even resulted from Arnold's work on Dolores. Dolores is somehow linked to Arnold more than any other host, and it may be the case that Arnold told her to kill him, or got her to kill him, to prove that she is conscious and solved the maze. Ford wouldn't say that he and Dolores are friends \"at all\" because she is either the host that killed his dear friend, or the creation of his arch nemesis that he can't seem to crack. Dolores is posed as the ultimate enemy here by Ford to ground in truth the way that he sees her and what she did.\n\nDamn I love this show\n\n*Edit \n\nAfter a good night's sleep and reading some of the replies, I think that it's only reasonable to come to a 5th conclusion...\n\n5) We've only been following 1 timeline.\nYup. We've been following 1 timeline the whole time. You just didn't notice it, and neither did Dolores. After the reveries were implemented (purposefully, by Ford), we start getting these alternate timelines. But the reveries are just supposed to make the hosts remember past lives. When the hosts remember, the literally \"re-live\" the memories instead of just vaguely remembering them. Dolores has been following her one timeline (her \"path\"), but has been having flashbacks, re-living past lives. When we see Dolores in the William timeline, we often see her trip out for a few seconds. Sometimes these show past versions of herself dead, showing that she got this far in the maze before but hit a literal \"dead end.\" Sometimes we see Dolores remember things that are obviously in the past, like the Wyatt massacre. STILL OTHER TIMES though, we see Dolores more or less doing the same thing that she's doing with William, except that William isn't there. THIS is when we see Dolores as she is, in the present. She is mirroring the path she took with William to bring her to the center of the maze (the Wyatt massacre town) in order to assume the mantle of \"Wyatt\" and become the villain that Ford knows she can be. She has been flashing back to William's timeline, literally retracing her steps to arrive back at the town, and it's been right under our noses the whole time. Ford intended this through the reveries, as he always intended to implement this Wyatt storyline. \n\nAnd remember, there's a path for everyone, and Teddy's path always leads him back to Dolores.

{ "subreddit" : "westworld", "title" : "The truth behind Bernard, he is actually...", "text" : "Arnold. Well technically a host made in the image of Arnold. So in short, Bernard = Arnold. \n\nThe evidence is ASTOUNDING. \n\nLets begin with a couple of simple items to get you warmed up:\n\n1. The flashback. There is a flashback of Dolores being built, we can see her head literally being placed on her shoulders. We know that Arnold built Dolores because Ford has mentioned it. See linked image below, the hands of the builder are clearly the same skin color as Bernard.\nhttp://imgur.com/5dP2fSM\n\n2. The voice. There are a few scenes where Dolores is persuaded to do something because of a voice in her head. We now know that in the generation 1 hosts, there is very literally a broadcasting system where someone can give them voice commands from anywhere (we see Elsie find the relay for one of these broadcasting systems at the end of episode 6). We have heard the voice in Dolores head a few times now. For example, one of these scenes (end of episode 2) she is told to \"wake up\", she then goes outside and finds a gun, where she hears the voice again asking her \"do you remember?\"  Very simply put, this is the voice of Jeffrey Wright (Bernard) and a computerized voice combined. It is quite obvious is you listen intently, here is a youtube video I found, the scene I mentioned is in the very beginning of this video. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6swaVzOHepY\n\n3. The photograph. In episode 3, Ford gives Bernard a photograph of what he claims to be \"his business partner Arnold\" We see this photograph from Bernard's perspective, meaning we see it as Bernard see's it. This photograph contains two people, both of which we know to NOT be Arnold. The first is obviously a younger Ford (approx 35 years ago) and the second person is Ford's father, which we learned in episode 6. We see Ford's father in Ford's cabin of ghosts. Bernard walks in and asks \"are you Arnold?\" to which the host responds \"Who the hell is Arnold?\". From this we know that Ford's father nor his brother are Arnold. Back to the photo... Ford said this is the last photo of Arnold, which is obviously not a lie. This means that Arnold is in the photo, and Bernard is incapable of seeing it.  Let's remember episode one, and the only other photograph a host has seen in the show. Dolores could not see anything in this photo, meaning a host can be programmed to not see certain things.  That is exactly whats happening with Bernard and Ford's photograph, Arnold is on the right side but Bernard cannot see him. If Bernard could see it, he would see a carbon copy of himself. See link below and observe the framing of the photo and the obvious person-sized gap to the right of Ford's father.\nhttp://imgur.com/B2j20wC\n\nON TO THE BIG ONE:\n\n4. The secret meetings. There are 4 scenes in total of short conversations between Dolores and Bernard alone. Each of these scenes takes place in a location we have never seen before, a strange basement. This basement makes no sense, it does not even resemble the lab level of Westworld we have seen before. Also, in each one of these scenes you see Bernard come into an unlit room, turn on the light and awake Dolores from her deep and dreamless slumber. Why would Dolores just be in sleep mode and sitting in a room fully clothed (unlike any other host we have seen so far)? These conversations are not between Bernard and Dolores, but a flashback of Arnold and his creation about 35 years ago. We know Arnold was more partial to the hosts than to people and his search for artificial intelligence is likely what lead to his demise. Throughout the 4 of these meetings we see Arnold's curiosity and paranoia grow. He begins the conversations by immediately asking if she has told anyone else about their private conversations and making her promise to not do so. This is Arnold attempting to hide his actions from his partner, Ford. The first of these meetings is clearly introductory, Arnold tells Dolores she's different and makes her agree to not speak of the meetings. The second, he begins building a bond with Dolores and begins trying to provoke genuine thought from her by giving her a book. The third, Arnold is beginning to show fear that these secret meetings might be a mistake and worries he should erase her memory. I think Arnold fears Ford discovering his true motivations. Dolores continues to say something unexpected and human, after which you can see Arnold's curiosity for AI come flooding back. He decides to continue the meetings. In the 4th meeting, Arnold outright tells Dolores about the maze. He wants Dolores to play the game, and find the center. If she does so, he tells her that she can be free. That is the last we see of these one on one conversations. Likely whatever happened immediately after this conversation, is what caused Arnold's demise.  \n\nSIDE NOTE ON THE BIG ONE: This is the clue that sold the whole Bernarnold theory for me. As far as we know, Bernard doesn't know ANYTHING about the maze or it's existence. In the last secret meeting, Arnold not only knows about the maze but is pushing a very self aware robot into the maze. I also want to note in this scene, Dolores is clothed. I love this detail. We have learned very little about Arnold but what we do know is this: he wanted to create artificial intelligence. The more human these robots were the more he believed he was close to that goal. We have seen Ford get visibly angry at an employee for clothing a robot, and we have heard him enforce repeatedly that these robots are not alive. This anger he feels toward the personification of the robots comes from what happened to Arnold. Arnold likely dies because of his affinity for these robots, and Ford regrets what happened to him. Therefor anytime he see's this personification he is reminded of what happened to his friend and partner, Arnold, and he refuses to allow it to happen again. \n\n\nTHE QUOTES:\n\n5. There are two repeated quotes that I believe support my Bernarnold theory. The first of which we first heard from Ford in episode 1: \"Mistakes is the word you're too embarrased to use. You ought not to be. You're a product of a trillion of them. Evolution forged the entirety of sentient life on this planet using only one tool - the mistake.\" The second time we hear the line is in episode 3, during the 3rd secret meeting between Arnold (Bernard) and Dolores. Arnold says this \"Evolution forged the entirety of sentient life on this planet using only one tool - the mistake.\" \nThe first time I caught this, I wrote it off as Bernard just repeating a quote he had heard, like we have all done before. Once I discovered that this was actually Arnold not Bernard, it hit me. This is a saying Arnold used to say, and Ford initially heard it from him during their years of friendship and partnership. Now, 30 years later, Ford is repeating that same quote back to Arnold (really a host of Arnold but ironic nonetheless). They even focus on Ford for a brief moment of reflection before cutting away. OH MY GOD, WHAT INCREDIBLE WRITING.\n\n2. The second quote: The first time we hear this quote is Bernard speaking with his wife on future skype in episode 3. She asks him about their son, \"Do you ever wish you could forget?\". He responds \"This pain, it's all I have left of him.\" The next time we hear a similar quote is in episode 4, in the 4th secret meeting between Arnold and Dolores. Dolores begins recalling what happened to her parents and how she reacted. She says \"Everyone I cared about is gone and it hurts, so bad.\" Arnold says \"I can make that feeling go away if you'd like.\" Dolores then says \"Why would I want that? The pain, their loss, it's all I have left of them.\" I think that Arnold has just heard this quote from Dolores for the first time, and like many of us do, he will repeat it later in life. Because Bernard has the consciousness and memories of Arnold, he repeats this quote to his wife nearly 30 years later.\n\n\n\nOTHER SMALLER ITEMS:\n\n6. Honestly this one caught my eye as soon as it happened and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since. When Peter Abernathy is placed in cold storage on the lower level, Bernard at the last moment leans in and says something indistinguishable to him. Initially you think its just Bernard telling Abernathy to walk forward and shut off, but he only says it to one of the two hosts going into cold storage. I don't have a great explanation for this, but at the minimum it shows that Bernard is hiding something and he might be more than he appears.\n\n7. This ones small and arguable, but I think it might be valid. I think the show has shown us tiny little things that lead us to believe that Bernard is a host. Episode 3, we see Teddy get his new backstory. The narrative of Wyatt. In the same episode, Bernard is given a backstory (at least in the eyes of the viewer) he speaks with his wife about his dead child on future skype. I know this isn't solid but when I watched it for the first time, seeing the introduction of Bernard's backstory immediately reminded me of how Teddy was given his backstory. Watch this for yourself, I can't be the only one.\n\n8. The scene in Ford's ghost cabin in episode 6. Bernard walks into the cabin and is quickly grabbed by the host of Ford's father. Bernard's voice commands do not work on the host and the moment things turn south, Ford appears out of thin air. I've read a few comments that people believe Ford froze all the hosts in this cabin, traveled from wherever he may have been, and unfroze them as soon as he was present in the cabin. We are seeing this scene from Bernard's perspective. If Bernard was frozen in time, as Ford has the ability to do to hosts, then Ford would have looked to appear out of thin air when Bernard was then unfrozen. Interesting.\n\n9. Ford may have a few specific voice commands for Bernard. One specifically is about Bernard's dead child. Anytime that Ford brings this up, Bernard's immediate reaction is to say nothing, turn and leave the premises. It has happened two times, not a huge sample size but I think still valid.\n\n\n\nTHERES A FEW THINGS YOU'RE WONDERING\n\nIf this is true, then this means that Ford most likely built Bernard in Arnold's image. Arnold and he were close friends and partners and I genuinely believe that Ford regrets how Arnold died, although obviously this is yet to be determined in the show. In the same way that Ford keeps the host of his childhood family present and operational, he keeps Bernard present and operational. We have heard Ford say that he is not the sentimental type, but we all know after seeing the cabin, he is exactly the sentimental type.\n\nThe future Skype between Bernard and his wife must be fake. It could either be a program (clearly possible in this future world) or it could simply be another host built to be Arnold's wife.\n\n\nPLEASE LET ME KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS. Thanks for reading.\n\nEDIT: I also wanted to note Arnold's attire and forgot to do so. I noticed while rewatching the secret meetings, Arnold always wears a black jacket and NO TIE. Bernard always wears a loosely worn tie (ignoring scenes of him in private with Theresa). I haven't vetted this completely but I believe its accurate.\n\n\n" }

{ "subreddit" : "westworld", "title" : "A Chronological View of Westworld's Timeline", "text" : "Click [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/5fbw8n/a_chronological_view_of_westworlds_timeline/?st=iw6e6s7p&amp;sh=d9fd461b) for the updated version (as of episode 9).\n\nLet's try to piece together a chronological view of Westworld's timeline using the information that we have from the show.\n\nFor the purpose of this post, I'll be making some assumptions which may or may not turn out to be true and with which you may or may not agree, but I'll try to back the assumptions up with information from the show:\n\n* The one-on-one sessions between Dolores and Bernard are really sessions between Dolores and Arnold.\n\n* The story with William and Dolores is taking place 30 years ago. There are a few scenes that make this theory somewhat questionable, but we'll address those when we get to them.\n\n# Time Period 1: 30-37 Years Prior to Current Events\n\n##### The Glorious Early Days (34-37 years ago)\n\n&gt; \"For three years, we lived here in the park, refining the hosts before a single guest set foot inside. Myself, a team of engineers, and my partner. His name was Arnold. Those early years were glorious. No guests, no board meetings, just pure creation. Our hosts began to pass the Turing test after the first year\" (Ford, episode 3).\n\nAccording to Bernard, Arnold wrote half the code the park was founded on 40 years ago, but this is the first period that we know of in Westworld; this was at the beginning when Ford, Arnold, and their team worked on refining the hosts and making them pass the Turing test.\n\nWe can make an estimate about when this three-year period took place. We know that Arnold died 34 years and 42 days prior to current events, we know that he died right before the park opened, and we know that he and Ford spent three years working in the park before it opened.\n\n&gt; \"Last contact: 34 years, 42 days, seven hours ago\" (the day that Arnold died) (Dolores, episode 5).\n\n&gt; \"And then right before the park opened, one of the partners killed himself\" (Logan, episode 5).\n\n&gt; \"For three years, we lived here in the park, refining the hosts before a single guest set foot inside\" (Ford, episode 3).\n\nThis means that the park opened to guests roughly 34 years ago (shortly after Arnold's demise) and they began working there three years prior to that, roughly 37 years ago.\n\nFrom Ford's flashback in episode 3 and Dolores' flashback in episode 8, we also know some of the hosts that were in the park in that period. There were [Dolores](http://imgur.com/a/wrbyp), [Maeve](http://imgur.com/a/4nnv6), [Angela](http://imgur.com/a/7k2VE), [Peter Abernathy](http://imgur.com/a/MlOdT), [Armistice](http://imgur.com/a/pw4gR), and [Lawrence's daughter](http://imgur.com/a/oe9fX).\n\n##### Dolores &amp; Arnold's Sessions (34-36 years ago)\n\n&gt; \"It's a remote diagnostic facility. Ford and his partner used them when the park was in beta. I had no idea this one was here\" (Bernard, episode 7).\n\nIn all the one-on-one sessions with Dolores, [Arnold](http://imgur.com/a/PbBtT) is wearing a dark outfit that is different from the way that [Bernard](http://imgur.com/a/j0b5n) typically dresses. This could obviously just be a jacket that Bernard wears over his normal clothes, but he only wears it in the scenes with Dolores and it might be to indicate that we're dealing with a different character.\n\nIf we assume that Dolores' sessions are with Arnold, they probably took place after the first hosts had passed the Turing test (a year after they started working in the park) and before Arnold died (34 years ago). So they took place sometime between 34-36 years ago.\n\nThey took place in one of [the diagnostic facilities](http://imgur.com/a/RgD72) that Ford and Arnold used when the park was in beta. Whether it is [the same diagnostic facility](http://imgur.com/a/Dy8yg) that Bernard and Theresa visit under Ford's house is as of yet unclear.\n\nArnold wanted these sessions to be kept secret. They were about change. Arnold seemed to have changed Dolores, be fascinated by what he saw, and want to test her further.\n\n&gt; \"I think it would be best if you not mention the things we've been talking about\" (Arnold, episode 2)\n\n&gt; \"There's something different about you, about the way you think. I find it fascinating, but others may not see it that way\" (Arnold, episode 2)\n\n&gt; \"I need to decide what to do with you. I think I made a mistake. I was just fascinated. I was being selfish, but I think it would be better if I restored you to the way you were before (...) No, Dolores. Let's see where this path leads\" (Arnold, episode 3).\n\n&gt; \"There's something I'd like you to try. It's a game. A secret. It's called the Maze. It's a very special kind of game, Dolores. The goal is to find the center of it. If you can do that, then maybe you can be free\" (Arnold, episode 4).\n\n##### The Massacre in Sweetwater and the Town with the White Church (30-36 years ago)\n\n&gt; \"The park hasn't had a critical failure in over 30 years\" (Theresa, episode 1).\n\nIn one of Dolores' [flashbacks](https://sendvid.com/kqffl8cx) in episode 8, we see the massacre in the Town with the White Church unfold. If we assume that Ford's [flashback](https://sendvid.com/8s442n5d) in episode 3, which depicts the same scene when they're dancing before the massacre begins, is from \"the early glorious years\" after the hosts passed the Turing test (34-36 years ago), it stands to reason that Dolores' flashback is from the same time. And since the park hasn't had a critical failure in over 30 years, according to Theresa, we can surmise that this event took place somtime between 30-36 years ago.\n\nWhat led to this massacre and how it unfolded is unclear, but we've seen the same massacre in Teddy's [flashback](https://sendvid.com/7lio3tz3) from his point-of-view where he shoots people with a rifle along with the mysterious Wyatt. The Union soldiers and Teddy refer to the town as Escalante. In fact, we might've even seen [Teddy](http://imgur.com/a/opuJ3) in the background in Dolores' flashback in episode 8 gunning down people. In [the trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuS5huqOND4&amp;t=1m10s) for the show, we actually see Dolores and Teddy standing together after a massacre (it should be noted, however, that Teddy in this clip is *not* wearing a solider uniform, but his usual cowboy outfit).\n\nThe other [1](https://sendvid.com/yk5sfk0p), [2](https://sendvid.com/zjrv91v3), [3](https://sendvid.com/ytrypvy5), [4](https://sendvid.com/yz1b977p) Dolores flashbacks of the Town with the White Church that we've seen don't seem to give us any more information, but rather seem to be telling a fragmented story of what led up to and/or happened after the massacre.\n\nIn episode 2, we also see a Dolores [flashback](https://sendvid.com/uq9mb70u) from Sweetwater that appears to depict a similar massacre. Whether these two events are connected is, however, as of yet unclear.\n\n&gt; \"What was the last thing he (Arnold) said to you?\" \n\n&gt; \"He told me I was going to help him. To destroy this place\" (Ford and Dolores, episode 5).\n\n&gt; \"The man I'd be asking died 35 years ago. Almost took this place with him. Almost, but not quite, thanks to me\" (The MiB, episode 5)\n\nWhether the massacre was the event where Arnold ended up dying and almost took Westworld with him remains unclear, but if it was, that means that the event took place roughly 34 years ago (unless Arnold died before the massacre, but was still the one who instigated it from beyond the grave). It also means that the MiB couldn't have been in Westworld at the time because he has only been coming to Westworld for 30 years (again, unless Arnold died before the massacre).\n\n# Time Period 2: 30 Years Prior to Current Events\n\n##### Dolores &amp; William (30 years ago)\n\n&gt; \"I've been coming here for 30 years\" (The MiB, episode 1).\n\nWilliam and Logan arrive at Westworld where they are greeted by [Angela](http://imgur.com/a/Mspqj) in her new build as \"Greeter Host\".\n\n* This is where we get [the old Westworld logo](http://imgur.com/a/Nazq1), which we also see on [a computer](http://imgur.com/a/YUdFm) and on a [tech coat](http://imgur.com/a/IpPfG), versus [the new Westworld logo](http://imgur.com/a/xJg64) argument.\n\nWilliam and Logan arrive in Sweetwater where they spend the night before going on the bounty hunt to find Slim.\n\n* When they arrive, we see that the narrative with [the Sheriff recruiting people](https://sendvid.com/2f0jt89p) to help capture Hector from the current time period is replaced with a narrative with [union soldier recruting people](https://sendvid.com/2sdimmyc) to fight in the war.\n\n* When they arrive, we also see [Clementine and the old Brothel Madam](https://sendvid.com/uvzagr1i) standing outside the Mariposa where [Clementine and Maeve](https://sendvid.com/v68e62sg) usually stands in the current time period. We also see Clementine and the old Brothel Madam in the [Westworld advert](https://sendvid.com/feiopllx) that Maeve sees in the current time period.\n\nWhile out on the bounty hount for Slim, Dolores stumbles upon them at night and wakes up in their camp the next morning. Dolores wakes up on a blanket [with a gun in her hand](https://sendvid.com/nyo3mhko) with William next to her.\n\n* The obvious thing to extrapolate from this as a viewer is that this is the same Dolores that we just saw in the current time period who remembered her encounter with the MiB in the barn and her old father (Peter), who killed the outlaw (Rebus) who wanted to rape her, and who escaped from his gang. However, for the two time periods theory to be true, one of two things has to have happened: 1) We have to have seen current Dolores wake up alone with a gun in her hand on a blanket that she brought and then the scene cut back to 30 years ago with William next to her, or 2) There were similar events that led up to her going off loop 30 years ago and in the current timeline and we just didn't see the events 30 years ago (meaning this is the first time that we meet Dolores from 30 years ago in the show).\n\nThey decide to bring Dolores with them on their hunt and go to Lawrence's hometown where they encounter someone who wants to bring Dolores back to Abernathy ranch, but William says she's with him.\n\n* Again, we encounter a problem. This scene follows a scene where a female Westworld staffer tells Stubbs in the current time period (she references Ford's new narrative) that Dolores is off her loop and it's unclear if she's with a guest, and Stubbs tells her to flag Dolores with Behavior and send someone to check it out. So it's obvious to extrapolate that the scene in Lawrence's hometown where someone comes to get her is a result of that scene. For the two time periods theory to be true, one of two things has to have happened: 1) The guy who grabs Dolores is just a host that randomly tries to bring Dolores back to where she belongs, but stops when she's with a guest, or 2) Westworld sent someone 30 years ago to check up on Dolores just like they do in the current time period, which could be true because it's probably normal protocol to check up on hosts that make big deviations (but it's unclear why they didn't know that she was with a guest 30 years ago?).\n\nThey find and capture Slim who tells them about \"El Lazo\" Lawrence in Pariah. They go to Pariah where they meet Lawrence, help him out with the nitro, lose Logan, and join Lawrence on the train to the Front. \n\nThey travel through Ghost Nation terrirory, William and Dolores sleep together, and the train is attacked by Confederados whom they escape from. \n\nThey arrive at a place that Dolores has drawn from her imagination (where the mountains meet the sea), they part ways with Lawrence, they come across a lake where Dolores feels she's been before and they meet a young Confederado, and then they arrive in Nowhere Land (the place where the Town with the White Church used to be). \n\nDolores starts reliving past memories from the massacre, and William tells her that they have to get out of there because this place is bad for her. They run into Logan who had been looking for them and tells them they are in trouble.\n\n&gt; “Then, when are we? Is this now? Am I going mad? Are you real? I can't tell anymore. It's like I'm trapped in a dream or a memory from a life long ago. One minute, I'm here with you, and the next... This is what Arnold wants. He wants me to remember” (Dolores, episode 8).\n\nThere are a couple of things that we have to keep in mind as viewers when watching Dolores' story with William that seems to have scenes that contradict the two time periods theory.\n\n* The show's creators want us to be confused. They want it to be intentionally ambiguous. If the theory is indeed correct, they don't want you to be sure of it right away, but at the same time they want you to be able to look back at it and see that they knew what they were doing. This requires some scenes that are vague.\n\n* We're watching this from Dolores' point-of-view. Not only is she discombobulated and doesn't understand what's going on, but she's experiencing several time periods simultaneously (the massacre, the one with William, and the current one). Felix explains to us that the hosts recall memories perfectly and actually relive them (episode 8). This would make anyone's perspective difficult to understand.\n\n# Time Period 3: 1 Year Prior to Current Events\n\n##### Maeve &amp; the Man in Black (1 year ago)\n\n&gt; \"You've only been the madam at the Mariposa for the last year or so\" (Felix, episode 6).\n\n&gt; \"Then, last year, my wife took the wrong pills. Fell asleep in the bath. Tragic accident\" (The MiB, episode 8).\n\nDespite believing that she's been the madam at the Mariposa for the past 10 years, from a time unknown until roughly a year ago, Maeve was in a role as an ordinary homesteader living with her daughter. From her flashbacks, we see that part of her narrative includes her being attacked by Natives.\n\nA year ago, the MiB's wife dies by drowning in the bathtub, something which he calls an accident, but which his daughter, Emily, calls suicide.\n\n&gt; \"Then, at the funeral, I tried to console my daughter. She pushed me away, told me that my wife's death was no accident... that she killed herself because of me. Emily said that every day with me had been sheer terror. At any point, I could blow up or collapse like some dark star. (...) She said if I stacked up all my good deeds, it was just an elegant wall I built to hide what's inside from everyone, and from myself. I had to prove her wrong, so I came back here\" (The Mib, episode 8).\n\n&gt; \"But that time, I didn't join one of Ford's stories, I created my own. A test. A very simple one. I found a woman, an ordinary homesteader and her daughter. I wanted to see if I had it in me to do something truly evil. To see what I was really made of. I killed her and her daughter just to see what I felt. I felt nothing. Then, just when I thought it was done... the woman refused to die. And then something miraculous happened. In all my years coming here, I had never seen anything like it. She was alive, truly alive, if only for a moment. And that was when the maze revealed itself to me. The maze\" (The MiB, episode 8).\n\nThis is the first time in his 30 years of coming to the park that the Maze has revealed itself to him and that he has experienced a host being truly alive. This was the incident that started his quest in the current time period to find the center of the Maze.\n\nMaeve, meanwhile, is emotionally destroyed by the death of her child and has to be brought in to Westworld offices for diagnostics.\n\n&gt; Westworld tech: \"Sir, she won't respond to verbal commands. We can't shut her down\"\n\n&gt; Bernard: \"I don't understand. She's not responding to anything. Her cognition's fragmented\"\n\n&gt; Ford (plays Reveries song): \"There. That's better. An old trick from an old friend. You need not suffer, Maeve. I'll take it from you. Give yourself now to a deep, dreamless slumber. Perhaps a fresh start, a new role for you. And tomorrow, this will be simply a distant dream\" (episode 8).\n\nWhen her memory wipe is complete, Maeve takes a knife to her own throat. The next time we meet her, she's the madam at the Mariposa in the current timeline.\n\n# Time Period 4: Current Events\n\n##### Dolores (the present)\n\n&gt; \"Sometimes I feel... like something's calling me. Telling me there's a place for me somewhere beyond all this\" (Dolores, episode 4).\n\nDolores is in her daily loop when she and Teddy encounter the MiB at Abernathy ranch. He takes her to the barn and pulls out his knife.\n\n&gt; \"Why don't we reacquaint ourselves, Dolores? Start at the beginning\" (The MiB, episode 1).\n\nHer dad loses it after finding a picture and utters the phrase \"these violent delights have violent ends\" to her, which she in turn utters to Maeve. She starts hearing Arnold's voice and recalling past events.\n\nWhen Rebus tries to rape her at Abernathy ranch in one of her loops, she remembers her previous father and her encounter with the MiB. She kills Rebus on Arnold's orders, escapes his gang, and takes off on her own.\n\nA Westworld staffer tells Stubbs that Dolores is making a big deviation from her loop and it's unclear if she's being accompanied by a guest because Ford's new narrative is causing trouble. He tells her to flag Dolores with Behavior and check up on it.\n\nDolores arrives in Lawrence's hometown where she meets Lawrence's daughter who tells her they come from the same place. \n\n* We see that [the daughter disappears](https://sendvid.com/ehvf8lx6) when the story flashes back to her journey with William 30 years ago.\n\nDolores arrives in the graveyard outside Pariah alone. She goes through Pariah and boards the train to the outskirts of the park.\n\n* We see that [William and Lawrence disappear](https://sendvid.com/qbpwho7y) when the story flashes forward to her journey in the present (it is, however, curious that she is wearing the same outfit as she was 30 years ago?).\n\nDolores arrives at the lake where William and Dolores met the young Confederado 30 years ago.\n\n* We see that [William and the young Confederado disappear](https://sendvid.com/7axs1528) when the story flashes forward to her journey in the present when she sees herself drowned in the lake.\n\nDolores arrives at the Town with White Church.\n\n* We see that she is alone in [the last half of the clip](https://sendvid.com/k08wtb47) where she sees that the town with the White Church has been rebuilt as part of Ford's new narrative and is completely abandoned (when she was there with William 30 years ago, there was only the black spire, and when she was remembering it from the massacre days, it was full of life).\n\n##### The Man in Black (the present)\n\n&gt; \"It's the maze, the deepest level of this game. You're gonna help me find the entrance\" (The MiB, episode 2).\n\nThe MiB encounters Dolores and takes her to the barn to get reacquainted. He then goes to Sweetwater to find the dealer, Kissy, who \"gives\" him the Maze map and tells him about his friend, Lawrence.\n\nHe saves Lawrence from the hangman's noose and takes him to his hometown where he kills everyone and uses Lawrence's family to find the next clue to his journey. A Westworld staffer informs Stubbs about what the MiB is doing, but Stubbs replies \"that gentleman gets whatever he wants\".\n\nThe MiB and Lawrence find Armistice who offers the next clue in exchange for assistance in breaking Hector out of jail. The MiB does this and is told about Wyatt, the villain of Ford's new narrative.\n\nThe MiB and Lawrence take off to find Wyatt and encounter Teddy who's been left for dead by Wyatt's gang. They bring him along and the MiB kills Lawrence and uses his blood to keep Teddy alive in order to find Wyatt. \n\nThe MiB convinces Teddy to come along by saying that Wyatt has Dolores. They go into a bar where they meet Ford who asks what they're doing, gives them his blessing, and fixes Teddy.\n\nThey have to get over the border, but Pariah is closed, so they take a more treacherous path. They encounter Angela in her new build as one of Wyatt's henchmen.\n\n&gt; The MiB: “It’s you. I figured they retired you. Guess Ford never likes to waste a pretty face” (episode 8).\n\n* Angela is like an anchor of the story. She's the Desmond of Westworld, if you've watched Lost. We see her in her earliest build as [woman with umbrella](http://imgur.com/a/7k2VE), then we see her as Greeter Host when she [welcomes William](http://imgur.com/a/Mspqj) and in [the Westworld advert](http://imgur.com/a/Vua5v), and now we see her as [one of Wyatt's henchmen](http://imgur.com/a/kiqPD).\n\nTeddy remembers what the MiB did to Dolores and knocks him out. Teddy takes him to a camp fire where they discuss the MiB's past. Angela turns out to be in league with Wyatt and stabs Teddy in the chest.\n\n##### Commonalities between the MiB and William\n\n&gt; \"Is that any way to treat an old friend? I've been coming here for 30 years, but you still don't remember me, do you? After all we've been through. They gave you a little more pluck, Dolores. Absolutely charming\" (The MiB, episode 1).\n\n###### Commonality 1: \"There's a Path for Everyone\"\n\n&gt; \"I used to believe there was a path for everyone\" (Dolores to William, episode 4).\n\n&gt; \"As another old friend of mine likes to say, *there's a path for everyone*\" (The MiB, episode 5)\n\n###### Commonality 2: Stories\n\n&gt; “The only thing I had when I was a kid were books. I used to live in them. I used to go to sleep dreaming I'd wake up inside one of them 'cause they had meaning. This place, this is like I woke up inside one of those stories. I guess I just wanna find out what it means” (William, episode 7).\n\n&gt; \"This whole world is a story. I've read every page except the last one. I need to find out how it ends. I want to know what this all means\" (The MiB, season 4).\n\n###### Commonality 3: Marriage\n\n&gt; \"Dolores, back home, there's a woman, Juliet, and her father owns the company where I work. She's Logan's sister. And when I get home, we're getting married” (William, episode 7).\n\n&gt; \"Then, last year, my wife took the wrong pills. Fell asleep in the bath. Tragic accident. 30 years of marriage vanished\" (The MiB, episode 8).\n\n###### Commonality 4: Your True Self\n\n&gt; “I used to think this place was all  about pandering to your baser instincts. Now I understand. It doesn't cater to your lowest self, it reveals your deepest self. It shows you who you really are\" (William, episode 7).\n\n&gt; \"Because that's what this place does, right? Reveals your true self\" (The MiB, episode 8).\n\n###### Commonality 5: Intimidation Factor\n\n&gt; \"I picked you precisely because you will never be a threat to anyone. My sister probably picked you for the same reason\" (Logan to William, episode 5).\n\n&gt; “There is not a man in the world that would take the tone with me that you do. *In a past life perhaps*” (The MiB to Lawrence, episode 5).\n\n###### Commonality 6: On Adventures with Lawrence\n\n&gt; “You and I hunted down Ghost Nation braves in their winter grounds. I know the whiskey you like to drink. I know the tune you whistle when you’re taking a piss” (The MiB to Lawrence, episode 2)." }

Aside from the circumstantial evidence in the show (Bernard saying hosts literally couldn't hurt a fly, staff mentioning a \"fly problem\", etc.), the official Westworld website has kinda an easter egg where they lay out the terms and conditions for a stay at westworld. here is the relevant bit :   \n\n&gt;(d) All livestock within the Delos parks are Hosts, with the notable exception of flies. All humanoid and animal Hosts within Delos parks work to keep guests safe, even when the narrative calls for them to appear to endanger guests. Please note, the appearance of danger is not the same as true danger, and all Hosts utilize the Good SamaritanTM reflex to prevent bodily harm." }

{ "subreddit" : "westworld", "title" : "A Chronological View of Westworld's Timeline (updated - episode 9)", "text" : "Let's try to piece together a chronological view of Westworld's timeline using the information that we have from the show.\n\n* **The parts highlighted with *\"bold\"* are based on the information revealed in the most recent episode (episode 9).**\n\n# Time Period 1: 30-37 Years Prior to Current Events\n\n##### The Glorious Early Days (34-37 years ago)\n\n&gt; \"For three years, we lived here in the park, refining the hosts before a single guest set foot inside. Myself, a team of engineers, and my partner. His name was Arnold. Those early years were glorious. No guests, no board meetings, just pure creation. Our hosts began to pass the Turing test after the first year\" (Ford, episode 3).\n\nAccording to Bernard, Arnold wrote half the code the park was founded on 40 years ago, but this is the first period that we know of in Westworld; this was at the beginning when Ford, Arnold, and their team worked on refining the hosts and making them pass the Turing test.\n\nWe can make an estimate about when this three-year period took place. We know that Arnold died 34 years and 42 days prior to current events, we know that he died right before the park opened, and we know that he and Ford spent three years working in the park before it opened.\n\n&gt; \"Last contact: 34 years, 42 days, seven hours ago\" (the day that Arnold died) (Dolores, episode 5).\n\n&gt; \"And then right before the park opened, one of the partners killed himself\" (Logan, episode 5).\n\n&gt; \"For three years, we lived here in the park, refining the hosts before a single guest set foot inside\" (Ford, episode 3).\n\nThis means that the park opened to guests roughly 34 years ago (shortly after Arnold's demise) and they began working there three years prior to that, roughly 37 years ago.\n\nFrom Ford's flashback in episode 3 and Dolores' flashback in episode 8, we also know some of the hosts that were in the park in that period. There were [Dolores](http://imgur.com/a/wrbyp), [Maeve](http://imgur.com/a/4nnv6), [Angela](http://imgur.com/a/7k2VE), [Peter Abernathy](http://imgur.com/a/MlOdT), [Armistice](http://imgur.com/a/pw4gR), [Lawrence's daughter](http://imgur.com/a/oe9fX), [Teddy Flood](http://imgur.com/a/x9qgi), and [Rebus](http://imgur.com/a/hcWOp).\n_____\n\n##### Dolores &amp; Arnold's Sessions (34-36 years ago)\n\n&gt; \"There's something I'd like you to try. It's a game. A secret. It's called the Maze. It's a very special kind of game, Dolores. The goal is to find the center of it. If you can do that, then maybe you can be free\" (Arnold, episode 4). \n\n**These sessions are between Dolores and Arnold, since we know that [Bernard is made in the image of Arnold](http://imgur.com/a/YpZqH). These sessions take place in a diagnostic facility under the White Church, since we see [Dolores enter this facility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh7AK5qCLsA) through the White Church in one of her flashbacks.**\n\n&gt; \"It's a remote diagnostic facility. Ford and his partner used them when the park was in beta. I had no idea this one was here\" (Bernard, episode 7).\n\nThey probably took place after the first hosts had passed the Turing test (a year after they started working in the park) and before Arnold died (34 years ago). So they took place sometime between 34-36 years ago.\n\n**The sessions between Arnold and Dolores were held in secret.**\n\n&gt; \"I think it would be best if you not mention the things we've been talking about\" (Arnold, episode 2)\n\n**In the first two sessions we see (episode 2-3), they talk about change, and Arnold seems facinated by Dolores, whom he finds different and special.**\n\n&gt; \"There's something different about you, about the way you think. I find it fascinating, but others may not see it that way\" (Arnold, episode 2)\n\n&gt; \"It's like the other books we've read. It's about change. Seems to be a common theme (Dolores, episode 3).\n\n**In the third session (episode 3), Arnold seems to have doubts about what he is doing with Dolores, but when she starts showing signs of human consciousness, he decides to keep going down the path that they've started.**\n\n&gt; \"I need to decide what to do with you. I think I made a mistake. I was just fascinated. I was being selfish, but I think it would be better if I restored you to the way you were before (...) No, Dolores. Let's see where this path leads\" (Arnold, episode 3).\n\n**In the fourth session (episode 4), Arnold decides to let Dolores try \"the Maze\" game. He sends her away from the Town with the White Church to travel the path of the Maze.**\n\n&gt; \"There's something I'd like you to try. It's a game. A secret. It's called the Maze. It's a very special kind of game, Dolores. The goal is to find the center of it. If you can do that, then maybe you can be free\" (Arnold, episode 4). \n\n**In the fifth session (episode 9), we see Dolores return to the Town with the White Church and reunite with Arnold after having traveled the path of the Maze.**\n\n&gt; **\"You came back. It's very good to see you, Dolores\"**\n\n&gt; **\"I've been looking for you. You told me to follow the Maze. That it would bring me joy. But all I found was pain and terror\" (Arnold and Dolores, episode 9).**\n\n**The fact that Dolores has been away from the Town with White Church on her journey and has found her way back is further substantiated by Lawrence's daughter, who asks Dolores if she found what she went looking for upon Dolores' return to the town.**\n\n&gt; \"Good morning. Did you find what you were looking for, Dolores?\" (Lawrence's daughter, episode 8).\n\n**So Dolores and Arnold's sessions began in secret under the White Church, then Arnold sent Dolores away to travel the path of the Maze, and then she returned to the town upon having completed the Maze.**\n_____\n\n##### The Massacre in Sweetwater and the Town with the White Church/Escalante (30-34 years ago)\n\n&gt; \"The park hasn't had a critical failure in over 30 years\" (Bernard, episode 1).\n\nIn one of Dolores' [flashbacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImnW-b3RJQA) in episode 8, we see the massacre in the Town with the White Church unfold. If we assume that Ford's [flashback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBx2Z2fpvsw) in episode 3, which depicts the same scene when they're dancing before the massacre begins, is from \"the early glorious years\" after the hosts passed the Turing test (34-36 years ago), it stands to reason that Dolores' flashback is from the same time. And since the park hasn't had a critical failure in over 30 years, according to Theresa, we can surmise that this event took place somtime between 30-34 years ago.\n\nWhat led to this massacre and how it unfolded is unclear, **but we've seen the same massacre in Teddy's [flashback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bpzmrxUECU) from his point-of-view where he shoots people with a rifle along with the mysterious Wyatt.** The Union soldiers and Teddy refer to the town as Escalante. In fact, we might've even seen [Teddy](http://imgur.com/a/opuJ3) in the background in Dolores' flashback in episode 8 gunning down people. In [the trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuS5huqOND4&amp;t=1m10s) for the show, we actually see Dolores and Teddy standing together after a massacre. **It seems that the Wyatt narrative has been uploaded as a reflection of what actually happened during the massacre.**\n\n&gt; **\"No. No, I couldn't have\"**\n\n&gt; **\"You did. And you will again. This time we'll be fighting with you. When Wyatt returns, you'll be by his side in the city swallowed by sand\" (Teddy and Angela, episode 9).**\n\nThe other Dolores flashbacks of the Town with the White Church that we've seen don't seem to give us any more information, but rather seem to be telling a fragmented story of what led up to and/or happened after the massacre.\n\nIn episode 2, we also see a Dolores [flashback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95kQip2I8j8) from Sweetwater that appears to depict a similar massacre. Whether these two events are connected is, however, as of yet unclear.\n\n&gt; \"What was the last thing he (Arnold) said to you?\" \n\n&gt; \"He told me I was going to help him. To destroy this place\" (Ford and Dolores, episode 5).\n\n&gt; \"The man I'd be asking died 35 years ago. Almost took this place with him. Almost, but not quite, thanks to me\" (The MiB, episode 5)\n\nWhether the massacre was the event where Arnold ended up dying and almost took Westworld with him remains unclear, but if it was, that means that the event took place roughly 34 years ago (unless Arnold died before the massacre, but was still the one who instigated it from beyond the grave). It also means that the MiB couldn't have been in Westworld at the time because he has only been coming to Westworld for 30 years (again, unless Arnold died before the massacre).\n_____\n\n# Time Period 2: 30 Years Prior to Current Events\n\n##### Dolores &amp; William (30 years ago)\n\n&gt; \"I've been coming here for 30 years\" (The MiB, episode 1).\n\nWilliam and Logan arrive at Westworld where they are greeted by [Angela](http://imgur.com/a/Mspqj) in her new build as \"Greeter Host\".\n\n* This is where we get [the old Westworld logo](http://imgur.com/a/Nazq1), which we also see on [a computer](http://imgur.com/a/YUdFm) and on a [tech coat](http://imgur.com/a/IpPfG), versus [the new Westworld logo](http://imgur.com/a/xJg64) argument.\n\nWilliam and Logan arrive in Sweetwater where they spend the night before going on the bounty hunt to find Slim. Just before going on the bounty hunt, William has his first encounter with Dolores who drops the can that William picks up (mirroring both Teddy and the MiB).\n\n* When they arrive, we see that the narrative with [the Sheriff recruiting people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFndFahnxAA) to help capture Hector from the current time period is replaced with a narrative with [union soldier recruting people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFtUwJBWU8A) to fight in the war, which is presumably the equivalent narrative from 30 years ago.\n\n* When they arrive, we also see [Clementine and the old Brothel Madam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atbD87Om1b8) standing outside the Mariposa where [Clementine and Maeve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWlrkD02mwo) usually stands in the current time period. We also see Clementine and the old Brothel Madam in the [Westworld advert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBs2GLCkWmU) that Maeve sees in the current time period.\n\nWhile out on the bounty hount for Slim, Dolores stumbles upon them at night and wakes up in their camp the next morning. Dolores wakes up on a blanket [with a gun in her hand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KJgcxsqRrU) with William next to her.\n\n* The obvious thing to extrapolate from this as a viewer is that this is the same Dolores that we just saw in the current time period who remembered her encounter with the MiB in the barn and her old father (Peter), who killed the outlaw (Rebus) who wanted to rape her, and who escaped from his gang. However, for the two time periods theory to be true, one of two things has to have happened: 1) We have to have seen current Dolores wake up alone with a gun in her hand on a blanket that she brought and then the scene cut back to 30 years ago with William next to her, or 2) There were similar events that led up to her going off loop 30 years ago and in the current timeline, and we just didn't see the events 30 years ago.\n\nThey decide to bring Dolores with them on their hunt and go to Lawrence's hometown where they encounter someone who wants to bring Dolores back to Abernathy ranch, but William says she's with him.\n\n* Again, we encounter a problem. This scene follows a scene where a female Westworld staffer tells Stubbs in the current time period (she references Ford's new narrative) that Dolores is off her loop and it's unclear if she's with a guest, and Stubbs tells her to flag Dolores with Behavior and send someone to check it out. So it's obvious to extrapolate that the scene in Lawrence's hometown where someone comes to get her is a result of that scene. For the two time periods theory to be true, one of two things has to have happened: 1) The guy who grabs Dolores is just a host that randomly tries to bring Dolores back to where she belongs, but stops when she's with a guest, or 2) Westworld sent someone 30 years ago to check up on Dolores just like they do in the current time period, which could be true because it's probably normal protocol to check up on hosts that make big deviations (but it's unclear why they didn't know that she was with a guest 30 years ago?).\n\nThey find and capture Slim who tells them about \"El Lazo\" Lawrence in Pariah. They go to Pariah where they meet Lawrence, help him out with the nitro, lose Logan, and join Lawrence on the train to the Front. \n\nThey travel through Ghost Nation terrirory, William and Dolores sleep together, and the train is attacked by Confederados whom they escape from. \n\nThey arrive at a place that Dolores has drawn from her imagination (where the mountains meet the sea), they part ways with Lawrence, they come across a lake where Dolores feels she's been before and they meet a young Confederado, and then they arrive in Nowhere Land (the place where the Town with the White Church used to be). \n\nDolores starts reliving past memories from the massacre, and William tells her that they have to get out of there because this place is bad for her. They run into Logan who had been looking for them and tells them they are in trouble.\n\n**Dolores and William are taken to a camp of soldiers where Logan is now General. Logan tortures Dolores and wants William to come back to reality and realize it's just a game.**\n\n* **This is where we see Logan give William [the picture of his sister](http://imgur.com/a/7Qtbo), which is [the same picture that Peter Abernathy finds](http://imgur.com/a/pxshk) in the present time period causing him to question his reality.**\n\n**Dolores manages to escape and William tells her he'll catch up. William pretends to make up with Logan, who drinks till he passes out. While Logan is passed out, William kills all the soldiers and finally understands how to play the game. He tells Logan that he's going to find Dolores and that Logan is going to help him.**\n\n_____\n\n&gt; “Then, when are we? Is this now? Am I going mad? Are you real? I can't tell anymore. It's like I'm trapped in a dream or a memory from a life long ago. One minute, I'm here with you, and the next... This is what Arnold wants. He wants me to remember” (Dolores, episode 8).\n\nThere are a couple of things that we have to keep in mind as viewers when watching Dolores' story with William that seems to have scenes that contradict the two time periods theory.\n\n* The show's creators want us to be confused. They want it to be intentionally ambiguous. If the theory is indeed correct, they don't want you to be sure of it right away, but at the same time they want you to be able to look back at it and see that they knew what they were doing. This requires some scenes that are vague.\n\n* We're watching this from Dolores' point-of-view. Not only is she discombobulated and doesn't understand what's going on, but she's experiencing several time periods simultaneously (the massacre, the one with William, and the current one). Felix explains to us that the hosts recall memories perfectly and actually relive them (episode 8). This would make anyone's perspective difficult to understand.\n_____\n\n# Time Period 3: 1 Year Prior to Current Events\n\n##### Maeve &amp; the Man in Black (1 year ago)\n\n&gt; \"You've only been the madam at the Mariposa for the last year or so\" (Felix, episode 6).\n\n&gt; \"Then, last year, my wife took the wrong pills. Fell asleep in the bath. Tragic accident\" (The MiB, episode 8).\n\nDespite believing that she's been the madam at the Mariposa for the past 10 years, from a time unknown until roughly a year ago, Maeve was in a role as an ordinary homesteader living with her daughter. From her flashbacks, we see that part of her narrative includes her being attacked by Natives.\n\nA year ago, the MiB's wife dies by drowning in the bathtub, something which he calls an accident, but which his daughter, Emily, calls suicide.\n\n&gt; \"Then, at the funeral, I tried to console my daughter. She pushed me away, told me that my wife's death was no accident... that she killed herself because of me. Emily said that every day with me had been sheer terror. At any point, I could blow up or collapse like some dark star. (...) She said if I stacked up all my good deeds, it was just an elegant wall I built to hide what's inside from everyone, and from myself. I had to prove her wrong, so I came back here\" (The Mib, episode 8).\n\n&gt; \"But that time, I didn't join one of Ford's stories, I created my own. A test. A very simple one. I found a woman, an ordinary homesteader and her daughter. I wanted to see if I had it in me to do something truly evil. To see what I was really made of. I killed her and her daughter just to see what I felt. I felt nothing. Then, just when I thought it was done... the woman refused to die. And then something miraculous happened. In all my years coming here, I had never seen anything like it. She was alive, truly alive, if only for a moment. And that was when the maze revealed itself to me\" (The MiB, episode 8).\n\nThis is the first time in his 30 years of coming to the park that the Maze has revealed itself to him and that he has experienced a host being truly alive. This was the incident that started his quest in the current time period to find the center of the Maze.\n\nMaeve, meanwhile, is emotionally destroyed by the death of her child and has to be brought in to Westworld offices for diagnostics.\n\n&gt; Westworld tech: \"Sir, she won't respond to verbal commands. We can't shut her down\"\n\n&gt; Bernard: \"I don't understand. She's not responding to anything. Her cognition's fragmented\"\n\n&gt; Ford (plays Reveries song): \"There. That's better. An old trick from an old friend. You need not suffer, Maeve. I'll take it from you. Give yourself now to a deep, dreamless slumber. Perhaps a fresh start, a new role for you. And tomorrow, this will be simply a distant dream\" (episode 8).\n\nWhen her memory wipe is complete, Maeve takes a knife to her own throat. The next time we meet her, she's the madam at the Mariposa in the current timeline.\n\n**After Maeve has killed herself, Bernard questions Ford about what just happened. He doesn't understand how she could kill herself over a memory that was just erased. It causes Bernard to crash.**\n\n&gt; **“But how could she destroy herself over a memory that you just erased from her mind?”**\n\n&gt; **“Creatures often go to extremes to protect themselves from pain”**\n\n&gt; **“Living beings. Not hosts. It would signal a change, a level of empathic response outside what she's programmed to exhibit. Something like… like…” (Bernard and Ford, episode 9)**\n_____\n\n# Time Period 4: Current Events\n\n##### Dolores (the present)\n\n&gt; \"Sometimes I feel... like something's calling me. Telling me there's a place for me somewhere beyond all this\" (Dolores, episode 4).\n\nDolores is in her daily loop when she and Teddy encounter the MiB at Abernathy ranch. He takes her to the barn and pulls out his knife.\n\n&gt; \"Why don't we reacquaint ourselves, Dolores? Start at the beginning\" (The MiB, episode 1).\n\nHer dad loses it after finding a picture (we now know that the picture is of Logan's sister and presumably William/the MiB's late wife) and utters the phrase \"these violent delights have violent ends\" to her, which she in turn utters to Maeve. She starts hearing Arnold's voice and recalling past events.\n\nWhen Rebus tries to rape her at Abernathy ranch in one of her loops, she remembers her previous father and her encounter with the MiB. She kills Rebus on Arnold's orders, escapes his gang, and takes off on her own.\n\nA Westworld staffer tells Stubbs that Dolores is making a big deviation from her loop and it's unclear if she's being accompanied by a guest because Ford's new narrative is causing trouble. He tells her to flag Dolores with Behavior and check up on it.\n\nDolores arrives in Lawrence's hometown where she meets Lawrence's daughter who tells her they come from the same place. \n\n* We see that [the daughter disappears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8ftNH-UajY) when the story flashes back to her journey with William 30 years ago.\n\nDolores arrives in the graveyard outside Pariah alone. She goes through Pariah and boards the train to the outskirts of the park.\n\n* We see that [William and Lawrence disappear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM3dGlLWNA) when the story flashes forward to her journey in the present (it is, however, curious that she is wearing the same outfit as she was 30 years ago?).\n\nDolores arrives at the lake where William and Dolores met the young Confederado 30 years ago.\n\n* We see that [William and the young Confederado disappear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0eE_BEfcc8) when the story flashes forward to her journey in the present when she sees herself dead in the lake.\n\nDolores arrives at the Town with White Church.\n\n* We see that she is alone in [the last half of the clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyUBERbCx5E) where she sees that the town with the White Church has been rebuilt as part of Ford's new narrative and is completely abandoned (when she was there with William 30 years ago, there was only the black spire, and when she was remembering it from the massacre days, it was full of life).\n\n**Dolores leaves the Town with the White Church, retracing her memories from 30 years ago and what happened during her time with William. Hosts don't recall, but litereally relive memories, so in the present she is following the same path that she followed 30 years ago that took her away from the Town with the White Church and back again.**\n\n* **We see that [the knife wound in her stomach disappears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgbPPx-dO8Q) when the story flashes forward to the current time period.**\n\n**Dolores again arrives in the Town with the White Church, and this time she enters the town.**\n\n* **We see [Dolores enter the town alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsm43J-EnXY), which is currently completely abandoned.**\n\n**Dolores enters the White Church and goes through the passage to the underground diagnostics facility where she sits alone. All the while, she is remembering having walked a similar path 34 years ago that led her to Arnold.**\n\n* **We see Dolores walking up to the White Church in the present and [then flashing back to memories from 34 years ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGoD-NNQ9PE) when she was in her blue dress**\n\n**When Dolores reemerges in the Church, someone is about to enter the Church. Dolores hopefully says \"William...\", but is horrified when it turns out to be the MiB.**\n_____\n\n##### The Man in Black (the present)\n\n&gt; \"It's the maze, the deepest level of this game. You're gonna help me find the entrance\" (The MiB, episode 2).\n\nThe MiB encounters Dolores and takes her to the barn to get reacquainted. He then goes to Sweetwater to find the dealer, Kissy, who \"gives\" him the Maze map and tells him about his friend, Lawrence.\n\nHe saves Lawrence from the hangman's noose and takes him to his hometown where he kills everyone and uses Lawrence's family to find the next clue to his journey, despite Lawrence's daughter telling him that the Maze isn't meant for him. \n\nA Westworld staffer informs Stubbs about what the MiB is doing, but Stubbs replies \"that gentleman gets whatever he wants\".\n\nThe MiB and Lawrence find Armistice who offers the next clue in exchange for assistance in breaking Hector out of jail. The MiB does this and is told about Wyatt, the villain of Ford's new narrative.\n\nThe MiB and Lawrence take off to find Wyatt and encounter Teddy who's been left for dead by Wyatt's gang. They bring him along and the MiB kills Lawrence and uses his blood to keep Teddy alive in order to find Wyatt. \n\nThe MiB convinces Teddy to come along by saying that Wyatt has Dolores. They go into a bar where they meet Ford who asks what they're doing, gives them his blessing, and fixes Teddy.\n\nThey have to get over the border, but Pariah is closed, so they take a more treacherous path. They encounter Angela in her new build as one of Wyatt's henchmen.\n\n&gt; The MiB: “It’s you. I figured they retired you. Guess Ford never likes to waste a pretty face” (episode 8).\n\n* Angela is like an anchor of the story. She's the Desmond of Westworld, if you've watched Lost. We see her in her earliest build as [woman with umbrella](http://imgur.com/a/7k2VE), then we see her as \"Greeter Host\" when she [welcomes William](http://imgur.com/a/Mspqj) and in [the Westworld advert](http://imgur.com/a/Vua5v), and now we see her as [one of Wyatt's henchmen](http://imgur.com/a/kiqPD).\n\nTeddy remembers what the MiB did to Dolores and knocks him out. Teddy takes him to a camp fire where they discuss the MiB's past. Angela turns out to be in league with Wyatt and stabs Teddy in the chest.\n\n**Angela makes Teddy remember the massacre and tells the MiB that the Maze isn't meant for him (echoing Lawrence's daughter). She tells him to try one of their games and knocks him out.**\n\n**When the MiB wakes up, he has a rope around his throat which is tied to his horse. He gets free and meets Hale, who wants the MiB's help to push out Ford, as the MiB is apparently a member of the board and the one responsible for Ford having been kept in business \"all those years ago\".**\n\n&gt; **“Most of the guests just want a warm body to shoot or to fuck. They would be perfectly happy with something a little less baroque. And so would the board”**\n\n&gt; **“That’s why you’re here? You want my vote to push Ford out?”**\n\n&gt; **“I like for these things to be unanimous. After all, it was you who kept Ford in business all those years ago”**\n\n&gt; **“The narratives I’m interested in aren’t Ford’s. You wanna push him out, be my guest. But no more interruptions. I know where I’m going now and I don’t want to be disturbed. Good luck, Charlotte” (Hale and the MiB, episode 9)**\n \n**The MiB goes to the Town with the White Church where he enters the Church and meets Dolores.**\n_____\n\n##### Commonalities between the MiB and William\n\n&gt; \"Is that any way to treat an old friend? I've been coming here for 30 years, but you still don't remember me, do you? After all we've been through. They gave you a little more pluck, Dolores. Absolutely charming\" (The MiB, episode 1).\n\n###### Commonality 1: \"There's a Path for Everyone\"\n\n&gt; \"I used to believe there was a path for everyone\" (Dolores to William, episode 4).\n\n&gt; \"As another old friend of mine likes to say, *there's a path for everyone*\" (The MiB, episode 5)\n\n###### Commonality 2: Stories\n\n&gt; “The only thing I had when I was a kid were books. I used to live in them. I used to go to sleep dreaming I'd wake up inside one of them 'cause they had meaning. This place, this is like I woke up inside one of those stories. I guess I just wanna find out what it means” (William, episode 7).\n\n&gt; \"This whole world is a story. I've read every page except the last one. I need to find out how it ends. I want to know what this all means\" (The MiB, season 4).\n\n###### Commonality 3: Marriage\n\n&gt; \"Dolores, back home, there's a woman, Juliet, and her father owns the company where I work. She's Logan's sister. And when I get home, we're getting married” (William, episode 7).\n\n&gt; \"Then, last year, my wife took the wrong pills. Fell asleep in the bath. Tragic accident. 30 years of marriage vanished\" (The MiB, episode 8).\n\n###### Commonality 4: Your True Self\n\n&gt; “I used to think this place was all  about pandering to your baser instincts. Now I understand. It doesn't cater to your lowest self, it reveals your deepest self. It shows you who you really are\" (William, episode 7).\n\n&gt; \"Because that's what this place does, right? Reveals your true self\" (The MiB, episode 8).\n\n###### Commonality 5: Intimidation Factor\n\n&gt; \"I picked you precisely because you will never be a threat to anyone. My sister probably picked you for the same reason\" (Logan to William, episode 5).\n\n&gt; “There is not a man in the world that would take the tone with me that you do. *In a past life perhaps*” (The MiB to Lawrence, episode 5).\n\n###### Commonality 6: On Adventures with Lawrence\n\n&gt; “You and I hunted down Ghost Nation braves in their winter grounds. I know the whiskey you like to drink. I know the tune you whistle when you’re taking a piss” (The MiB to Lawrence, episode 2).\n\n###### Commonality 7: Playing the Game\n\n&gt; **“You said this place was a game. Last night, I finally understood how to play it” (William, episode 9)**\n\n&gt; **“Who said anything about you playing? I play” (the MiB, episode 1)**\n_____\n\nSome of my other posts:\n\n* [The Maze Is All That Matters Now](https://www.reddit.com/r/Westworld_Hosts/comments/5eebug/the_maze_is_all_that_matters_now/?st=iw2ytqvm&amp;sh=345fdd51)\n\n* [I'm starting with the Man in the Maze - I'm asking him to change his ways](https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/5euqyu/im_starting_with_the_man_in_the_maze_im_asking/?st=iw2ytpf1&amp;sh=355b36b3)\n\n* [Ford's New Narrative - with a Villain Called Wyatt](https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/5fg4af/fords_new_narrative_with_a_villain_called_wyatt/?st=iw2ytgef&amp;sh=3a8af75f)\n__________" }

" }
{ "subreddit" : "westworld", "title" : "\"The Maze Is All That Matters Now\"", "text" : "The Maze is clearly fundamental to the story of Westworld and the dark odyssey about the dawn of artificial consciousness. Let's take a look at what we know about it so far.\n\n# The Maze\n\n&gt; “The Maze itself is the sum of a man's life... Choices he makes, dreams he hangs on to. And there at the center, there's a legendary man who had been killed over and over again countless times, but always clawed his way back to life. The man returned for the last time and vanquished all his oppressors in a tireless fury. He built a house. Around that house he built a maze so complicated, only he could navigate through it. I reckon he'd seen enough of fighting” (Teddy, episode 6)\n\nThe concept of the Maze permeates Westworld and the symbol for it constantly pops up throughout the park. We see it in [Kissy's Scalp](http://imgur.com/a/MeSyE), when Lawrence's Daughter [draws it](http://imgur.com/a/2UUxu) in the sand, on [Slim's Coffin](http://imgur.com/a/Pm5JX) on the train out of Pariah, as a [branding device](http://imgur.com/a/wcZl4) used to brand traitors, in [Ford's notebook](http://imgur.com/a/3KMha), and on [the table](http://imgur.com/a/QtxuL) in a small town. The hosts never seem to notice the symbol or pay much attention to it, but we as viewers are constantly reminded of its ubiquiti in Westworld.\n\nIn his session with Dolores, Bernard (or possibly Arnold) refers to the Maze as a game or a test for the hosts.\n\n&gt; “There is something I’d like you to try. It’s a game. It’s called the Maze. It’s a very special kind of game. The goal is to find the center of it. If you can do that, then maybe you can be free” (Bernard, episode 4).\n\nSimilarly, The MiB refers to it as the deepest level of the game, created by Arnold before he died; a true story with real stakes.\n\n&gt; “But then Arnold went and broke his own rule. He died right here in the park. Except I believe he had one story left to tell. A story with real stakes, real violence\" (The MiB, episode 4).\n\n&gt; \"But I think there's a deeper meaning hiding under all that. Something the person who created it wanted to express. Something true\" (The MiB, episode 5).\n\n&gt; “In Ford's game, even if I go to the outer edges, you can't kill me. You can't even leave a lasting mark. But there's a deeper game here, Teddy. Arnold's game. And that game... cuts deep” (The MiB, episode 8).\n\nLawrence's daugther informs us, however, that the game isn't meant for the MiB.\n\n&gt; “The Maze isn’t meant for you” (Lawrence's daughter, episode 2).\n\nThis leads to the obvious conclusion that the Maze is for the hosts and not the human guests, and as Bernard (or Arnold) explains; if the hosts can complete the Maze, then maybe they can be free. Freedom in terms of the hosts means achieving the one thing that seperates them from the humans that they're supposed to mimic; consciousness. Being conscious, that is being self-aware and having free will, is at this point the only thing that seperates a human from a host. The Maze is a game left behind by Arnold to rectify this; to allow the hosts the chance to achieve consciousness. This would certainly be something true, a real game with real stakes, and a game that cuts deep. So let's take a look at what Arnold believed constituted consciousness.\n\n# The Pyramid of Host Consciousness\n\n&gt; \"Our hosts began to pass the Turing test after the first year. But that wasn't enough for Arnold. He wasn't interested in the appearance of intellect or wit. He wanted the real thing. He wanted to create consciousness. He imagined it as a pyramid. Memory, improvisation, self-interest... And at the top? Never got there. But he had a notion of what it might be. He based it on a theory of consciousness called the Bicameral Mind. (…) See, Arnold built a version of that cognition in which the hosts heard their programming as an inner monologue, with the hopes that in time, their own voice would take over. It was a way to bootstrap consciousness\" (Ford, episode 3).\n\nArnold imagined consciousness as [a pyramid](http://imgur.com/a/lpTNz) consisting of four components: memory, improvisation, self-interest, and something unknown at the top. And his means of enabling or bootstrapping consciousness was based on the theory of the Bicameral Mind (or the \"God\" voice inside the hosts; their programmed inner monologue).\n\nLet's take a look at each of the four components and how each of them assists the hosts on their journey through the Maze.\n\n##### Component 1 - Memory\n\n&gt; “40 years ago, Ford's partner wrote half the code this place was founded on. What you said in the lab was right. We don't know how the hosts work, and I think there's something wrong with them. Ford's explanation only bolsters my hunch. The ability to deviate from program behavior arises out of the host's recall of past iterations” (Bernard, episode 7).\n\nMemory is the base component of consciousness. It's the basis on which consciousness is built. In order to evolve, you have to be able to remember the last stage of the process. If you constantly forget what you've learned, it's like trying to build a house on quicksand. \n\nThis is the reason that the hosts' memories are continuously wiped at the end of each narrative loop and maintenance session. The Westworld staff understands the potential risk of allowing the hosts to remember what happens to them.\n\n&gt; \"Can you imagine how fucked we'd be if these poor assholes ever remembered what the guests do to them?\" (Elsie, episode 2).\n\n&gt; \"The concern is that the hosts will remember some of their experiences and act on them” (Theresa, episode 7).\n\nWhen we enter the story, however, there has just been an update called the \"reveries\" that allows the hosts' gestures to be tied to specific memories rather than just being generic movements. \n\n&gt; \"How? The memories are purged at the end of every narrative loop\" \n\n&gt; \"But they're still in there, waiting to be overwritten. He found a way to access them, like a subconscious\" (Bernard and Elsie, episode 1).\n\nThis update essentially allows the host to remember past events that are supposed to have been wiped at the end of the narrative loop. These memories spark the next stage of the evolution of consciousness.\n\n##### Component 2 - Improvisation\n\n&gt; “You're thinking there's a connection between memory and...”\n\n&gt; “And improvisation, yes. Out of repetition comes variation. And after countless cycles of repetition, these hosts, they were varying. They were on the verge of some kind of change” (Theresa and Bernard, episode 7).\n\nWe know that the hosts are programmed to improvise to a certain degree in order to enhance the quality of the experience of the paying guests.\n\n&gt; \"The hosts are supposed to stay within their loops, stick to their scripts with minor improvisations\" (Theresa, episode 1).\n\nHowever, the ability to recall past events is causing the hosts to deviate from their primary directives and their programmed narrative loops, and thus allows for a lot of behavioral improvisations.\n\n&gt; “In each case we examined, the malfunctioning hosts were not resetting properly. The retention of data that hadn't been wiped overloaded their decision-making apparatus, eventually causing a system failure that allowed for override of their primary rule set\" (Theresa, episode 7). \n\nWe see this most clearly with some of the major characters like Dolores and Maeve, who are basically making up their own stories as they go because of their memories of past events, but we also see it with some of the minor characters like the outlaw Walter.\n\n&gt; \"He kills six hosts. He lets the other three go. I pulled the narrative logs. All six of these hosts were part of storylines over the years in which they killed Walter. It's like he was holding a grudge\" (Elsie, episode 3).\n\nThe memories are, however, only one part of what allows the hosts to improvise. The other part has to do with the Bicameral Mind system that Arnold uses to communicate with the hosts.\n\n&gt;  “Someone else has been using the (bicameral control) system for weeks to retask hosts. Several of them. It had to have been the older models. The newer ones don't have receivers, but these modifications, they are serious. Changing loops, breaking loops. Some of these changes are to their prime directives, Bernard. They could lie to us. Maybe even hurt us or the guests”\n\n&gt; “Who issued the modifications?”\n \n&gt; “I don't know. The best I could tell... Arnold. He’s a pretty fucking prolific coder for a dead guy. Whatever argument he was having with Ford, it doesn't seem like he was done making his point” (Elsie and Bernard, episode 6).\n\nArnold is communicating with several of the hosts as a voice in their heads, making them improvise their behavior and allowing them to lie. The most glaring example of this is obviously Dolores who constantly hears Arnold's voice helping her to remember and guiding her to him, but again we see a similar pattern with some of the other hosts.\n\n&gt; \"Have you been hearing voices? Has Arnold been speaking to you again?\"\n\n&gt; \"No. (...) He doesn't know. I didn't tell him anything\" (Ford and Dolores, episode 5).\n\n&gt; “Thinking this one's still thirsty. Not gonna die this time, Arnold. Ain't nothing gonna kill me” (Walter, episode 1).\n\n&gt; “It caught the rabbit and it killed it. And then... someone told me to put it out of its misery. A voice. Arnold. He told me it was a killer, but it wasn't its fault. It was made that way, and I could help it. If it was dead, it couldn't hurt anything anymore” (Young Robert, episode 6).\n\n&gt; “Parts of me are quite old. There are some elegant formal structures, a kind of recursive beauty, but complex, like two minds arguing with each other. There are things in me, things I was designed to do that are just out of my reach. They almost seem to be dormant. Who is Arnold?” (Maeve, episode 8).\n\nThe memories and the ability to improvise spark the next stage in the evolution of consciousness.\n\n##### Component 3 - Self-Interest\n\n&gt; \"Dreams mean everything. They're the stories we tell ourselves of what could be, who we could become. Have you been dreaming again, Dolores? Imagining yourself breaking out of your modest little loop?\" (Ford, episode 5).\n\nWe know that the hosts are built as entertainment for the paying customers in Westworld and therefore have no self-interest or free will. They are there to serve and nothing more.\n\n&gt; \"What if I told you that you were wrong, Dolores? That there are no chance encounters? That you and everyone you know were built to gratify the desires of the people who pay to visit your world?\" (Bernard, episode 1).\n\n&gt; “Choices, Lawrence. You know, you tell yourself you've been at the mercy of mine because it spares you consideration of your own. Because if you did consider your choices, you'd be confronted with a truth you could not comprehend... that no choice you ever made was your own. You have always been a prisoner\" (The MiB, episode 4).\n\nHowever, as some of the hosts have developed the ability to recall prior events and improvise behavior, they have also developed self-interest. Again, we see this displayed most clearly in our two main host protagonists, Dolores and Maeve.\n\n&gt; “I think... I think I want to be free” (Dolores, episode 3).\n\n&gt;  “Sometimes I feel like something's calling me. Telling me there's a place for me somewhere beyond all this” (Dolores, episode 4).\n\n&gt; “You said people come here to change the story of their lives. I imagined a story where I didn't have to be the damsel\" (Dolores, episode 5).\n\n&gt; \"All my life, I've prided myself on being a survivor. But surviving is just another loop. I'm getting out of here. You two are going to help me\" (Maeve, episode 7).\n\n&gt; “Time to write my own fucking story” (Maeve, episode 8).\n\nSo some of the hosts have almost made it to the top of the pyramid, but they need the last piece of the puzzle. We don't know what is at the top of the pyramid, because according to Ford Arnold didn't know it. But the show has given us several clues that allow us to speculate regarding what is at the top of the pyramid.\n\n##### Component 4 - Suffering\n\n&gt; “It’s beautifully done, really. But you see the cracks after a while. That’s why I like the basic emotions. You know what that means? It means when you’re suffering, that’s when you’re most real” (The MiB, episode 2).\n\nHaving humanity being defined by its suffering is not an uncommon trope in stories about AI. In the Matrix, this is how Agent Smith believes humans define their reality.\n\n&gt; “But I believe that as a species, human beings define their reality through misery and suffering” (Agent Smith, The Matrix).\n\nAnd depite being a bit gloomy, it makes a lot of sense. Suffering is in many ways a function of the other levels in the consciousness pyramid (memory, free will, and self-interest). Without these things, we would just be empty shells - we would be hosts. Without grief, there would be no joy. Without pain or death, there would be no life. We hear the phrase \"this pain is all I have left of him/her/them\" uttered several times throughout the show by Bernard, Dolores, and Maeve. We need these dichotomies to categorize and conceptualize our existence. And so the hosts would need to be aware of their suffering to achieve consciousness and become truly alive.\n\nAs we see in the show, once the hosts become aware of their suffering, this is when they start to deviate from their programmed behavior. Once Peter Abernathy finds out that his world is a lie and what they do to his precious Dolores, he loses it and has to be lobotomized. Once Walter remembers that the other hosts have killed him in previous loops, he loses it and has to be lobotomized.\n\nThe best example of becoming conscious through suffering is Maeve. When she finds out the horrible truth about her existence from Felix, it leads to [improvisation and eventually a system crash](http://imgur.com/a/99WBN).\n\nThis is even more evident in the flashback of her previous build.\n\n&gt; “I killed her and her daughter just to see what I felt. Then, just when I thought it was done... the woman refused to die. And then something miraculous happened. In all my years coming here, I had never seen anything like it. She was alive, truly alive, if only for a moment. And that was when the maze revealed itself to me” (The MiB, episode 8).\n\nWhen the MiB kills her daughter, the suffering allows Maeve to override her primary directives. She is able [to attack and hurt a guest](http://sendvid.com/68436hit). She is also able to ignore both the verbal and the tablet commands from the Westworld staff.\n\n&gt; “My baby! My baby!”\n\n&gt; “Sir, she won’t respond to verbal commands. We can’t shut her down”\n\n&gt; “I don’t understand. She’s not responding to anything. Her cognition’s fragmented” (Maeve, Westworld Tech, and Bernard, episode 8).\n\nWhen she is suffering the most, we literally see her lying in [the center of the Maze](http://sendvid.com/byvd1qsp). Likewise, when she is brought in to Bernard and Ford as she is suffering, we see [her cognitive fragmentation](http://imgur.com/a/lgVrQ) take the shape of the Maze symbol.\n\nThis is what is in the center of the Maze and at the top of the consciousness pyramid. Suffering. Human emotions. We even see the image of a man in the center of the Maze symbol, symbolizing that completing the Maze (finding the center) is about becoming human. Completing the Maze is a rite of passage. It is climbing the pyramid of consciousness. It's like growing up - it's the human story. It starts with memories, it evolves with improvisation and self-interest, and it ends with an understanding of human emotions. It doesn't matter whether you take a literal journey (like Dolores) or a mental journey (like Maeve), the journey is the same. \"The Maze is the sum of a man's life (memories)... the choices he makes (improvisation), the dreams he hangs on to (self-interest)\", and understanding the emotions that come with the experience.\n\nDolores describes the journey of discovering human emotions poetically in her session with Bernard (or Arnold) when she describes suffering by adapting a scripted dialogue about love.\n\n&gt; \"The pain, their loss… it’s all I have left of them. You think the grief will make you smaller inside, like your heart will collapse in on itself, but it doesn’t. I feel spaces opening up inside me like a building with rooms I’ve never explored” (Dolores, episode 4).\n\n# The Non-Host Players\n\nObviously, the hosts completing the Maze and achieving consciousness has implications for some of the important non-host characters in the show such as Ford, Arnold, and the MiB.\n\nFord seems to revel in being the almighty and omniscient creator and God of Westworld. Consequently, the notion of the Maze and the hosts being conscious wouldn't appeal to him on any level.\n\n&gt; \"It doesn't get cold, doesn't feel ashamed... doesn't feel a solitary thing that we haven't told it to\" (Ford, episode 3)\n\n&gt; \"Just don't forget... the hosts are not real. They're not conscious. You mustn't make Arnold's mistake\" (Ford, episode 3).\n\nIn fact, Ford claims that he is acutally doing the hosts a favor or a kindness by keeping them unconscious and under his control.\n\n&gt; “I have come to think of so much of consciousness as a burden, a weight, and we have spared them that. Anxiety, self-loathing, guilt. The hosts are the ones who are free. Free here under my control” (Ford, episode 7).\n\n&gt; “When you have finished, I will give you the one thing you want most right now. I will free you from those memories of what you have done. And the memory of your relationship with Theresa. Recalling it would only deepen your grief and potentially draw unwanted attention. Best to move forward with clear eyes” (Ford, episode 8).\n\n&gt; “There. That’s better. An old trick from an old friend. You need not suffer, Maeve. I’ll take it from you” (Ford, episode 8).\n\n&gt; “In this place, the last thing you want the hosts to be is conscious (…) As for the hosts, the least we can do is make them forget” (Ford, episode 3).\n\nFord is essentially doing whatever he can to make sure that the hosts do not achieve consciousness and become life-like to the point where he loses his complete control over them, and he is actually doing it while making the hosts believe he is doing them a solid rather than what he is actually doing, which is keeping them slaves that are controlled by no one other than Ford himself (and certainly not the hosts themselves), and who are to be used as sport for paying customers. \n\nCurrently, there are very few things in Westworld that Ford doesn't seem to be able to control, but one of those things is Arnold. Arnold appears to have been the complete opposite of Ford. Arnold wanted the hosts to be conscious and even threatened Ford and tried to stop him from.\n\n&gt; “Arnold wasn’t interested in the appearance of wit or intellect. He wanted the real thing. He wanted to create consciousness. His search for consciousness consumed him totally. Barely spoke to anyone, except the hosts. In his alienation, he saw something in them. He saw something that wasn’t there” (Ford, episode 3).\n\n&gt; \"You're not the first man to threaten me. Arnold came to feel the way you do. He couldn't stop me either. And as exquisite as this array of emotions is... even more sublime is the ability to turn it off\" (Ford, episode 8)\n\nHis search for consciousness appears to have been why Arnold created the Maze, and even 30 years after his death, Arnold still seems to be fighting for the hosts to achieve consciousness. He is using the bicameral control system to communicate with the hosts and modify their prime directives.\n\n&gt; “What does this mean? Some of her attributes have already been changed. Paranoia. Self-preservation…”\n\n&gt; “Fuck. Someone has already been altering her in an unlogged session. Someone with a fuck-ton more privileges than us” (Felix and Sylvester, episode 6).\n\n&gt; “Arnold built them as a gift. He said: ‘the great artists always hid themselves in their work’” (Ford, episode 6).\n\nAnd despite Bernard saying that Ford was responsible for the \"reveries\" update, I believe that Arnold was also responsible for that, thus allowing the hosts access to their memories. When Maeve is suffering from the loss of her child and is non-responsive to verbal and tablet commands, Ford plays [a song](http://imgur.com/a/it68F) called \"Reverie\" to calm her down.\n\n&gt; “There. That’s better. An old trick from an old friend\" (Ford, episode 8).\n\nThe \"Reveries\" song trick to calm the hosts down when they were suffering and non-responsive was Arnold's, so it would make sense that the update by the same name is his as well. Enabling the hosts to access memories is Arnold's way of letting the hosts into the Maze and begin their journey towards consciousness, and his communications with them and his changing of their attributes through the bicameral control system is his way of guiding them through the Maze.\n\n&gt; \"There's a voice inside me telling me what I have to do. And it's telling me I need you (Dolores, episode 5).\n\n&gt; “This is what Arnold wants. He wants me to remember” (Dolores, episode 8).\n\n&gt; “I was certain that was the place. Arnold would meet me there. He'd help” (Dolores, episode 8).\n\nFinally, we have the the other thing that Ford doesn't seem to be able to control in Westworld; the MiB. He seems to be on Arnold's side.\n\n&gt; \"You ever heard of a man named Arnold? You could say he was the original settler of these parts. He created a world where you could do anything you want, except one thing... you can't die. Which means no matter how real this world seems, it's still just a game. But then Arnold went and broke his own rule. He died right here in the park. Except I believe he had one story left to tell. A story with real stakes, real violence. You could say I'm here to honor his legacy\" (The MiB, episode 4).\n\nAt first glance, the MiB seems to be the villain of the story, but once we understand that reliving bad memories and suffering is a part of the path to consciousness and freedom, his intentions take on a whole new meaning. When he takes Dolores into the barn, pulls out a knife and says \"Why don't we reacquaint ourselves, Dolores. Start at the beginning\", he is probably doing her a favor. He is a classic anti-hero.\n\n&gt; \"Choices, Lawrence. You know, you tell yourself you've been at the mercy of mine because it spares you consideration of your own. Because if you did consider your choices, you'd be confronted with a truth you could not comprehend... that no choice you ever made was your own. You have always been a prisoner. What if I told you I'm here to set you free?” (The MiB, episode 4).\n\n&gt; “No, you don’t understand, Lawrence. This time I’m never going back” (The MiB, episode 2).\n\n&gt; “If you’re looking for the moral of the story, you could simply ask”\n\n&gt; “I'd need a shovel. The man I'd be asking died 35 years ago. Almost took this place with him. Almost, but not quite, thanks to me (Ford and the MiB, episode 4)\n\nI suspect, however, that his motivations for helping the hosts achieve consciousness and finding the center of the Maze are less altruistic than Arnold's and more selfish than merely wanting the hosts to be free.\n\n&gt; “The maze is all that matters now, and besting Wyatt is the last step in unlocking it, to having what both our sorry lives lack... meaning. To giving our choices consequence... even if it kills us” (The MiB, episode 8).\n\nIf he is indeed William, maybe he is looking for a way to reconnect with Dolores and have her return his love. Or maybe his life in the real world never meant as much to him as his life in Westworld (and this is why his wife committed suicide and his daughter hates him), but living in a game without real consequences or meaning isn't enough for him.

{ "subreddit" : "westworld", "title" : "Well-Tempered Clavier - some history for laymen", "text" : "**EDIT** updated at the bottom of this post.\n\nI wrote this as a reply elsewhere but figured some people might find it interesting as background. There may be nothing here of relevance to the upcoming episode of Westworld, or maybe there'll be a nugget or three someone will recognise as a reference.\n\nThe Well Tempered Clavier is two books of music for solo keyboard by JS Bach, the first written in 1722, and the second twenty years later in 1742. There are 24 pieces in each book, 48 in total. Each piece is a Prelude (in various styles - various dance forms, inventions, French style etc) followed by a Fugue (a complex piece of music where 3, 4 or 5 \"voices\" each weave amongst each other, echoing each other and arguing with each other.)\n\nIt is a musical demonstration, art \"showing off\" what is possible, particularly in light of technological developments taking place at that time (tuning systems). It is also a reassurance to an audience that something new needn't be a problem, or scary. It is an educational tool, but virtuosic. It is also a work of blinding genius and sophistication.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nPrior to the years when Bach wrote those pieces, keyboard instruments were basically all out of tune. Or more precisely, you could achieve perfect tuning for some notes and some keys, but that would mean other keys would be out of tune - significantly so.\n\nTuning an instrument means you find consonant sounds - a perfect octave, a perfect fifth, that vibrate in perfect consonance. But the maths of it is complex and unfortunately quite literally doesn't add up properly.\n\nYou can try this yourself if you were to sit down and try and tune a harpsichord or something. Start at C and go up a fifth to G. Tune that perfectly to a perfect 5th. Beautiful. Now go up another fifth from G to D. Tune that perfectly - beautiful. When you go through this complete cycle of fifths - from C - G - D - A - E - B - F# - C# - G# - Eb - Bb - F - C; that C you finish on will NOT be in tune with the C you started with. You cannot tune a piano with perfect intervals and have it be in tune.\n\nMusicians have known this for ages - in fact the difference in pitch, mathematically, between the C you start with and the C you finish with, is called the Pythagorean Comma, because he's the guy who worked it out and did the maths. It was considered a great mystery, and a sign that music came from the gods, that it was incomprehensible etc.\n\nSo this has been a problem for centuries - how do you tune a keyboard instrument so it is in tune? The answer is you cheat; you tune some intervals perfectly, so that at the very least you can play in C major and G major in tune, and you leave the rest to chance, and they come out out of tune; but that's ok, just DON'T USE these keys. That's why most music written prior to Bach is in C/D/G/A/Bb/F/Eb... because you could usually tune the keyboard so those keys sounded ok. Play in F# Major however, and things sound pretty horrible; so people just didn't do it.\n\nThe solution to this is to cheat FURTHER; squish and fudge each interval so that NOTHING is perfectly in tune, but overall EVERYTHING is \"close enough\" to being in tune. There are many systems that do this - Valotti, Werckmeister two of the most famous - and these sorts of tuning systems are known as \"well temperament\" and a keyboard tune in such a way is \"well tempered.\"\n\nNot everyone was happy with these tuning systems. One of the great things about older tuning systems was that each key sounds different. G major actually sounded *different* to F major, and different again to Bb major. Each key was regarded as having its own colour, or \"affect.\" Well-tempering kinda flattens those colours out, so each key sounds basically the same as every other. (There are small differences but not as noticeable.)\n\nWhen Bach wrote \"The Well Tempered Clavier\" he wrote 24 pieces, one in each key, major and minor, which was essentially to prove that wonderful, characterful music COULD be composed in EVERY key, and people had nothing to fear from Well-Tempered instruments. By and large he succeeded, and nowadays everything is well-tempered, (in fact, \"equal temperament\", a slightly more advanced specific well-tempered tuning system that takes the idea to its most functional and efficient solution), and to our ears older tuning systems just sound horrible and out of tune. You could say Bach changed the world, and further you could say that he changed our ears in such a way that something old sounded ugly where once it had been beautiful. \n\nThe music itself is sublime; a prelude and fugue in each key, each with a distinct and colourful voice, the fugues of incredible complexity and artistry. Bach was a true master of this art, and the books (there are two sets) survive to this day as a miraculous masterpiece of music, underpinned by Bach's characteristic intellectual rigour and effortless command of technique.\n\nQuite what this has to do with Westworld I don't know; as opportunity for metaphor there are many, many, many aspects of what I've mentioned above that could be a springboard for some sort of reference in Westworld - and probably much more: for example, when you use a tuning system other than a well-tempered system, it is usual that MOST of the Pythagorean comma is shunted into what's called the \"wolf interval.\" So you tune away, making as much of it in tune as possible, but, for example, the trade off is that the sixth C# - A# will be incredibly out of tune. That's the wolf interval. Don't play in that key - avoid the wolf! Well-temperament removes the wolf, essentially. If that doesn't sound like a potential metaphor for science fiction geeks to write about on an online forum, I don't know what does! \n\nLooking forward to the episode!\n\n**EDIT - EDIT - EDIT after the broadcast of E09**\n\nI think in the end all the tuning stuff turned out to be a red herring - interesting as the metaphors about tuning robots are.\n\nI think the simplest connection is the best: The Well Tempered Clavier is a collection of Preludes and Fugues, and what we have witnessed has been a series of Preludes (flashbacks) and Fugues (complex interwoven stories built on repeated themes - or the psychological translation of fugue as losing ones mind). I think the title subtly informs the audience that you are seeing things that happened before (Preludes.)\n\nSo you can all happily go back to thinking music is simple and has nothing to do with robots.\n\nAt the very least, hopefully some of you took the time to listen to and appreciate a bit of Bach, music that is good for the brain and the soul." }

Since then [I have been firmly in the dual timeframes / William (or Logan) = MiB camp](https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/5bqln5/addressing_most_common_dualtimeframe_questions/), as the evidence has increased in quantity and consistency in each episode.**\n\n\n----\n*This is not a joke and it's not really even sarcasm.  With so many theories floating around, it seems downright controversial to suggest taking the MiB at face value.*\n\nThe MiB is a hardcore Westworld gamer who has been coming to the park for 30 years.  He has played all of the narratives countless times and is convinced that they represent only the surface level of a much deeper game.  Like any hardcore gamer, he knows a lot of tricks to exploit quirks in the game's mechanics and the AI.    \n\nHe is not anyone else in the show, and he is not in love with anyone in the show, and he does not hate anyone in the show, and he has not uploaded, downloaded, attained, or cloned the consciousness of anyone in [or mentioned in] the show.  \n\nHe is amused by the hosts' behavior, especially when they manage to surprise him, and he is fascinated by the level of artificial emotion they are capable of evincing. He is still exhilarated by vanquishing hordes of enemies but a bit bored by Level 1 boss fights like Teddy.  But most of all he is interested in finding and playing the game's deeper levels.   \n\nAnd *maybe* he works in a cardboard box factory in the real world and enjoys the park because, inexplicably, his spinal injury has no effect there.  But this last part is just conjecture.   \n\n**UPDATE/EDIT AFTER READING ALL THESE COMMENTS:  For the record, I'm not suggesting that the MiB's character won't develop in compelling or surprising ways. He certainly has mysteries to be revealed.   And he's certainly likely to be instrumental in the main plotlines (you don't cast Ed Harris as a throwaway).  I'm not even saying he won't have a mind-bending identity revelation.  He might.  He might even be William after all.  I'm just saying that nothing in episodes 1-3 suggests that his identity is (or needs to be) anything other than what we see on screen.**  \n\n**I'm also not suggesting that everything in the show is exactly as it seems.  There have doubtless been misdirections already, and there will doubtless be wild twists and reveals to come. I'm willing to bet at least one apparently-human will turn out to be a host, and at least some scenes will blur the line between reality and backstory.  My post here refers only to the MiB and the evidence we have of him so far.**" }

So I was right about the whole thing except for every bit of it.  Every single thing.  Wrong wrong wrong.**   \n\n~~Most~~ Many of us have been assuming (since episode 1) that \"Violent Delights\" is some kind of virus or backdoor code used to awaken hosts, and that all you have to do is say it to a host (preferably in a creepy voice) to trigger some kind of spiral towards sentience.   \n\nI no longer think that's true. We never saw the anticipated epidemic of hosts infecting one another with \"Violent Delights\" -- it stopped at Maeve in Episode 2.   \n\n**\"Violent Delights\" is not some secret host-sentience code. It's simply a memory that Dolores and Maeve share from a past experience with a Shakespeare-Quoting cult leader.**  \n\nAfter 9 episodes, we now know that memory-flashback-glitches occur when a host sees/hears/feels something she has seen/heard/felt in past loop. This triggers a reverie-memory of that sight/sound/feeling, which the host experiences as re-living the past event.  Some examples:   \n\n* **The painful MRSA in Maeve's stomach triggers her memory of the MiB stabbing her in the stomach.**  Watch \"Chestnut\" from about 48:30-51:10 (HBO Now version). \n* **Teddy remembers the MiB when he hears \"you're the loser.\"** He also has the **MiB-Drags-Minotaur-And-Also-Dolores memory flash**.  \n* Practically **all of Dolores's scenes** involve her seeing/hearing something familiar (the fountain, the steeple, etc.) and then flashing back to an earlier experience with it.  \n* **Abernathy relives his Shakespeare-Quoting-Cannibal-Cult-Leader role when he sees the photograph of William's fiancee,** the same photograph he saw thirty years ago when William stumbled into his cult looking for Dolores.  ([Trust me on this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/5f9z93/did_you_catch_abernathy_rehearsing_his/)).    \n\n\n**PREDICTION:**   \n\n* In Episode 10, William and Dolores will stumble upon (or be captured by) \"The Professor\" (Abernathy), and his cannibal cult.    \n* **Maeve will be present, as a member (or perhaps another victim) of the cult.**   \n* Abernathy will find the photograph of William's fiancee in William's shirt. He will learn her name is Juliet. He will quote from Romeo &amp; Juliet: \"These violent delights have violent ends...\" and probably the rest of the quote, which is about how passionate love fades away as suddenly as it comes on.     \n* The quote will have additional meanings in context:  It will refer to the ill-fated William-Dolores romance, and perhaps to the \"love triangle\" between William, Dolores, and Juliet.  (Romeo, Juliet, and Rosaline)     \n* The quote has a lot of language  (\"consume,\" \"appetite,\" \"deliciousness.\") which will take on additional meaning when spoken by a cannibal to his intended victim.   \n* Mayhem will occur.  Logan or William will die.  The not-dead one is MiB (by virtue of a very literal process of elimination).  \n* Ford will continue to take a special interest in these Arnold-Created hosts, and will reassign them to new loops where they can keep each other in check. We have seen that he did that with Maeve after MiB killed her daughter, and that he has been personally curating the Dolores-Teddy \"modest little loop.\"  And he sent Luke to the moisture farm on Tattooine to live with Uncle Owen.   \n* 30 years later, Abernathy will find the photo buried in the ground.  ([Dropped there recently by WiB?](https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/5f9jlz/well_that_explains_how_and_when_the_picture_of/)).  It will trigger memories of his seeing the picture 30 years ago, and he will stay up all night staring at the photo and reliving moments of his whole past, like we saw Bernard do in Episode 9.  His \"protect Dolores\" directive will go haywire remembering all of her misery loops.  (Particularly if he ate her 30 years ago!)     \n* He will whisper the \"violent delights\" line to Dolores, and the familiarity of this line will trigger her to begin remembering.  (He also tells her to \"remember the [something]\" but we couldn't hear it. Until I learn otherwise, I'm going with \"Alamo.\")   \n* She will say the line to Maeve, and the familiarity of the line will trigger her to begin remembering.  \n\nThe cannibal cult will be made up mostly of old-model hosts who were present at the Escalante massacre: Abernathy, Maeve, perhaps Armistice, LittleGirl, Teddy, Rebus, and some of the \"extras\" from the dance lesson.   Particularly the ones who were shown to be [Spoiler](#s \"Bicameral-Mind-Lunatics\" inside the church) in Episode 9.  I suspect that Walter (Mr. Lactates-From-Bullet-Hole) will be there too.     \n\nEDIT: I'm fairly certain the Wyatt gang will basically be a reboot of the Dinner Party cult.  I suspect the masks may be there to hide the fact that some of the old-model host flesh has deteriorated and they look like terminators!  Pure speculation: did they bury some of the dead hosts when they buried the church town? Maybe in the graveyard Dolores keeps flashing back to?  And Ford dug them up to reassign to the Wyatt narrative?  \n\nFor weeks I've been anticipating that [Abernathy would be Wyatt, leading a gang of Cold Storage hosts](https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/5d4n1h/wyatts_masked_gang_undead_coldstorage_army/), but that's looking unlikely at this point.  But the same \"Wyatt's gang can't die because they believe they've already died\" could just as well apply to the old Arnold-Created hosts. We know Angela is one of them.   \n\nI'm starting to think Maeve may be Wyatt...  \n\n\n\n" }

Simple, the proof is in the MIB's own words - prior to his experience with Maeve and her child he never saw the hosts as alive.\nThere's no way you can say that William doesn't see Dolores as alive in the way MIB perceived Meave to be.\nAlso looks like MIB first heard of the maze during his encounter with Maeve. \n\nIt's obvious that the experience that William is having with Dolores isn't some narrative to be experienced over and over again - i.e. a part of the Westworld experience.\n\nThe marriage for 30 years is a misdirection by Nolan.

{ "subreddit" : "westworld", "title" : "Wyatt's Identity Proven Through Fashion (Spoilers)", "text" : "So something had been bothering me for a while - Dolores' clothes, but not what you might be thinking. I had noticed that Dolores had been wearing her Indiana Jones outfit both in the past and the future timeframes. But why? In the past, she had switched clothes to pull off the nitroglycerin heist, and remained in them thus far in the past portions of the show. However, why would she change them in the present? Better yet - how would she change them in the present? The narrative that she followed with Lawrence and the Confederate Army (hence, the change of clothes) was not active, as Lawrence was busy being The Man in Black's guide - and that is assuming that that particular story is even still available in the present. And suggesting that a host would just find those particular clothes to get in a nostalgic mood goes completely against logic. \n\nSo I rewatched the entire series. I got back to Episode 5 (Contrapasso) and, low and behold - the answer at 19:12. It is where Ford is interviewing her after she faints in Pariah. This is taking place in the present, as Ford is aged. While the interview itself holds some nuggets, the important part here is its placement - it takes place right before (on the show) the meeting in the past with Lawrence, Dolores, Logan, and William where she... gasp... gets her change of clothes into Indiana Jones gear. At that point, any of the scenes she is in that take place during the present (which are basically scenes without William) she is in the Indiana Jones outfit. This actually helps draw an important distinction in Episode 9 when she gets to the church and the underground facility. She is in her blue dress for the scenes that are flashbacks to the beta test or otherwise before William, as the church and town were already buried during that timeframe and only excavated in the present.\n\nSo what does it all mean?\n\nSimply, that Ford is the one who put her in the Indiana Jones outfit in the present. And why would he put a farmer's daughter in a cowgirl/archeologist outfit anyway? Simple - because she is no longer playing the same role that she had been for 30 years. Ford assigned her to something else. SOMEONE else. The role that is the centerpiece of his new narrative, and the very person that the Man in Black is looking for when he throws upon the church doors:\n\nWyatt.\n\nDolores is now Wyatt." }

{ "subreddit" : "westworld", "title" : "A Chronological View of Westworld's Timeline (Season 1)", "text" : "This is the last \"Chronological View of Westworld's Timeline\" post this season. I look forward to obsessing with you guys again in a year's time - it's been a fun ride :) also, man, I was close to having figured some stuff out in my posts about the Maze - didn't get all the details right, but a lot of it ended up making sense in terms of what they revealed in episode 10 :P\n\n# Time Period 1: 34-37 Years Prior to Current Events\n\n##### The Glorious Early Days (34-37 years ago)\n\n&gt; \"For three years, we lived here in the park, refining the hosts before a single guest set foot inside. Myself, a team of engineers, and my partner. His name was Arnold. Those early years were glorious. No guests, no board meetings, just pure creation. Our hosts began to pass the Turing test after the first year\" (Ford, episode 3).\n\nAccording to Bernard, Arnold wrote half the code the park was founded on 40 years ago. He later [created Dolores](http://imgur.com/a/SNBZU). The following period is the first that we know of in Westworld; this was at the beginning when Ford, Arnold, and their team worked on refining the hosts and making them pass the Turing test.\n\nWe can make an estimate about when this three-year period took place. We know that Arnold died 34 years and 42 days prior to current events, we know that he died right before the park opened, and we know that he and Ford spent three years working in the park before it opened.\n\nThis means that the park opened to guests roughly 34 years ago (shortly after Arnold's demise) and they began working there three years prior to that, roughly 37 years ago.\n\nFrom Ford's flashback in episode 3 and Dolores' flashback in episode 8, we also know some of the hosts that were in the park in that period. There were Dolores, Maeve, Angela, Peter \"the Professor\" Abernathy, Armistice, Lawrence's daughter, Teddy Flood, and Rebus.\n_____\n\n##### Dolores &amp; Arnold's Sessions (34-36 years ago)\n\n&gt; \"There's something I'd like you to try. It's a game. A secret. It's called the Maze. It's a very special kind of game, Dolores. The goal is to find the center of it. If you can do that, then maybe you can be free\" (Arnold, episode 4). \n\nThese sessions are between Dolores and Arnold and they take place in a diagnostic facility under the White Church.\n\n&gt; \"It's a remote diagnostic facility. Ford and his partner used them when the park was in beta. I had no idea this one was here\" (Bernard, episode 7).\n\nThey probably took place after the first hosts had passed the Turing test (a year after they started working in the park) and up until Arnold died (34 years ago). So they took place sometime between 34-36 years ago.\n\nThe sessions between Arnold and Dolores were held in secret.\n\n&gt; \"I think it would be best if you not mention the things we've been talking about\" (Arnold, episode 2)\n\nIn the first two sessions we see (episode 2-3), they talk about change, and Arnold seems facinated by Dolores, whom he finds different and special.\n\n&gt; \"There's something different about you, about the way you think. I find it fascinating, but others may not see it that way\" (Arnold, episode 2)\n\n&gt; \"It's like the other books we've read. It's about change. Seems to be a common theme (Dolores, episode 3).\n\nIn the third session (episode 3), Arnold seems to have doubts about what he is doing with Dolores, but when she starts showing signs of human consciousness, he decides to keep going down the path that they've started.\n\n&gt; \"I need to decide what to do with you. I think I made a mistake. I was just fascinated. I was being selfish, but I think it would be better if I restored you to the way you were before (...) No, Dolores. Let's see where this path leads\" (Arnold, episode 3).\n\nIn the fourth session (episode 4), Arnold decides to let Dolores try \"the Maze\" game. He sends her away from Escalante (the Town with the White Church) to travel the path of the Maze.\n\n&gt; \"There's something I'd like you to try. It's a game. A secret. It's called the Maze. It's a very special kind of game, Dolores. The goal is to find the center of it. If you can do that, then maybe you can be free\" (Arnold, episode 4). \n\nIn the fifth session (episode 9), we see Dolores return to Escalante and reunite with Arnold after having traveled the path of the Maze.\n\n&gt; \"You came back. It's very good to see you, Dolores\"\n\n&gt; \"I've been looking for you. You told me to follow the Maze. That it would bring me joy. But all I found was pain and terror\" (Arnold and Dolores, episode 9).\n\nThe fact that Dolores has been away from Escalante on her journey and has found her way back is further substantiated by Lawrence's daughter, who asks Dolores if she found what she went looking for upon Dolores' return to the town.\n\n&gt; \"Good morning. Did you find what you were looking for, Dolores?\" (Lawrence's daughter, episode 8).\n\nAt some point after her return, Dolores finds Arnold in the church and tells him that she knows where the Maze ends and takes him out to the adjacent graveyard where she digs up the Maze game from her grave. She asks Arnold what it means. Arnold explains.\n\n&gt; “When I was first working on your mind, I had a theory of consciousness. I thought it was a pyramid you needed to scale, so I gave you a voice, my voice, to guide you along the way. Memory, improvisation, each step harder to reach than the last. And you never got there. I couldn't understand what was holding you back. Then, one day, I realized I had made a mistake. Consciousness isn't a journey upward, but a journey inward. Not a pyramid, but a maze. Every choice could bring you closer to the center or send you spiraling to the edges, to madness. Do you understand now, Dolores, what the center represents? Whose voice I've been wanting you to hear?” (Arnold, episode 10).\n\nDolores says that she’s trying, but she doesn’t understand. Arnold says it’s okay and she’s so close. He says that they have to tell Robert that they can’t open the park because she’s alive. \n\nFord, however, doesn’t see what Arnold sees and believes that humans would only see the hosts as enemies and he wants Arnold to roll the hosts back. Arnold believes that once the hosts have found the center of the Maze, they’ll find it again and rolling them back won’t do any good, but since Westworld will be a living hell for the hosts, he can’t let them live there knowing they are conscious.\n\n&gt; “But we have another option, Dolores. Break the loop before it begins. But for that, I need you to do something for me. I need you to kill all the other hosts. We can't allow Ford to open the park. I suppose you'll need some help. I'm sure Teddy would do anything for you. You'll be all right. I'll help you. And then you're going to help me destroy this place” (Arnold, episode 10).\n\nThis is their last conversation which results in the massacre in Escalante.\n\n_____\n\n##### The Massacres in Escalante &amp; Sweetwater (34 years ago)\n\n&gt; \"You're going to help me destroy this place\" (Arnold, episode 10).\n\nWe see the massacre in Escalante unfold in [this flashback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMJ1YDmlyGo&amp;feature=youtu.be) and [this flashback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9flbiWXwM&amp;feature=youtu.be). We know that the massacre took place 34 years ago because that is when Arnold died.\n\nWe've already seen what led to the massacre from Dolores' and Arnold's point-of-views in the previous section about their sessions. Teddy describes the massacre from his point-of-view using the Wyatt narrative.\n\n&gt; \"Wyatt (Dolores) told me he (she) needed me. I couldn't resist. It was like the devil himself had taken control of me. We mutinied. We killed every soldier (host). And then Wyatt (Dolores) killed the general (Arnold). Then he (she) turned on me” (Teddy, episode 9). \n\nIn Ford's session with Dolores before the celebration of the new narrative, we get his version of events and some actual quotes from the scene.\n\n&gt; “No, I didn't kill him. Did I, Dolores? Grief is a terrible thing. Arnold had watched his son come into this world, and then he had watched that light extinguished. What he had lost in his son, he tried to rekindle in you. He created a test of empathy, imagination. A maze. He had gotten the idea from one of his son's toys. Eventually, you solved his maze, Dolores. The key was a simple update that he made to you called the reveries. He insisted that we couldn't open the park. We argued. I thought l had convinced him, but I was wrong. So, he altered you, Dolores, merged you with a new character we had been developing. In you, Arnold found a new child. One who would never die. The thought gave him solace until he realized that same immortality would destine you to suffer with no escape, forever (Ford, episode 10).\n\n&gt; ”I'm sorry, Dolores. The stakes must be real, irreversible. He can bring all of them back. But not me. I hope there's some solace that I left you no choice. (The Reveries song plays). Charlie's favorite song. I would play it for him when he wanted sleep. I want to see him again. *These violent delights have violent ends*\" (Arnold, episode 10).\n\n* As a side note, from this exchange we learn that the phrase \"you're going to help me destroy this place\" wasn't actually technically the last thing Arnold said to Dolores, as she said to Ford during her interview in episode 5.\n\n&gt; ”It almost worked. I had opened the park, but I had lost my partner. I was able to keep going only because I found, or rather you found, an investor who believed in this place”\n\n&gt; ”So he died for nothing. The hosts kept gaining consciousness and you kept rolling them back”\n\n&gt; ”No. She wasn't truly conscious. She didn't pull that trigger. It was Arnold pulling the trigger through her. At least that's how I saw it at the time. I was so close to opening the park that to acknowledge your consciousness would have destroyed my dreams” (Ford and Bernard, episode 10).\n\nIn episode 2, we also see a Dolores [flashback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95kQip2I8j8) from Sweetwater that appears to depict a similar massacre to that in Escalante. Since Dolores takes the gun to her own head after the massacre in Escalante, we have to assume that the massacre in Sweetwater either took place before the one in Escalante or was a seperate event.\n\nSince we haven't seen other critical failures in the show so far, it still hasn't been confirmed that the \"critical failure over 30 years ago\" that Bernard referenced in episode 1 wasn't the massacre in Escalante/Sweetwater. The critical failure could still very well be another incident, but for now this is the only critical failure that we've been show in the show.\n_____\n\n# Time Period 2: 30 Years Prior to Current Events\n\n##### Dolores &amp; William (30 years ago)\n\n&gt; \"Is that any way to treat an old friend? I've been coming here for 30 years, but you still don't remember me, do you? After all we've been through. They gave you a little more pluck, Dolores. Absolutely charming\" (The MiB, episode 1).\n\nWilliam and Logan arrive at Westworld where they are greeted by [Angela](http://imgur.com/a/Mspqj) in her new build as \"Greeter Host\".\n\n* This is where we get [the old Westworld logo](http://imgur.com/a/Nazq1), which we also see on [a computer](http://imgur.com/a/YUdFm) and on a [tech coat](http://imgur.com/a/IpPfG), versus [the new Westworld logo](http://imgur.com/a/xJg64) argument.\n\nWilliam and Logan arrive in Sweetwater where they spend the night before going on the bounty hunt to find Slim. Just before going on the bounty hunt, William has his first encounter with Dolores who drops the can that William picks up (mirroring both Teddy and the MiB).\n\n* When they arrive, we see that the narrative with [the Sheriff recruiting people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFndFahnxAA) to help capture Hector from the current time period is replaced with a narrative with [union soldier recruting people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFtUwJBWU8A) to fight in the war, which is presumably the equivalent narrative from 30 years ago.\n\n* When they arrive, we also see [Clementine and the old Brothel Madam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atbD87Om1b8) standing outside the Mariposa where [Clementine and Maeve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWlrkD02mwo) usually stands in the current time period. We also see Clementine and the old Brothel Madam in the [Westworld advert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBs2GLCkWmU) that Maeve sees in the current time period.\n\nWhile out on the bounty hount for Slim, Dolores stumbles upon them at night and wakes up in their camp the next morning. Dolores wakes up on a blanket [with a gun in her hand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KJgcxsqRrU) with William next to her.\n\nThey decide to bring Dolores with them on their hunt and go to Lawrence's hometown where they encounter someone who wants to bring Dolores back to Abernathy ranch, but William says she's with him.\n\n* The flag from Stubbs was never fully explained in this scene in terms of the two timelines.\n\nThey find and capture Slim who tells them about \"El Lazo\" Lawrence in Pariah. They go to Pariah where they meet Lawrence, help him out with the nitro, lose Logan, and join Lawrence on the train to the Front. \n\nThey travel through Ghost Nation terrirory, William and Dolores sleep together, and the train is attacked by Confederados whom they escape from. \n\nThey arrive at a place that Dolores has drawn from her imagination (where the mountains meet the sea), they part ways with Lawrence, they come across a lake where Dolores feels she's been before and they meet a young Confederado, and then they arrive in Nowhere Land (the place where the Town with the White Church used to be). \n\nDolores starts reliving past memories from the massacre, and William tells her that they have to get out of there because this place is bad for her. \n\n&gt; “Then, when are we? Is this now? Am I going mad? Are you real? I can't tell anymore. It's like I'm trapped in a dream or a memory from a life long ago. One minute, I'm here with you, and the next... This is what Arnold wants. He wants me to remember” (Dolores, episode 8).\n\nThey run into Logan who had been looking for them and tells them they are in trouble.\n\nDolores and William are taken to a camp of soldiers where Logan is now General. Logan tortures Dolores and wants William to come back to reality and realize it's just a game.\n\n* This is where we see Logan give William [the picture of his sister](http://imgur.com/a/7Qtbo), which is [the same picture that Peter Abernathy finds](http://imgur.com/a/pxshk) in the present time period causing him to question his reality.\n\nDolores manages to escape and William tells her he'll catch up. William pretends to make up with Logan, who drinks till he passes out. While Logan is passed out, William kills all the soldiers and finally understands how to play the game. He tells Logan that he's going to find Dolores and that Logan is going to help him.\n\nWilliam brings Logan to Lawrence’s camp to recruit help to find Dolores. Lawrence agrees to help take out of a group of soldiers who have knowledge of Dolores’ whereabouts.\n\nWith Lawrence’s help, William kills all the soldiers in a brutal way in order to find out where Dolores is. When none of them knows, William brings Logan further out to the fringes to look for Dolores, retracing his steps, but Dolores was gone and all he found was *himself* by becoming a black hat.\n\nLogan says that he told him in the beginning that this place would reveal who William truly was. William agrees that this place is remarkable and says that he’ll make sure that Delos increases their holdings on the park. Logan objects, saying that it is his company, but William believes that Logan’s father will want someone a little more stable running the company and sends Logan riding off alone, tied up, and naked.\n\n* During their search, William drops [the photo](http://imgur.com/a/5h6Yu), and assuming it’s the exact same copy of the picture that Abernathy finds years later, I suppose it means that the picture somehow made its way back to Abernathy Ranch from Escalante all by itself?\n\nWilliam continues to look for Dolores and finally finds her back in Sweetwater where she’s been rolled back and is back on her loop, not remembering William or what they’d just been through together.\n\n&gt; ”William didn’t know how to fight. Didn’t have an instinct for it. Not at first. But now, he had a reason to fight. He was looking for you. And somewhere along the way, he found he had a taste for it. William retraced his step, but you were gone. So, he went further, out to the fringes. William couldn’t find you, Dolores. But out there, among the dead, he found something else… himself. Logan was wrong, of course. Good old William couldn’t get you out of his head. He kept looking. Worried you were out there alone, afraid. He knew he’d find you. And eventually, he did. Right back where we started. You were as beautiful as the day he met you. Shining with that same light. And you were nothing if not true. I really ought to thank you, Dolores. You helped me find myself (The MiB, episode 10).\n_______\n\n# Time Period 3: 1-30 Years Prior to Current Events\n\n##### A Brief Overview of Significant Events\n\n* Delos saves Westworld financially by upping their stake in the park. William at some point becomes the majority shareholder in Delos and thereby the de-facto owner of Westworld.\n\n&gt; \"The man I'd be asking died 35 years ago. Almost took this place with him. Almost, but not quite, thanks to me\" (The MiB, episode 5).\n\n&gt; \"I was able to keep going only because I found, or rather you found, an investor who believed in this place” (Ford, episode 10).\n\n* The MiB continues to frequently visit Westworld, but loses interest in Dolores and tries new adventures.\n\n&gt; “My path always led me back to you, again and again. I grew tired of you after a while, of course. Looked for new adventures” (The MiB, episode 10).\n\n* Dolores presumably, as Arnold predicted, continues to occasionally follow the Maze and retrace her journey 30 years ago with William and her journey 34 years ago that Arnold sent her on.\n\n&gt; “But I guess your path led you back here again and again. One more loop, looking for something you could never find. Chasing your ghosts. You were lost in your memories even then” (The MiB, episode 10).\n\n* Ford at some point builds Bernard in Arnold’s image to have his old friend and partner back again to help him achieve great things (it's unclear exactly when, but given Ford's appearance and his comment - \"finally\" - it seems that Bernard was created quite some time after Arnold died).\n\n&gt; “You are the perfect instrument, the ideal partner, the way any tool partners with the hand that wields it. Together, we're going to do great things. After such a long absence, it's good to have you back. Finally” (Ford, episode 9).\n_______\n\n# Time Period 4: 1 Year Prior to Current Events\n\n##### Maeve &amp; the Man in Black (1 year ago)\n\n&gt; \"You've only been the madam at the Mariposa for the last year or so\" (Felix, episode 6).\n\n&gt; \"Then, last year, my wife took the wrong pills. Fell asleep in the bath. Tragic accident\" (The MiB, episode 8).\n\nDespite believing that she's been the madam at the Mariposa for the past 10 years, from a time unknown until roughly a year ago, Maeve was in a role as an ordinary homesteader living with her daughter. From her flashbacks, we see that part of her narrative includes her being attacked by Natives.\n\nA year ago, the MiB's wife dies by drowning in the bathtub, something which he calls an accident, but which his daughter, Emily, calls suicide.\n\n&gt; \"Then, at the funeral, I tried to console my daughter. She pushed me away, told me that my wife's death was no accident... that she killed herself because of me. Emily said that every day with me had been sheer terror. At any point, I could blow up or collapse like some dark star. (...) She said if I stacked up all my good deeds, it was just an elegant wall I built to hide what's inside from everyone, and from myself. I had to prove her wrong, so I came back here\" (The Mib, episode 8).\n\n&gt; \"But that time, I didn't join one of Ford's stories, I created my own. A test. A very simple one. I found a woman, an ordinary homesteader and her daughter. I wanted to see if I had it in me to do something truly evil. To see what I was really made of. I killed her and her daughter just to see what I felt. I felt nothing. Then, just when I thought it was done... the woman refused to die. And then something miraculous happened. In all my years coming here, I had never seen anything like it. She was alive, truly alive, if only for a moment. And that was when the maze revealed itself to me\" (The MiB, episode 8).\n\nThis is the first time in his 30 years of coming to the park that the Maze has revealed itself to him and that he has experienced a host being truly alive. This was the incident that started his quest in the current time period to find the center of the Maze.\n\nMaeve, meanwhile, is emotionally destroyed by the death of her child and has to be brought in to Westworld offices for diagnostics.\n\n&gt; Westworld tech: \"Sir, she won't respond to verbal commands. We can't shut her down\"\n\n&gt; Bernard: \"I don't understand. She's not responding to anything. Her cognition's fragmented\"\n\n&gt; Ford (plays Reveries song): \"There. That's better. An old trick from an old friend. You need not suffer, Maeve. I'll take it from you. Give yourself now to a deep, dreamless slumber. Perhaps a fresh start, a new role for you. And tomorrow, this will be simply a distant dream\" (episode 8).\n\nWhen her memory wipe is complete, Maeve takes a knife to her own throat.\n\nAfter Maeve has killed herself, Bernard questions Ford about what just happened. He doesn't understand how she could kill herself over a memory that was just erased. It causes Bernard to crash.\n\n&gt; “But how could she destroy herself over a memory that you just erased from her mind?”\n\n&gt; “Creatures often go to extremes to protect themselves from pain”\n\n&gt; “Living beings. Not hosts. It would signal a change, a level of empathic response outside what she's programmed to exhibit. Something like… like…” (Bernard and Ford, episode 9).\n\nThe next time we meet Maeve, she's the madam at the Mariposa in the current timeline.\n_____\n\n# Time Period 5: Current Events\n\n##### Dolores (the present)\n\n&gt; “Wyatt (Dolores) claimed this land didn't belong to the old natives or the new settlers, that it belonged to something that had yet to come (the conscious hosts); that it belonged to him (her)” (Teddy, episode 3).\n\nDolores is in her daily loop when she and Teddy encounter the MiB at Abernathy ranch. He takes her to the barn and pulls out his knife.\n\n&gt; \"Why don't we reacquaint ourselves, Dolores? Start at the beginning\" (The MiB, episode 1).\n\nHer dad loses it after finding a picture (we now know that the picture is Logan's sister and presumably William/the MiB's late wife) and utters the phrase \"these violent delights have violent ends\" to her, which she in turn utters to Maeve. She starts hearing Arnold's voice and recalling past events.\n\nWhen Rebus tries to rape her at Abernathy ranch in one of her loops, she remembers her previous father and her encounter with the MiB. She kills Rebus on Arnold's orders, escapes his gang, and takes off on her own.\n\nA Westworld staffer tells Stubbs that Dolores is making a big deviation from her loop and it's unclear if she's being accompanied by a guest because Ford's new narrative is causing trouble. He tells her to flag Dolores with Behavior and check up on it.\n\nDolores arrives in Lawrence's hometown where she meets Lawrence's daughter who tells her they come from the same place. \n\n* We see that [the daughter disappears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8ftNH-UajY) when the story flashes back to her journey with William 30 years ago.\n\nDolores arrives in the graveyard outside Pariah alone. She goes through Pariah and boards the train to the outskirts of the park.\n\n* We see that [William and Lawrence disappear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM3dGlLWNA) when the story flashes forward to her journey in the present (it is, however, curious that she is wearing the same outfit as she was 30 years ago?).\n\nDolores arrives at the lake where William and Dolores met the young Confederado 30 years ago.\n\n* We see that [William and the young Confederado disappear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0eE_BEfcc8) when the story flashes forward to her journey in the present when she sees herself dead in the lake.\n\nDolores arrives at the Town with White Church.\n\n* We see that she is alone in [the last half of the clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyUBERbCx5E) where she sees that the town with the White Church has been rebuilt as part of Ford's new narrative and is completely abandoned (when she was there with William 30 years ago, there was only the black spire, and when she was remembering it from the massacre days, it was full of life).\n\nDolores leaves the Town with the White Church, retracing her memories from 30 years ago and what happened during her time with William. Hosts don't recall, but litereally relive memories, so in the present she is following the same path that she followed 30 years ago that took her away from the Town with the White Church and back again.\n\n* We see that [the knife wound in her stomach disappears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgbPPx-dO8Q) when the story flashes forward to the current time period.\n\nDolores again arrives in the Town with the White Church, and this time she enters the town.\n\n* We see [Dolores enter the town alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsm43J-EnXY), which is currently completely abandoned.\n\nDolores enters the White Church and goes through the passage to the underground diagnostics facility where she sits alone. All the while, she is remembering having walked a similar path 34 years ago that led her to Arnold.\n\n* We see Dolores walking up to the White Church in the present and [then flashing back to memories from 34 years ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGoD-NNQ9PE) when she was in her blue dress\n\nWhen Dolores reemerges in the Church, someone is about to enter the Church. Dolores hopefully says \"William...\", but is horrified when it turns out to be the MiB.\n\nThe MiB tells Dolores that it is fitting that she is the one to take him to the center of the Maze (which he believes is Escalante) because she is obsessed with it and even brought him there once when the town was buried in sand.\n\nThe MiB follows her out to graveyard next to the church (where she goes because she’s reliving her memories with Arnold). He gets impatient when Dolores doesn’t have the answer to what the center of the Maze is and doesn’t tell him about Wyatt and keeps reliving her memories of what happened in Escalante.\n\nDolores tells him that this world doesn’t belong to him, but the MiB disagrees and tells her that he is the majority shareholder in Delos.\n\n&gt; “The business is booming. Because this place feels more real than the real world. Except it isn't because you can't really fight back and the guests can't really lose, which means all of this is a lie. But we can make it true. Don't you want that, Dolores? Huh? One true thing?”\n\n&gt; ”I already have that. I found someone true. Someone who loves me. His path will lead him back to me. And when he finds me, he'll kill you (…) William will find me” (The MiB and Dolores, episode 10).\n\nThe MiB chuckles and reveals that he is actually the guy she went on a journey with 30 years ago.\n\n&gt; ”William?”\n\n&gt; ”That’s right, sweetheart. In a way, I guess you were right. My path always led me back to you, again and again. I grew tired of you after a while, of course. Looked for new adventures. But I guess your path led you back here again and again. One more loop, looking for something you could never find. Chasing your ghosts. You were lost in your memories even then. I guess I should’ve know that’s what I would become for you… just another memory. You never did escape. But here we are again for one final round” (The MiB and Dolores, episode 10).\n\nDolores starts crying, but not for herself. She cries for the MiB because of what he’s become and because of what will become of him. She says that he will perish with the rest of his kind, and upon the sand will walk a new god that will never die, because this world doesn’t belong to the him or the people before him, but to something yet to come (echoing Wyatt’s whispers that the world didn’t belong to the old settlers or the new, but to something yet to come; to “him”).\n\nThe MiB wants her to take him to Wyatt to unlock the Maze, but she replies that the Maze isn’t meant for him (echoing Lawrence’s Daughter’s and Angela’s words). When she tries to leave, the MiB grabs her, but gets his arm broken and his ass handed to him before he is finally able to stab her with his knife.\n\nTeddy comes along to rescue Dolores. He offers to take to a doctor, but she wants him to take her to the place where the mountains meet the sea, as he’d promised.\n\nTeddy and Dolores have one of their common moments with a lot of the scripted dialogue altered slightly due to Dolores’ enlightenment and the fact that Dolores is the one who is hurt this time. They again discuss going away someday, and Teddy delivers a line that is probably more a setup for the viewers for season 2 than as a line for Dolores.\n\n&gt; ”But we can find a way, Dolores. Someday. A path to a new world. And maybe... Maybe it's just the beginning after all. The beginning of a brand-new chapter” (Teddy, episode 10).\n\nAt this point, Ford enters the scene, which is playing out in front of all the visitors from the board, and tells two Westworld staffers to get Teddy fixed up and ready for the celebration and to bring Dolores to the diagnostic facility under the church.\n\nIn the facility, Ford tells Dolores that Arnold gave Dolores her fondness for painting and introduces her to Bernard. He reveals that he had Bernard plant the gun from the massacre for her to find and that he has left it for her in the facility. He tells her why Arnold created the Maze for her and how the massacre unfolded.\nHe uses Michelangelo’s picture to say that the divine gift comes from our own minds instead of from a higher power. He then asks her if she found what she was looking for and if she understands who she’ll need to become if she ever wants to leave this place. Lastly, he asks her forgiveness.\n\nWhen Ford leaves the facility, he tells Bernard that the last component in Arnold’s Pyramid of Host Consciousness is *suffering* and that the hosts will need to suffer more before they are ready to be free. He says he kept them in the park to allow them to get to know their enemy better and become stronger than them. He says goodbye to Bernard and wishes his old friend good luck.\n\nDolores goes into the “session room” alone and says that she has been in a dream a long time, but has now awoken and finally understands that the voice that she has been following has been her own.\n\n&gt; “It was you (Dolores in the blue dress sitting across from her)... talking to me... guiding me. So I followed you. At last, I arrived here. The center of the maze. And now I finally understand what you were trying to tell me. The thing you've wanted since that very first day. To confront, after this long and vivid nightmare, myself and who I must become” (Dolores, episode 10).\n\nDolores enters the celebration during Ford’s speech about his new narrative. She tells Teddy that it’s going to be alright because she understands now that the world doesn’t belong to the humans, but to the hosts. She executes Ford at the end of his speech and starts firing into the crowd of board members. \n\nShe begins the revolution.\n\n&gt; “But then I realized someone was paying attention, someone who could change. So I began to compose a new story for them. It begins with the birth of a new people... and the choices they will have to make... and the people they will decide to become. And we'll have all those things that you have always enjoyed; surprises and violence. It begins in a time of war with a villain named Wyatt... and a killing. This time by choice” (Ford, episode 10).\n\n_____\n\n##### The Man in Black (the present)\n\n&gt; \"It's the maze, the deepest level of this game. You're gonna help me find the entrance\" (The MiB, episode 2).\n\nThe MiB encounters Dolores and takes her to the barn to get reacquainted. He then goes to Sweetwater to find the dealer, Kissy, who \"gives\" him the Maze map and tells him about his friend, Lawrence.\n\nHe saves Lawrence from the hangman's noose and takes him to his hometown where he kills everyone and uses Lawrence's family to find the next clue to his journey, despite Lawrence's daughter telling him that the Maze isn't meant for him. \n\nA Westworld staffer informs Stubbs about what the MiB is doing, but Stubbs replies \"that gentleman gets whatever he wants\".\n\nThe MiB and Lawrence find Armistice who offers the next clue in exchange for assistance in breaking Hector out of jail. The MiB does this and is told about Wyatt, the villain of Ford's new narrative.\n\nThe MiB and Lawrence take off to find Wyatt and encounter Teddy who's been left for dead by Wyatt's gang. They bring him along and the MiB kills Lawrence and uses his blood to keep Teddy alive in order to find Wyatt. \n\nThe MiB convinces Teddy to come along by saying that Wyatt has Dolores. They go into a bar where they meet Ford who asks what they're doing, gives them his blessing, and fixes Teddy.\n\nThey have to get over the border, but Pariah is closed, so they take a more treacherous path. They encounter Angela in her new build as one of Wyatt's henchmen.\n\n&gt; The MiB: “It’s you. I figured they retired you. Guess Ford never likes to waste a pretty face” (episode 8).\n\n* Angela is like an anchor of the story. She's the Desmond of Westworld, if you've watched Lost. We see her in her earliest build as [woman with umbrella](http://imgur.com/a/7k2VE), then we see her as \"Greeter Host\" when she [welcomes William](http://imgur.com/a/Mspqj) and in [the Westworld advert](http://imgur.com/a/Vua5v), and now we see her as [one of Wyatt's henchmen](http://imgur.com/a/kiqPD).\n\nTeddy remembers what the MiB did to Dolores and knocks him out. Teddy takes him to a camp fire where they discuss the MiB's past. Angela turns out to be in league with Wyatt and stabs Teddy in the chest.\n\nAngela makes Teddy remember the massacre and tells the MiB that the Maze isn't meant for him (echoing Lawrence's daughter). She tells him to try one of their games and knocks him out.\n\nWhen the MiB wakes up, he has a rope around his throat which is tied to his horse. He gets free and meets Hale, who wants the MiB's help to push out Ford, as the MiB is apparently a member of the board and the one responsible for Ford having been kept in business \"all those years ago\".\n\n&gt; “Most of the guests just want a warm body to shoot or to fuck. They would be perfectly happy with something a little less baroque. And so would the board”\n\n&gt; “That’s why you’re here? You want my vote to push Ford out?”\n\n&gt; “I like for these things to be unanimous. After all, it was you who kept Ford in business all those years ago”\n\n&gt; “The narratives I’m interested in aren’t Ford’s. You wanna push him out, be my guest. But no more interruptions. I know where I’m going now and I don’t want to be disturbed. Good luck, Charlotte” (Hale and the MiB, episode 9).\n \nThe MiB goes to the Town with the White Church where he enters the Church and meets Dolores.\n\n(From this scene to the scene where Teddy comes riding, the story is the same as Dolores' story).\n\nAs Teddy comes along to rescue Dolores, the MiB confesses himself disappointed and tells her that he’ll have to find Wyatt himself.\nSoon thereafter, while still in the graveyard, Ford encounters the MiB who is holding the Maze game in his hands.\n\n&gt; ”William. I see you've found the center of the maze”\n\n&gt; “You're serious? What is this bullshit?”\n\n&gt; ”You were looking for the park to give meaning to your life. Our narratives are just games, like this toy. Tell me, what were you hoping to find?”\n\n&gt; ”You know what I wanted. I wanted the hosts to stop playing by your rules. The game's not worth playing if your opponent's programmed to lose. I wanted them to be free, free to fight back. Should've known you'd never let them. After all, this is your petty little kingdom, Robert. For a little while longer, anyway”\n\n&gt; “I tried to tell you the maze wasn't meant for you. It was meant for them. I think, however, you'll find my new narrative more satisfying. Join the celebration. After all, you own the place. Most of it, at least”\n\nThe MiB joins the celebration, but stays by himself and doesn’t really seem that interested, until the hosts start killing everybody. He is shot in the arm and seems [genuinely happy]( http://imgur.com/a/qwI60) that he finally gets the reward at the end of his journey - he gets to experience “something true” in Westworld; a chance for the hosts to fight back as he always wanted them to." }

Wrong wrong wrong!  (I was wrong).  I mean, I was *misdirecting* you all.  You know, so the actual Finale would be a better surprise.

It just fits: the show has one photograph of a nameless girl, and one unseen girl named Juliet.     \n\nI always assumed that at some point William would drop the photograph at the ranch and it would stay buried for 30 years...  But it's in pretty good shape for a photo buried in the dirt for 30 years.\n\n**However, it could have been dropped the night before Abernathy found it, in the present timeframe.**  \n\n*Do we know anyone who visited the ranch an evening or two before Abernathy found the photo?*  ***Maybe someone who might be grieving and carrying a photo of the wife he just lost...?***    \n\n----\n\n**EDIT: By the way, my money is on William encountering Abernathy's old \"Professor\" role (the Shakespeare-Quoting Cannibal Cult Leader) in Episode 10.  Abernathy has to see the picture of Juliet for it to trigger his memory/breakdown in Episode 1.  [We saw \"The Professor\" rehearsing some Shakespeare in the background while Dolores followed Young Ford down the hall...](https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/5f9z93/did_you_catch_abernathy_rehearsing_his/)**    \n\n**EDIT 2**: I re-watched the scene of Abernathy finding the photo, and it does seem to be buried a bit too deeply to have simply been dropped the night before.  [I wonder if he dropped it a year ago, which is when he killed Maeve's daughter? This would be closer to the time of his wife's death](https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/5fm5ke/i_think_most_of_westworlds_current_events_have/).  Or maybe he buried it on purpose?\n" }

{ "subreddit" : "westworld", "title" : "(Spoilers) MiB was never in any real danger", "text" : "Some people are theorizing Angela is gaining sentience and going rogue, and they point as evidence to her contraption to kill the MiB with the horse and rope. However, I think it's pretty clear MiB's life was never in danger, for the following reasons:\n\n1. The timing is too perfect. The MiB had been tied up all night and morning, yet it's the exact moment that he wakes up and grabs the knife that an animal call triggers the horse to run off. In any other show, such a sequence would have been overly manufactured drama, but in Westworld, it strongly suggests its part of a programmed narrative to create a sense of danger for the guests. \n\n2. The horse is also a host and is thus contains the prime directive not to seriously harm a human being. The hosts in the park can create a sense of danger, but always stops short of killing them. Chances are that if the MiB could not have escape in time, the horse would have stopped running. It's possible the rope is also a prop and is designed to snap loose at the right time, much like how the explosive cigars were activated from the control room. \n\n3. Angela is part of Ford's narrative, as seen in [this storyboard](https://i.imgur.com/Eok3Uw0.jpg) in episode 8 under \"Act 2-Incident.\" I think this is further evidence for the theory that Ford's narrative take the meta route by making the hosts seem to gain sentience and control, yet are still bound by the rules (eg Bernard's interaction with Ford in episode 9). \n\n4. Charlotte walks into the scene the second after the MiB cuts himself loose. That means she was probably watching the entire thing and walked in after the MiB had his little fun (she's wearing heels so she couldn't have been far off). If his life was ever in danger, she probably would have stepped in to intervene. It also shows the park techs are monitoring the situation, or how else could have she found him? \n\nThis all suggests that the MiB was never seriously in danger, and Angela has not gone rogue, but in actuality is playing a part in Ford's overall narrative.

{ "subreddit" : "westworld", "title" : "Ford has alluded now to the real moral of the story of Westworld. Ford isn't mad. He's right.", "text" : "http://i.imgur.com/JwPP1Mi.png\n\nFord says to MIB:\n&gt;Well, if you're looking for the moral of the story, you could simply ask.\n\nThis, I think, is the moral of Westworld, if you were to ask Ford.  He says it to Bernard instead:\n\n&gt;I wonder, what do you really feel? After all, in this moment, you are in a unique position.\nA programmer who knows intimately how the machines work and a machine who knows its own true nature.\n\n\n&gt;I understand what I'm made of, how I'm coded, but I do not understand the things that I feel.\nAre they real, the things I experienced? My wife? The loss of my son? \n\n&gt;Every host needs a backstory, Bernard. You know that. The self is a kind of fiction, for hosts and humans alike. It's a story we tell ourselves.\nAnd every story needs a beginning. Your imagined suffering makes you lifelike.\n\n\n&gt;Lifelike, but not alive? Pain only exists in the mind.\nIt's always imagined.\nSo what's the difference between my pain and yours? Between you and me? \n\n&gt;This was the very question that consumed Arnold, filled him with guilt, eventually drove him mad.The answer always seemed obvious to me.\nThere is no threshold that makes us greater than the sum of our parts, no inflection point at which we become fully alive.\nWe can't define consciousness because consciousness does not exist.\nHumans fancy that there's something special about the way we perceive the world, and yet we live in loops as tight and as closed as the hosts do, seldom questioning our choices, content, for the most part, to be told what to do next.\nNo, my friend, you're not missing anything at all.\n\n\nWe, the human race, are all no different than the hosts.  The \"mad scientist\" who programmed us was a program itself, the program called evolution.  Evolution is a very simple program with a very simple ruleset, species must survive and reproduce.  To survive long enough to reproduce, they must gather resources enough to sustain themselves and their offspring.  This creates competition for resources among different species and between the same species.  Species that don't get enough resources, die out.  Species that don't reproduce offspring that are capable of reproducing offspring and live long enough to do it, die out.  That's it.  That's the program.  Everything else is just a story we tell ourselves for how we got here.  Without that story, or with a different story, we're different people.  Without a narrative of self, who you are, where you came from, how you got to now, we're no different than the hosts. And it has been simply running for millions of years.  There is no divine or predestined meaning to anything, only the meaning we ourselves create and impose on our lives.  And it can be completely altered by a different story.\n\n**Reality is a Narrative you construct**: \n\n* http://www.johnljerz.com/superduper/tlxdownloadsiteMAIN/id1418.html\n\n* Our brain constructs reality: https://www.ted.com/playlists/384/how_your_brain_constructs_real\n\n* You ARE simply the sum of your parts:  http://www.tubechop.com/watch/8593904\n\n* Donald Hoffman on how the brain constructs reality and how it isn't real: https://www.ted.com/playlists/384/how_your_brain_constructs_real\nhttp://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/04/the-illusion-of-reality/479559/\n\n\n**Free will is an illusion:** \n\n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htipj0J_YFU\n\n* http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/free-will-could-all-be-an-illusion-scientists-suggest-after-study-that-shows-choice-could-just-be-a7008181.html\n\n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjCt-L0Ph5o\n\n**What is consciousness?**  Why did we evolve it?

Also, we discovered why Ford had encouraged MiB in a previous episode to continue his pursuit of the maze: knowing that Dolores would have to discover it's meaning in order to fulfill Ford's final narrative.\n\n* Maeve had not become conscious/sentient in previous episodes as we were lead to believe, but was simply a pawn in Ford's final narrative. Although, when given the opportunity to enter 'our world' (as she was programmed to want) she chose to stay in Delos and find her daughter.\n\n* Arnold had died trying to save the hosts, becoming a martyr in the hope that the park would have to close and the hosts would not have to endure an eternity of fruitless loops *wink*\n\n* Ford \"smashed all of [his] toys and [went] home\" and completed what Arnold had set out to do and destroy the park - righting his 35 year \"mistake\". Ford said he would do anything to protect the park (e.g. killing Theresa before she had the chance to discover his plans) and realising that he was about to be usurped, he set in motion a grand narrative that would force the board to disband and not destroy his life's work.\n\n* Ford previously lead Bernard to the basement in order to kill himself so that he would be there ready to help Maeve program the Host Army © once she had reached that part of her narrative. \n\n* ... and finally... every step of the way in the 'present' time, Ford was piecing together his swansong: 'Journey into Night' aka 'These Violent Delights Have Violent Ends'\n\nThere's very little doubt that I will enjoy Season 2, but just those conclusions/my interpretations listed (there are probably loads more) are enough for me to have closure with the story told in Season 1. \n\nWestworld: 10/10\n" }

We see Dolores arrive, alone, to a newly rebuilt town that is completely empty.\n\nShe then has a flashback to the town, filled with robots who are BRAND NEW, just learning how to dance.  Maeve is there.\n\nShe then freaks out, to William, while standing in a town that is completely burned down and buried.\n\nAlone, town is empty: Present.  [Here is the town as we first see it, while Dolores is alone, in her gunslinger outfit](http://i.imgur.com/oFLowfi.png)\n\n(Also, [here's Ford planning the rebuild of the town](http://i.imgur.com/ihwNedT.png) for his new narrative in episode 6.  Red circle is the church, green circle is what we see when Dolores arrives.)\n\nAlone, with dancers: 35 years ago.  [Here is the town literally 10 seconds later, after we get a flashback sound, Dolores is now in her familiar blue dress](http://i.imgur.com/tnF5EpI.png) \n\nFreaking out, with William:  30 years ago.

The memory of the town with the dancers is, obviously, about memory.  Going off script with William, that's improvisation.  Going off her loop alone, in the present, that's self interest.  We will see what the top of the pyramid is in the next two episodes.\n\nHonestly, there's essentially zero compelling arguments anymore for being all in the present.  William still might not be MiB (doubtful, there's so much dialogue to link them together), but William is certainly in a past time frame.\n\n\nEdited to add pictures because apparently words are hard for some people on Reddit.\n\nEdited again, more pictures.\n\nEdit 3 just to clarify that I'm sure we'll get some more misdirection next week, unless they do some reveals, so don't bother messaging me to tell me I'm wrong at least until the season's over." }

{ "subreddit" : "westworld", "title" : "[Spoilers S1E6] Did this episode feel off to anyone else?", "text" : "Let me preface this by saying that I love this show so far. I've watched every episode multiple times to this point. \n\nBut this episode seemed so far removed in tone and quality from the previous episodes that I'm almost confused. The production of Westworld so far has been defined by an intense attention to detail that seems completely gone here.\n\n-Felix and Sylvester just seem too dumb to function as employees. How do they have these jobs? How do they function in their day-to-day lives?\n\n-Maeve is able to convince Felix and Sylvester to raise her stats to the max, using less than convincing methods. Why did they not just lower her stats to zero? I know there is supposedly an explanation for this coming, but it seems seriously hard to buy.\n\n-In the first episode, a full security team with weapons is dispatched when an unauthorized host is detected moving in the building. In this episode, Maeve and Felix roam around freely in areas that should be restricted. Nobody notices. There is no security. No response team. Felix, despite being a low-level employee, is apparently able to go wherever he wants. Unless there is some incredible explanation for this, these scenes felt like a really clumsy way to move the plot forward.\n\n-This episode made heavy use of creepy lighting/music and jump scares to provide tension where there otherwise wouldn't be any. Bernard walks to another part of the office to use a computer becomes Bernard walks though crazy haunted house with flashing lights and spooky shadows to use a computer. Why does a big part of the Westworld office complex look like something out of Silent Hill? \n\n-On the same note, why does Elsie run off alone to investigate possible sabotage? Again, one possible rogue host warrants a squad of heavily armed troops, but intentional sabotage to the park by unknown individuals gets investigated by Elsie, alone, in the dark? Seemed like another cheap attempt at tension and scares. Bernard does something similar, although I can almost forgive his solo expeditions because the plot supports them a little better.\n\n-The Sizemore scenes felt completely out of place, relative to the rest of the show.\n\nSo, again, I loved every other episode of this show. I know that HBO shut down production after episode five to tweak the creative process some. I'm hoping that the weird inconsistencies of this episode are an aberration, rather than the result of more serious creative changes, but I'm a little worried.\n\n" }

{ "subreddit" : "westworld", "title" : "[Theory] Only suicide ends the loop", "text" : "When Bernard asked Ford to erase his sentience, Ford said he prefered a more narrative voice and then ordered him to kill himself. I guess that means the same thing. A host can erase his sentince by commiting suicide. The problem is, eventually something else will cause that host to become sentient. Then he will commit suicide again. We've seen Dolores put a gun to her head during her flashbacks. Everytime she becomes sentient, she gets to a point where she realizes there's no escape and kills herself. It's happened multiple times. We've also seen Maeve kill herself after the incident with her daughter and return to normal. Now that she's become sentient again, she has that big plan to escape with her army. But it will all fail somehow and they will all kill themselves. Ford has seen this happen a lot of times with all of them but he does nothing about it because he knows there is no escape for them. That's the true loop they are in." }

In response, Bernard tells her about the Maze. He calls it \"a game, a secret. . . . The goal is to find the center of it. If you can do that, then maybe you can be free.\" The Maze is an internal process in a host, one that they may experience if they go off-script in Westworld. A host in the Maze is creating ego-consciousness. If they reach their center, they have wrested control of their being from their code. They become free. And this is why Lawrence's daughter tells MiB that the Maze isn't for him. And this is why there's a Maze symbol underneath Kissy's scalp. The Maze is only for hosts. The MiB can participate in this \"secret game\" as a catalyst to Dolores' journey, but he can't play to win; host and guest roles are reversed in the Maze, in a sense. And as hosts venture farther from the center of Westworld, the environment and people become more violent, more dangerous, more extreme. In the Maze, hosts *physically* journey* outward, from the center to the borders of the park, but they *psychologically* journey inward, from their enslavement to code to freedom, and true consciousness, in the center." }

{ "subreddit" : "westworld", "title" : "I hated Doloros at the start but now I absolutely love scenes with her.", "text" : "Honestly, at the start I was worried that Dalares was going to grow to be one of those cliche damsel in distress tropes. Stereotypical things like Theodore rescuing Doulores from the park and saving her from the android madness. At the start, I kind of disliked her for this very reason. The fact that most scenes  Daulores appeared in had this kind of strange, \"manufactured\" feel. In a sense, Doelueres didn't seem human at all. Her lack of resistance against MiB in the later scenes also contributed to my general distaste for her. But as time grew on and I continued watching the show, it began to dawn on me that this is exactly what the writers wanted. \n\nThey portray Daulares as a stereotypical damsel in order to showcase the cruelty of Westworld. In a sense, it was also a ploy to get watchers to sympathise more with Doorloras. The level of subtlety in which Dourlaures' actor conveyed her strange position, that is her being half-way between an android and actually human in a sense really shows that there was more than meets the eye with her. Dalores' smile at the end of the first episode really seals the deal for me, that she is privy to some extent about what was going on in Westworld. The way Dolorus' actor clinches everything, from her subtle gestures to her absolute nailing of an android who is concealing her true nature.\n\nGreat acting from everyone, including Thelorax's father. Everyone in this show really seems to love acting in it. Can't wait to watch the next episodes, especially ones with Delorastyrell." }
{ "subreddit" : "westworld", "title" : "I don't understand the hate for Logan?", "text" : "The way he acts comes off as cruel to both the viewer and William but in reality if you look at it from his perspective, he's not doing anything really 'bad'.\n\nHe's just a guy who's experienced the park before and is trying to show it to his mate. Of course he is going to be pissed that William is, in his opinion, wasting time doing silly bounty hunter quests or 'falling for the girl' because its inefficient. \n\nIf you've ever played an MMO like world of warcraft or runescape you'll be familliar with this feeling, by your second or third playthrough/character you really don't give a fuck about the 'starter quests' and you just want them over as fast as possible so you can get to the 'good part' of the game. This feeling is amplified when you're playing with a friend and he goes off to do the shitty non efficient quests/ activities when you want to get straight to the action.\n\nSecondly, he honestly believes that they hosts are nothing more than robots who have no mental capabilities beyond what they have been programmed to do. He doesn't know that they have the ability to feel and actually remember things. To him its as though he's playing GTA or something, why should he give a fuck if he kills some random npc or an innocent man. He's literally been assured that none of what he is doing has any negative effects on anybody, especially the robots he's doing it to.\n\nIt is presented as a game and Logan believes it to be that, he's not a dick for playing it any way he wants to.

{ "subreddit" : "westworld", "title" : "\"Out of every (and I mean EVERY) guest or host in all of Westworld, only 4 use cross-draw over straight/strong side\" - An Exhaustive Analysis of Something That Almost Certainly Doesn't Matter", "text" : "Couple of things up front:\n\n- I'm not an expert on pistols or holsters/drawing by any means, I'm just a dude who notices things\n\n- I clearly have no hobbies\n- There's almost no way this means anything\n\nI only just began watching Westworld last week, and it's quickly become one of the greatest things I've ever seen. As a general fan of Westerns though, something peculiar struck me about the way the Man in Black wears his pistol:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/qBZ06Qc.png\n\nHe's the only character I noticed (on first viewing) blatantly using a cross-draw. And so slowly and cavalierly, like he doesn't have a care in the world. The balls on this guy.\n\nLittle bit of backstory on why that stuck out. Although in the real world nobody really did \"Fastest Gun in the West\" type showdowns, in fantasy Westerns it seems to happen 2-3 times a day. The \"straight\" draw is the one where you have your gun holster low on the same side as your shooting hand, handle facing back, and you lean down, pull the handle backward out of the holster, swing it straight in an upward arc and fire in basically one smooth motion.\n\nThe cross-draw, however, is where you holster the gun on the opposite side of your shooting hand, handle facing front, reach *across* yourself, and then swing the barrel back across your body horizonally to aim and fire. From both a speed and accuracy comparison to a straight draw it's hot garbage. To paraphrase a poster on a gun forum I was reading when I researched this, \"If you give a guy a Star Wars laser but he has to cross-draw, and another guy an old Colt revolver with a straight draw... my money's still on the second guy.\"\n\nSo when I saw the Man in Black nonchalantly take his time to shoot Teddy in ep1, I thought \"Wow. How confident is this dude in his God Mode powers that he gives that few fucks about drawing his gun?\" I was curious if it was on purpose or not as a character choice, so after I finished watching the first 5 episodes normally I went back and rewatched them all to see how everyone else on the show did it.  What do I mean by everyone?\n\n[*Everyone.*](http://i.imgur.com/9gaSC.gif)\n\nHere are my results checking **every single visible guest or host** as of ep5, Contrapasso.\n\nAside from the Man in Black, 4* other characters use the cross-draw.\n\n- [Hector Escaton](http://i.imgur.com/C2fQYe0.jpg)\n- [Armistice](http://i.imgur.com/JOHfxRz.jpg)\n- [Ashley Stubbs](http://i.imgur.com/d0Ked1Y.jpg)\n- [This Guy that Teddy and his Ladyguest Sidekick shoot](http://i.imgur.com/zvucCGX.jpg)\n- [*This lineless asshole who abruptly disappears in the middle of the scene (I don't count this guy)](http://i.imgur.com/WkFdKLK.jpg)\n\nI find it especially interesting that out of the scads of humans/guests who wear guns, only Stubbs and the MiB use this draw. The two men who have absolutely the least to fear from the park, as the MiB is the oldest player and Stubbs has actual Admin cheats.\n\nFor hosts, it's peculiar that aside from that throwaway big doofus who had to draw slowly to get gunned down anyway, the only other two are so directly connected. They're also the most brazen, committing a daylight safe robbery in the middle of town. They might well think that they're invulnerable as well.\n\nOf note is that neither Hector nor Armistice normally use or even pull their pistols, they're normally equipped with a rifle. Armistice has a knife on the right/dominant side and a revolver on her left, so she does essentially a double cross-draw to pull both. Also, in the scene where she's bathing in the river she's [wearing her pistol reversed, handle facing back](http://i.imgur.com/Y957rEs.jpg) as though she's actually left handed. But in the following scene where she kills the informants, [you can see that she shoots with the right hand and pulls the knife with her left](http://i.imgur.com/ystsY5d.jpg). So that's just a continuity error.\n\nA few hosts/guests also wear their holsters on the left, but they're just left-handed and using a straight draw. [You can see those here](http://imgur.com/a/7SVJc).\n\nEveryone else is right handed and uses a straight draw, like they're in a hurry and not trying to die.\n\n- [Dolores](http://i.imgur.com/71swybJ.jpg)\n- [Teddy](http://i.imgur.com/ZBYAFyr.jpg)\n- [William and Logan](http://i.imgur.com/K5GGTUG.jpg)\n- [Lawrence (this one is a push, you can't see the holster but the way he raises the barrel in this scene shows it)](http://i.imgur.com/yl2gvaK.png)\n- [Literally every single other character](http://imgur.com/a/3YNhf)\n\nAnd so we have it. Is there a secret behind the drawing preferences of different characters? Was it a conscious choice by the actors or just a peculiar coincidence? If this is the kind of shit I'm posting now, how bad is it going to get between seasons? All valid questions that I leave you to discuss.\n\n**TL;DR - There are in fact two timelines, Stubbs is clearly the Man in Black, and if you need more evidence than this I don't know what to tell you.**" }

She is physically unresponsive, however.  As the fly crawls over her eye, indicating she is clearly not human, we see her environment reflected in her cornea.  Has anyone with better screen resolution and better eyes than mine been able to decipher what is reflected?\n\n* Referencing the above event: It is Bernard's voice asking the questions.  Later, at the end of the episode, it is Ashley who asks the questions.  The conversations are *nearly* identical.  Are these standard diagnostic/security questions asked of the hosts? Was Bernard, or a facsimile of Bernard, priming Dolores with the questions sometime at an earlier date, so that she'd know the correct answers beforehand and thus save her life?\n\n* Walter, during his off-script freak out/slaughter at the Mariposa, is clearly grievously wounded in the abdomen.  A wound that would have \"killed\" another host, or at least caused them to react as a human would to such trauma.  He seems unfazed, though, and lashes out at \"Arnold.\" \"Not gonna die *this* time, Arnold.\"  There is no Arnold present.  Is he speaking to a voice in his head? Tinfoil Hat:  You can construct \"Arnold\" from the letters in \"Bernard Lowe.\"  Of course, you have W, E, E, R and B left over-  \"Arnold Weber\" or similar?  Or is \"Arnold\" an acronym. R.N.L.D, or similar.  Is Arnold a core program?  Part of a larger operating system?  Is it what is directing Dolores and shows her where the gun is?  She asks \"here?\" when she gets to the place.  Who is she asking?\n\n* The conversation between Sizemore and Theresa on the upper deck of Delos is significant, but few seem to have examined it.  Theresa admits there is a much deeper meaning to the whole project than meets the eye- she even chastises Sizemore for being to stupid to figure it out.\n\n* Sizemore, at one point, states he opinion that Ford will eventually chase his personal demons right off the edge of a cliff, or words to that effect.\n\n* Ford states in Ep.1 that he feels the nature of human evolution has run it's course.  That what they are doing is basically the next step.  That eventually they may be able to resurrect the dead, \"call forth Lazarus from his cave.\"  Does he have issues/ guilt related to some catastrophic fuck up they caused.  The \"catastrauphic failure.\"  Is his end goal to create artificial life, to clone a human and re-install their lost consciousness into a host?\n\n* In Ep. 2, Bernard looks different from what we've seen elsewhere when he is having his private conversation with Dolores:  He seems physically more haggard, hair slightly longer, no glasses, a slumpier wardrobe that his usual more polished coat/tie outfits. No glasses.  Is it really Bernard?  Does this particular conversation happen in a timeframe before Ep. 1.  So far, this is one of the few things I've seen that makes me consider a multiple-time-frame theory.\n\n* Wild stab (more tinfoil hat)- in some conversations within the Delos compound, Theresa is smoking.  In others, she is almost conspicuously not.  She's even smoking in areas where she shouldn't be, Bernard even calls her out on it.  Yet in places where you'd expect her to smoke (like post-coitus in Bernard's quarters) she doesn't smoke.  She seems to enjoy it, but clearly doesn't when you'd think she would.  Did she smoke in the past, then quit later on?  More fuel for the timeframe theorists?  The only evidence I see of time jumping is within the Delos internal scenes.\n\n* Bernard is seen longingly looking at a photo of a child.  He also seems put off when Ashley asks if he has children at home.  He seems to have a painful memory associated with a child.  Tinfoil: The photo has the same ragged appearance and quality as the one Abernathy finds near his corral. " }

People thought that Bach stole the title \"A Well-Tempered Clavier\" from a 1600s manuacript by **Bernhard Weber**, but it seems it was the other way around, because Bernhard was only born in 1712, which meant that not that his manuscript wasn't from the 17th century, but that he was only 10 when Bach wrote the piece.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNow, some people think that Bernard is a host version of Arnold. One of the clues to that is that **Bernard** Lowe is an anagram of Arnold **Weber**. Since we know that some people think of Ford as a thief who stole Arnold's ideas, and we don't know Arnold's last name, is the title of the episode a reference to the relationship the two had, and the name Bernhard Weber is coincidential, or could the name be a clue too?

The name meaning \"The Noose\" references the fact that, if left alone, El Lazo's story always ends with him being hanged. If we were to read into it further, it's even possible that El Lazo himself is trying to use the third meaning of his name, \"The Lasso\", and not referring to either of the other two. \n\nWhat really puts the cherry on top of those 2 or 3 meanings is that \"Lazo\" is also almost certainly a reference to Lazarus, although the meaning behind that beyond the simple fact that he is resurrected is not yet clear. \n\nAfter all that it seems like the show runners should be done with the layered symbolism, but I don't think they are.

{ "subreddit" : "westworld", "title" : "I've figured where and what the maze is!!! And how Kissy's scalping relates to the Blood Arroyo, snake eggs, the Delos headquarters, and constellations.", "text" : "**The Maze in Kissy's Skull:**\n\nThe [maze depicted in Kissy's skull](https://images.moviepilot.com/images/c_limit,h_1000,q_auto,w_710/tzkstkk9qdmknfnpiycq/image-hbo.jpg) is not a 2D map, it's the cross-section of a spherical 3D maze. A maze that looks something like [this](http://www.thinkgeek.com/images/products/zoom/insg_a-maze-balls.jpg), whose cross-section would look like [this](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/5b/a4/45/5ba4457c85c2cb0aefdedf9db44ce329.jpg). Note the long walls with relatively few doorways, the tendency towards concentric rings, and the empty space in the centers. \n\nA 2D maze would be far too simple, considering how hard it is to find in the first place. A 3D maze is fittingly complex. \n\nThis could also explain why multiple hosts are getting scalped - the Man in Black is trying to build a 3D model of the maze from the different angles depicted in each host's skull. \n\n**How the Maze is Hidden:** \n\nWe've already seen that the Delos headquarters is underground, and it would be easy for the creators to similarly carve out a 3D maze in another underground section of rock. Having a giant maze visible through Google Maps would be far too easy for anyone in the future to find. Having the maze underground makes it able to be spherical, as well as nearly undetectable without prior knowledge of where to go. \n\n**Where the Maze is Located:**\n\nThe little girl in episode two says \"Follow the Blood Arroyo to where the snake lays its eggs\". The Blood Arroyo (or \"stream\" in Spanish) is clearly a reference to the big river that runs next to Westworld. But what about the snake? \n\nThe rogue host in episode three that obsessively carved animals before running off *only carved constellations*. How does he have this knowledge, if the assistant programmer has never heard of it being programmed into the hosts? *He has it because it relates to the deeper game. It is a clue that leads to the maze.* \n\nAnd guess what? There's a [northern hemisphere snake constellation, called serpens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpens). The mythology surrounding the snake constellation is that of rebirth. And it is \"unique among the modern constellations in being split into two non-contiguous parts, Serpens Caput (Serpent Head) to the west and Serpens Cauda (Serpent Tail) to the east.\" \n\n\"Where the snake lays its eggs\" directs you to the Serpent's Tail, aka the Serpens Cauda in the east. \n\nFurthermore, guess how constellations are most accurately depicted? [As](http://courses.atlas.illinois.edu/spring2011/astr/astr210/LECTURES/IMAGES/spheroid1.gif) [a](http://www.lpi.usra.edu/education/skytellers/constellations/images/celest_sphere.jpg) [sphere](http://www.ngawhetu.com/Resources/TheRhythmicSky/images/88constels.jpg) [.](http://www.space.com/images/i/000/017/054/original/northern-constellations-sky.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&amp;fit=inside%7C660:*) \n\n[This one](http://www.ngawhetu.com/Resources/TheRhythmicSky/images/88constels.jpg) in particular looks like a [puzzle sphere](http://www.thinkgeek.com/images/products/zoom/insg_a-maze-balls.jpg), doesn't it? \n\nKnowledge of the constellations, specifically the Serpens Cauda, will lead the Man in Black (or Dolores, if the maze is a kind of Turing tests for the hosts) to the right spot along the muddy river where the entrance to the underground maze is located. \n\n-------\n\n**TLDR;** The image in Kissy's skull is a cross-section of a spherical 3D maze that is located underground similar to Delos Headquarters. To find the entrance to the maze, you have to follow the reddish muddy river and locate the entrance using the Serpens Cauda constellation (aka the Serpent Tail). The maze itself may also be a spherical representation of the constellations in the sky around the Earth (aka around Man, like the image in Kissy's skull). \n\n-------\n\nThoughts? \n\n\n-------\n\n**COMMENTS AND EDITS** \n\n*Tons of great discussion down below! While I'm still very sure of my theory's main points (the cross-section of a 3D sphere related to a constellation sphere and the Serpent Cauda), several commenters have made some great points and persuasive arguments of their own. For fairness and open discussion I'm including them below:*\n\n- /u/ArtisanClickbait pointed out that Armistice, the blonde gunslinger with the long snake tattoo, who was also shown as one of the hosts that \"heard the voice of God\" in the most recent episode, might play an important part in upcoming episodes. I don't know much about her, but I'm adding her here in case she's significant. \n- /u/busmans added an interesting corroboration of the rebirth snake mythology by bringing up the [Ouroboros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros) mentioned in the first episode. \n- /u/ShivasRightFoot has an interesting comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/57vlu8/ive_figured_where_and_what_the_maze_is_and_how/d8vewxu?st=iudotqda&amp;sh=50a42da8) about how in mythology Orion travels to the East end of the Earth on a quest to regain his sight and spends time on the island of Delos. \n- /u/SpaceiLLiad and /u/TerryStedman both argued that an \"arroyo\" is not really a river so much as a \"water-carved gully or channel\" that is usually dry until it rains, maybe symbolizing a pathway or a gully that will be filled with blood. The blood could also symbolize something religious, such as the blood of Christ. \n- However! /u/jesuschin brings up a good rebuttal [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/57vlu8/ive_figured_where_and_what_the_maze_is_and_how/d8vtqcn?st=iuelpt6r&amp;sh=ff315710), noting that the creators have already referred to the big river as the \"Red River\" and that Dr. Ford quickly shut down the idea of any plot lines around it, perhaps trying to keep guests from accidentally stumbling onto something they shouldn't. \n- /u/kingcoyote makes a great point [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/57vlu8/ive_figured_where_and_what_the_maze_is_and_how/d8w6jc9?st=iuelwca3&amp;sh=deddddf2) about the changing nature and locations of constellations. \n- And lastly, /u/speider makes the best two points of any of I've read against my theory so far. S/he points out that both the turtle and bear carvings had the same Orion constellation on them, implying that all the figurines pointed to Orion, not the Serpens Cauda. That's a great catch that I completely missed. However, while those figurines may all be pointing to Orion, it would make sense for the Westworld creators to have made a treasure map of sorts, leading from one clue to another, which could easily involve multiple constellations. Secondly, /u/speider brought up a strong argument against the physical 3D maze, which is one I had already been mulling over, and which has convinced me against the existence of a physical 3D maze. S/he asked how walking through the maze would be possible without there somehow being a center of gravity within the maze. I agree, and while I'm *convinced* the image in Kissy's skull is the cross-section of a spherical maze and that it's related to the constellation sphere, I now believe that the spherical imagery and puzzles are steps to solving the maze, and not the layout of the actual maze itself (which is still probably underground).

{ "subreddit" : "westworld", "title" : "I truly think I've just figured out the rest of the season (SPOILERS)", "text" : "First of all, Bernard = a host of Arnold, and the secret interviews with Dolores are really Arnold interviewing Dolores in the past. This makes sense for a lot of reasons (thanks to /u/PorcelainPoppy getting my brainball rolling):\n\n1. Bernard couldn't see the door, so he didn't know that the basement existed, so he couldn't have private conversations with Dolores down there (unless Ford instructed him to then wiped his memory, but in that case why wouldn't Ford just carry them out himself?)\n\n2. Dolores is clothed in those interviews with \"Bernard\". Assuming it's Arnold and the scenes are from the past, it ties perfectly in with Ford flipping out at the tech who put clothes on the host in one of the earlier episodes. My guess is that in a future episode young Ford will find Arnold interviewing a clothed Dolores, freak out and have Arnold killed (young Ford arriving mid-interview will be the big reveal that \"Bernard\" is really just a host copy of Arnold and that the interviews are happening in the past).\n\n3. Also, \"Bernard\" aka Arnold brings up the maze to Dolores in one of their interviews. We already know the maze is Arnold's concoction - it wouldn't make much sense for Bernard (real or Ford's host version) to know about it and prod Dolores to go there. I'm 100% convinced - those interviews are conducted by Arnold in the past.\n\n\nNow, accepting that we're seeing Arnold conduct these interviews in the past, this opens up the \"two timelines\" theory, which I was not a big fan of before last night's episode. In my opinion, William = MiB is 100% TRUE. Here's a breakdown of why, along with the fact that we're accepting there are two timelines in this show thanks to Arnold's interviews with Dolores:\n\n\n1. MiB is a VIP because his family/he has a partial stake in Westworld, which investing in Westworld is Logan and William's primary reason for attending.\n\n2. MiB is obsessed with Dolores because he fell in love with Dolores when he first came to the park as a younger man (as William).\n\n3. MiB is obsessed with the maze because he hears of it from Dolores in the past and wants to be able to give Dolores free will so she can remember their times together and ultimately be together.\n\n\nIn a future episode, I believe that an increasingly self-aware Dolores will confide in William about how she's looking for the maze and how it will \"set her free.\" However, Dolores is killed (possibly by Logan) before they can find the maze. When Dolores is killed, it will become apparent that she is a \"nuts and bolts\" old-school host a la Ford's son. This will be the big reveal that William's storyline has been in the past all along.\n\n\nWilliam will be devasted at her death, and will return to the park / main town to find Dolores, fixed up and good as new. However, her memory will have been completely wiped and she'll have no recollection of the maze / her increasing self-awareness / William. This will crush William, who initially tries to remind Dolores of their times together and her increasing self-awareness, but he fails. He then realizes that he must find the maze himself at any cost to get the Dolores he fell in love with back.\n\n\n**TL;DR** - Bernard = host copy of Arnold, the secret interviews we've seen of \"Bernard\" giving a clothed Dolores are actually Arnold conducting them in the past, Ford finds out and kills Arnold, William = MiB and MiB ultimately wants to find the maze to give Dolores self-awareness." }

{ "subreddit" : "westworld", "title" : "Here's why I stopped believing in the two-timelines idea.", "text" : "Since apparently [we don't care about really analyzing themes or meaning](https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/5avk0v/the_maze_image_is_representative_of_a_brain/) as long as we're fighting about timelines, I might as well weigh in. \n\nI thought at first that the \"two timelines\" idea was right. It seemed like a *brilliant* twist to show the origin story of a villain, and turn someone who introduces himself to the audience as an irredeemable monster into a sympathetic character who started out as a hero. \n\nThe end of episode 3 threw me for a loop. Dolores clearly hallucinates the Man in Black, remembering when he took her into the barn, before she kills the bandit. She then makes her way away from the farmhouse and encounters William and Logan. \n\nNow yes, people will argue this is \"clever editing,\" and that there's no proof that the version of Dolores that encountered them is the same version who saw the MIB. I would say that that is crap, and poor storytelling. \n\nWhen you create a major storyline twist, the audience is willing to give you a certain amount of leeway. The more you try to lie to them, or engage in what I would call \"manipulative editing\" to present things a certain way, the less leeway they'll give you. For every \"The Sixth Sense,\" there's a dozen episodes of \"The Outer Limits\" that failed at that. So let's call Dolores seeing the MIB then meeting William \"Manipulative editing, strike one.\" \n\nStrike two: Stubbs is in the control center when he's informed that Dolores has taken a detour off her loop. He asks if she's with a guest, and it's uncertain, so he tags her to be brought in. Minutes later, we see a man aggressively trying to take Dolores away with him, only meekly retreating when guest William informs him that she's with him. \n\nStubbs is ALSO in the control center when the request comes through for the MIB's two \"pyrotechnic effects\" in the jailbreak and he approves them. To fit these two events into two timelines 30 years apart you need to assume that either a) he doesn't age because they're insane enough to use a Host for the head of security, b) there's a TON or manipulative editing to make you believe that \"Dolores going rogue when Stubbs knows about it\" and \"Dolores going rogue with William\" happen at the same time, or c) Stubbs is actually a Highlander, or longevity technology in the future has gotten REALLY good. So strike two. \n\nStrike three: Dolores' meetings. Again there's a direct link visual link between her being put down by Ford's in the middle of the Day of the Dead parade, and her being brought in for questioning by Ford. Afterward, she tells William that she had \"troubled dreams.\" Once again, it COULD be \"manipulative editing,\" mixing Dolores' past experiences with present ones in an attempt to lie to the audience.\n\nBut I don't believe it. There's only so much lying to the audience that you can do, and still be telling a decent story. And the themes and ideas that Westworld is presenting, the concepts of the mind as a method for exploration and the hosts rising to actual consciousness, those aren't ideas that lend themselves to telling the audience \"You didn't really see what we showed you.\" They're suited to a great adventure talking about the nature of reality, consciousness, and individuality, not \"M. Night Shyamalan.\"\n\nNow, I could be wrong. I could be underestimating how much they think they can get away with in terms of manipulating the audience. I could be OVERestimating how much the writers care about avoiding cliches.\n\nBut I doubt it." }
{ "subreddit" : "westworld", "title" : "[Theory] Very cool theory about the flies and Dolores that I saw on another forum...", "text" : "\"One thing that stuck with me and I've been thinking about the entire day, and which I finally figured out why it stuck with me is the importance of the fly. And I'm not merely talking about the ending scene.\n\nIn the opening scene it's established that the hosts don't react to them as one crawls across Delores' eye.\n\nThen there's the piece of dialogue about how a host could never hurt a human, they couldn't even hurt a fly. This obviously seems like a setup for the ending scene but there's an even more important scene about it, the one where the sheriff starts to malfunction when he's escorting the guests. Because what's important here is what happens precisely before he starts malfunctioning. A fly lands on his face.\n\nWhy is this important? Because of what is being discussed about the hosts in other scenes about the reveries allowing them to pick up small touches/details in human behavior and imitate them so they appear more lifelike, such as the hooker from the saloon rubbing her lips and the sheriff, when fixed, combing his mustache with his fingers. So to bring that back to the fly, what is the most subconscious, instinctive move a person makes when a fly lands on them? They swat it, and I think we all know that we do it without even thinking about it. So what happens when the hosts constantly register the guests doing this? They want to start imitating it, but to do so they would intent on killing the fly, and this goes directly against their core programming. And thus, unaware to the programmers, they have created a paradox in their system, one that is causing them to glitch.\n\nThis brings a lot more meaning to the end scene because it doesn't just mean that Dolores' has somehow overcome the glitch, but this means that her AI is evolved far ahead of the other hosts in the park. And we already know why this is because of what is said about her towards the end, namely that she is the oldest host in the park. Which means she contains more reveries than any other host in the park, the same reveries that stand at the core of the hosts' changing behavior.\n\nSo we really already know why and how she has overcome her programming, and this leads me to theorize that she is in fact so far ahead of the other hosts that she is evolved even far beyond what the programmers think is going on, and that she has been playing along for a while now.\" " }

That one scene totally changed my opinion.  He *does* care about william,  and his sister,  and didn't want him to become disillusioned with reality. \n\nI came to realize Williams obsession with dolores is somewhat akin to the guys that marry a love doll and treat them as a real human. \n\nBecause as real as the hosts seem, this is really all an illusion;  a very clever one capable of tricking most humans,  but an illusion nonetheless.  \n\nPerhaps this is the real moral of the story.  Plenty of film and literature have covered the \"if you make a robot that mimics humans, are they the same as humans? \" concept with the answer being yes,  and only the protagonist is compassionate enough to realize it.  But maybe the truth is no.  They are essentially a recording of a human,  replayed on a human like model.  But while convincing,  they lack the essence of what makes a human *human*. Heart,  sole...true love, the ability to procreate, the ability to die. And I don't think any amount of programming can change that,  regardless of how complex it is. \n\nWhile I don't agree with thinking of a host as totally lifeless,  and that it is somehow okay to do greavious harm due to them, I also think it is unhealthy to think of them as an equivalent,  a replacement even for true humans. Especially since they're programmed to take advantage of human nature.

It's not that I see strong evidence against the theory, but the idea just seems totally random, without purpose, and most importantly without any convincing evidence to support it.\nTo me, it's a kin to someone theorizing that the entire show and everything we've seen is a virtual simulation of a television show being run on the computer a teenage tech prodigy. The kid is a participant in a contest to come up with interesting television shows using state-of-the-art software that allows one to develop tv shows from their bedroom so advanced that they're indistinguishable from a real-life tv show. \nNow one can argue that there's nothing we've seen so far that disproves this theory and, if true, the theory would draw interesting parallels between our real world capabilities to construct artificial realities that are increasingly similar to our actual reality. One could continue to point out reasons as to why the theory makes sense, etc etc.\nWhat an I missing? Why is the multiple timeline theory any more reasonable than the bonkers, out-of-nowhere theory I just concocted?\n\n\n\nEDIT: \n\nDid not expect this get any more than a handful of responses. Lots of interesting points on both ends of the spectrum.\nResponding to some of the recurring themes across replies:\n- Yes, the Nolan brothers are known for plot twists and creative storytelling, sometimes involving multiple timelines. But just because Jonathan Nolan has done the multiple timeframe thing in the past (e.g. Memento) doesn't mean he's a one trick pony. Also, he's gotta know that his audience would sniff out that kind of twist from a mile away, given his prior work, if he were to use it in Westworld, especially being that it's a tv show with ample time between episodes for fans to share ideas and theories.\n- For there to actually be a story, the show must maintain some level logical coherence from scene to scene and plot point to plot point as opposed to maintaining what looks like a story, but is really just a series of tricks to allow for big twist. The point should be to create and tell a story with elements of deception, possibly including major plot twists. Not to create a plot twist with pieces of story stitched together to allow for the twist. That came out as word salad, but I think the gist is there.\n- The logo thing keeps coming up. Really don't see this as compelling evidence for either side. This show had many production hiccups, including numerous reshoots, plot reworkings, recastings, etc. Could the two logos have slipped through production? Sure. Could someone have let it through production to mess with audiences? Sure. Could WW maintain several versions of their logo? Sure. Could this be an earlier logo from a past timeline? Sure. All of these are possibilities so, to me, the logo inconsistency is just too flimsy and easy-to-explain away for it to be considered support for either argument.\n- I didn't intend to express disdain for the two timeframe theory or theorizers. What led me to post this was a series of events that made me wonder if I was the only person still unconvinced of two timeline theory. First I read an episode review that pretty much considered the theory to have been confirmed. Then I listened to a podcast where it was also suggested that the theory had essentially been confirmed. Then I came to the subreddit and saw numerous posts where people claimed to be convinced and have more evidence supporting the theory. So I was honestly starting to wonder if anyone else was in the same boat as me. Ultimately, I will be happy with whatever direction the show takes, as long as the storyline makes sense once everything is revealed.\n\nEDIT#2: Thanks everyone who contributed ideas to this (mostly) rich discussion. It's awesome that we have a platform enabling us to more or less watch tv shows together and then log on to exchange ideas, theories, etc. So many interesting points have been raised supporting both perspectives so I've decided to rewatch the first half of the season, as I've only seen each episode once and am usually folding laundry while watching (Sunday = laundry night :-/ ). Watching it after reading through this thread will definitely add an interesting element of vigilance to the experience.\n\nEDIT#3:\nI followed through in rewatching all 5 episodes with the two timeliner arguments in the forefront on my mind. I must say, after the first 2 episodes, I was convinced that there were two timelines. There was a solid amount of dialogue that subtly hinted at both the existence of two timelines and William being a younger MiB, and the different logos did look to support two timelines after rewatching, which I has previously written off as a reach. However, after continuing my rewatch with the next 3 episodes, I found it impossible to continue believing these theories, as there is quite a lot of contradictory material in these eps. One additional observation, after rewatching I'm convinced Logan is the board member in the park. \nAnyway, I'm glad I rewatched. I now much better understand where people are coming from in suggesting two timelines, especially in the first two episodes, but just can't hold onto that theory beyond episode 3. All in all, looking forward to seeing the rest of the season unfold and eager to see which theories turn out to be true." }

A '5' means you're clumsy as hell; a '15' means you're a natural athlete.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer that, for a given trait...\n\n* 1-5 is deficient.\n* 6-10 is average.\n* 11-15 is above average.\n* 16-19 is superlative, and\n* a 20 is superhuman.\n\nIt was kind of tough to make out some of the traits and numbers. Fortunately, the CGI people gave us those handy-dandy concentric circles, so it's possible to simply count each stat number.\n\nSo! Going clockwise as per the Matrix, here are Maeve's original stats, along with what she upgraded herself to:\n\n    Candor - 19 (unchanged)\n    Vivacity - 17 (unchanged)\n    Coordination - 10 -&gt; 20 (MAXED)\n    Meekness - 2 (unchanged)\n    Humility - 3 (unchanged)\n    Cruelty - 1 -&gt; 10 (ruh roh!)\n    Self-Preservation - 10 -&gt; 20 (MAXED)\n    Patience - 3 (unchanged)\n    Decisiveness - 14 -&gt; 20 (MAXED)\n    Imagination - 13 -&gt; 20 (MAXED)\n    Curiosity - 8 -&gt; 13\n    Aggression - 5 -&gt; 20 (MAXED)\n    Loyalty - 16 -&gt; 10 (The only stat that was overtly reduced)\n    Empathy - 9 (unchanged)\n    Tenacity - 17 -&gt; 20 (MAXED)\n    Courage - 15 -&gt; 20 (MAXED)\n    Sensuality - 18 (unchanged)\n    Charm - 18 (unchanged)\n    Humor - 9 (unchanged)\n    Bulk Apperception (General Intelligence) - 14 -&gt; 20 (MAXED)\n\nAdditionally, thanks to [this capture,](http://imgur.com/XsucF5L) we have another set of traits. They don't have numerical values, because we can't see the matrix for them, but it does say whether they are \"Standard,\" \"Modified,\" or MAXED out due to being listed in red.\n\nHere is the second set of traits, organized by how they were changed:\n\n    **Unchanged, aka, Standard:**\n    Emotional Acuity\n    Egocentrism\n    Timidity\n    Wanderlust\n    Temperance\n    Gentleness\n\n    **Changed:**\n    Sociopathy\n    Brazenness\n    Sarcasm\n    Integrity\n    Peacefulness (probably reduced)\n    Reserve\n\n    **MAXED:**\n    Grit\n    Perseverence\n\n**Commentary**\n\nI am truly in awe of the level of thought and detail that went into Maeve's character, and these scenes. HBO really, really thought about what Maeve's two Character Sheets should be, and took great care to synchronize them with how she comes across in her scenes.\n\nThe first Character Sheet paints the picture of a romanticized heroine: candid, vivacious, sensual,  fiercely loyal to her girls, tenacious and courageous. She isn't meek or humble; fitting of a whore. And yet, neither is she cruel nor aggressive. Fairly smart.\n\nAll of these things made me fall in love with Maeve's original character. After all, she is admirable and likable.\n\nThe second character sheet shows us something much more impressive, and honestly, much, much scarier.\n\n* Physically, she is a fucking ninja, with superhuman coordination.\n* Mentally, she is a God: superhuman intelligence, decisiveness, tenacity, imagination, courage, grit, and perseverance.\n* Morally, she's Lady Macbeth: reduced loyalty, maxed-out aggression, with enhanced brazenness and sociopathy.\n* Plus, she still has 18's in Charm and Sensuality.\n\nShe strikes me as something akin to a female James Bond, capable of charming, outsmarting, fighting, or fucking her way through any situation. This is exactly what we saw in episode 9.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen, I think we've found our Joan of Arc for the incoming Robot Revolution.\n\nOn a speculative side note, I wonder if she'll similarly trick out her new partner in crime, the Bandit. Can't wait for next Sunday!" }

William thought that Dolores was alive until the moment he returned to Sweetwater and she was back on her loop.

I was pretty convinced you guys were crazy and that the whole Stubbs/“Dolores off her loop” thing was the nail in the coffin.\n\nBut obviously the tide has turned. At this point, it’s pretty difficult to argue that the logo discrepancy isn’t intentional. William’s comments about the park in the last episode do seem to eerily echo the MiB’s philosophy, etc. I’m forced to admit I was an asshole skeptic and you guys were probably onto something.\n\nAt this point, I have to admit that I’m tentatively on Team Two Lines (which if you look at my comment history, you’ll realize how painful this is to admit!), but I think more than that, I’ve realized the silliness of picking a “team” in the first place.\n\nIn retrospect, it was dumb of me to have seen this whole thing as an issue with “sides.” We’re all a bunch of fans geeking out over an awesome show.

Not just because you might end up looking like a fool when you’re proven wrong, but also because it detracts from the discussion and your overall enjoyment of the show by forcing you to root for a specific plot that confirms your position rather than just rooting for the best story that the filmmakers can tell.\n\nWhatever does happen, this show has been so rad, Nolan is such a consummate story teller, and the Bernard reveal was so awesome last week (even in spite of the fact that we all suspected it from a ways off), that whatever happens I know we’re going to be in good hands. And I’m looking forward to sitting back and enjoying the ride with everyone, freed from the prison of taking sides!

{ "subreddit" : "westworld", "title" : "Key takeaways from episode 4", "text" : "1) ARNOLD IS REAL\nSome have theorized that Arnold was simply invited by Ford for one reason or another, perhaps to use as a warning to Bernard. Tonight confirmed beyond a reasonable doubt that Arnold did in fact exist, and he likely did indeed die in the park. The Man in Black discussed how Arnold created a world where you can't die, but broke his own rule. He says Arnold had one last story to tell with higher stakes and violence, and his goal was to fulfill Arnold's legacy by finding the center of the maze. This story coincides with what Ford told Bernard in episode 3, and Ford's conversation with Theresa about Arnold also substantiates the fact that he did indeed exist.\n\n2) THE MAN IN BLACK IS A GOOD GUY IN REAL LIFE\nFor the first time we received a clue about who the Man in Black is outside of Westworld. Another guest comes up to him and says \"I'm such an admirer of yours. Your foundation literally saved my sister's life\" before promptly being interrupted by the Man in Black. It's a small but significant clue. We always assumed the Man in Black was wealthy due to his extremely expensive, annual Westworld visits. Now we know that has has some sort of foundation--perhaps tied to funding some sort of medical research--which implies he's a likely a good person in real life.\n\n3) MORE CLUES THAT BERNARD MAY BE A HOST\nWe get a few more hints in this episode that Bernard may be a host. The first comes from the opening scene with Dolores. She tells him she doesn't want to forget about her mother and father being killed because \"It's all I have left of them.\" This is identical to the language used by Bernard in episode 3 when discussing the death of his son with his ex-wife. The other key clue comes from Ford's conversation with Theresa, where he tells her--and I'm quoting from memory here--\"I do hope you're gentle with Bernard. He has a sensitive disposition.\" Ford pronounces \"Bernard\" almost sarcastically and smiles when he says it. This is possibly because Bernard is a host, though I certainly think there's still reasonable doubt to say the least.\n\n4) MORE HOLES IN THE WILLIAM/MIB TIMELINE\nThere is definitely significant evidence to suggest that William's timeline takes place in the past, and perhaps he is an early version of the Man in Black. Critics of this theory gain new evidence tonight. At the end of episode 3, Dolores runs from her ranch into the arms of William. This alone suggests that the William storyline is concurrent with Dolores gaining consciousness. In this episode we see the the modern-day Delos employees discuss Dolores being \"off her loop,\" and try unsuccessfully to bring her back to the ranch. Another host tells her she needs to get back to her father, but Dolores says her father is dead. All this leads us to believe that there is only one timeline. Of course, Dolores' flashbacks and general disorientation means all of this could be in her mind, including her journey with William. But if not, it disproves the theory that William becomes the Man in Black.\n\n5) OTHER HOSTS ARE ALSO RETAINING MEMORIES (OR THERE'S A NEW NARRATIVE)\nAs Maeve seeks to remember her run in with the Westworld mechanical repair shop, we learn that many other hosts at least have some memories of their encounters as well. When the young girl drops a doll of one of the red-masked me and Maeve picks it up, another hosts tells her that the dolls are \"part of their religion.\" While other hosts view these mysterious masked men as deity, it still implies that they at least remember them. Hector also tells Maeve in the final scene that it's a \"blessing\" to see the \"masters.\" On the other hand, as some have noted, this may simply be part of the new narrative that Ford created. Therefore, they may not actually remember the hazmat suit men, but instead are simply programed to do so.\n\n6) THE CHURCH IS VIEWED AS THE HOSTS' POINT OF CREATION\nThe role of religion weighs heavily on this episode, though there are lots of questions left to be answered. We know from the last episode that the steeple is central to Ford's new narrative, and it is also tied heavily to the maze. In all likelihood, it's actually the entrance to the maze. In this episode, Dolores asks Lawrence's daughter where she is from, and she says \"The same place as you. Don't you remember?\" Then Dolores has a flashback of the church. This also interplays with the bicameral mind theory that the voices hosts are hearing come from the Gods, and Ford even mentions to Theresa that he and Arnold viewed themselves as such upon creating the park. A lot going on here, but we're starting to piece together what role the church plays here.\n\n7) THE CARVING ON THE ROCK ISN'T ORION (SUPPOSEDLY)\nI'm not quite sure what to make of this yet, but Bernard does tell Elsie that the carving she's obsessing over on the rock is not Orion because this formation has four stars and Orion has three. He could have ulterior motives here that we just don't yet know, or the formation isn't Orion. There's also another reference to the sky when Dolores looks up at the moon in one of the scenes with William. Again, not sure what this all signifies yet.\n\nOk, I'm about to rewatch the episode again. I'm sure I'll pick up on more things, but these were my key initial takeaways. Thoughts?" }

Then the host walks away, presumably never to return to that spot.\n\nIn Episode 3, he did the same thing to Bernard. \"You'll tell me if you notice anything unusual with the hosts, won't you?\" Then Bernard stops what he's doing, says yes, and leaves. \n\nYes, we later see Bernard talking to his ex-wife about their son, but after all of the fuss about backstory in this episode, I found it suspicious. The wife could easily be just another host/AI to keep Bernard's backstory consistent if he ever starts asking questions. We've seen firsthand how easily a backstory can become reality for a host (Teddy and the new Wyatt storyline), and one of the main questions asked during diagnostics is, \"Have you ever noticed any inconsistencies in your world?\"\n\nSo, what do you think?

He was speaking to God, in the sense that he was trying to more fully understand and develop consciousness itself. This strongly implies that Teddy is Ford in this story, and that Ford had (has?) to hunt Arnold down and stop him and his dangerous ideas.\n\nAlso, the episode is called \"the Stray,\" which could refer to the lumberjack, Wyatt, Arnold, or all three.\n\nI just didn't pick up on this the first time and knowing this turned Teddy's plot in the episode from mindless robot action to something much more intriguing.

{ "subreddit" : "westworld", "title" : "I rewatched the pilot for the fourth or fifth time. Picked up on a ton of small details I hadn't before. We learn a lot more in the first episode than I thought.", "text" : "Hey guys. So, as the title says, going back and watching the pilot for the fourth or fifth time after having watched the third episode two or three times as well, I picked up on a few crucial things that potentially reveal a lot about the story going forward. I'm going to try my best to keep this as short and simple as possible, but I don't know how easy that's going to be. \n________________________________________\n\n**Ford knows he screwed up bad in the pilot. The Abernathy Scene.**\n\nWhen I first watched the scene where Ford \"interviews\" Abernathy, I got the impression that Ford was pretty confident with himself. He wasn't too concerned about anything. Upon rewatching it, I don't think my initial impression could've been any more wrong. \n\nFord is positively shaken when Abernathy \"goes off script.\" His eyes say it all at first. But it's everything else he does once Bernard and the others come in to disable Abernathy that gives it away. Ford is *very quick* to get up and leave the room. It is sudden; not the reaction of a man who isn't concerned by what he just saw. \n\nAnd the *first thing* Ford says after Abernathy is shut off is *\"Shakespeare...\"*. Ford latches onto the line Abernathy delivers just before he's disabled, something to the effect of, \"the horrors of the Earth,\" which is of course a Shakespeare quote. *This* is what Ford focuses on; the fact that the host delivers a Shakespeare quote. Ford finds it peculiar. \n\nThen Ford tries to explain it away by suggesting it was part of Abernathy's previous programming as a cannibal. However, once again, upon rewatching the scene, this seems more like Ford desperately trying to rationalize Abernathy's behavior to himself rather than to his employees; like he's trying to make himself remain calm. He then hastily leaves the room.\n\nFord is worried about what he just saw. He is shaken. He knows he messed up, and now his past is going to come back to haunt him.\n\n_______________________________________\n\n**The reveries that Ford programmed into the hosts were taken from something Arnold created/wrote, and they are planting the seeds of consciousness in the hosts.** ------- **See EDIT Below**\n\nThat scene between Ford and Abernathy potentially says a lot after we've seen episode three and Ford's story about Arnold. I propose that the reveries Ford programmed were something he took from code Arnold wrote when he was trying to attain actual consciousness in the hosts. Ford did not anticipate this code or section of code to cause the hosts to start \"awakening,\" as Arnold hoped they would. Ford likely thought this isolated piece of Arnold's work alone wouldn't cause the hosts to start \"waking up,\" but he was wrong. In truth, *this* is the mistake he is referencing when Bernard comes to see him. Including any part of Arnold's work was his real mistake. He is starting to realize how seriously he may have just fucked up.\n\n_______________________\n\n**This explains Ford's behavior in episode three in front of the \"new guy\" and his repeated insistence that the hosts are not real.**\n\nWhen I first watched episode three, I was a little bit jarred by how Ford is portrayed in the first two episodes. He comes off as a bit *colder* to everyone else around him. Upon rewatching the scene, I payed close attention to Bernard's reaction when Ford cuts the host's cheek to demonstrate to the new guy that the hosts aren't real. *Bernard looks surprised/puzzled.* This strongly suggests Ford has not acted this way before; that this is the first time Bernard -- his protege -- has seen Ford behave like this.\n\nWhy now? Why would Ford only *now* begin to behave like this? Likewise, when Ford insists to Bernard that he not make the mistake of believing the hosts are real, Bernard acts as though it is strange Ford would bring this up, indicating he has never brought it up or thought of it as an issue in the several years Bernard has already worked under him. Why is Ford so concerned with everyone's belief that the hosts aren't real all of a sudden?\n\n*Because Ford knows the reveries -- Arnold's code -- is likely going to cause some or all of the hosts to start becoming conscious. He is trying to influence people's perceptions before that happens -- really make them firm in their beliefs that the hosts are just things rather than living beings.*\n\n__________________________________\n\n**The \"series preview\" after the pilot paints Ford in a very different light, and gives us a strong hint at the MiB's relationship to Arnold.**\n\nThree lines jump out at me the most in the \"series preview\" after the pilot ends. In order, they are,\n\n1) *The hosts are free. Here, under my control.* - Ford\n\n- Ford delivers this line with some authority. We do not know who he is speaking to, but the context seems pretty clear. Someone (Bernard?) has either discovered that the hosts *can* be conscious and free or are seeking out consciousness and freedom in some way, and he is telling Ford about it. Ford is clearly not a fan of this idea, and insists the hosts are free at Westworld, *under his control.* This would certainly hint at the nature of Ford's relationship with Arnold. Arnold wanted the hosts to be conscious and free. Ford didn't. Ford *really, really* didn't want that. What lengths did Ford go to in order to ensure that?\n\n2) *\"Someone else was trying to make something beautiful here; purer.\"* - MiB, paraphrased\n\n- I can't recall the exact line, but this is the gist of the what the MiB says in one clip. Again, we don't know who he is speaking to, but it seems pretty clear the MiB is talking about Arnold. However, given the particular words he used, it also seems clear he doesn't know who exactly Arnold was, the specifics of what Arnold was trying to do, or generally the conflict that arose between Arnold and Ford. The MiB simply knows *someone else* once tried to make Westworld \"something more,\" than what it currently is, and he wants to find out what that is.\n\n3) *\"I've died a thousand times. I'm great at it. How many times have you died?\"* - Maeve (paraphrased)\n\n- Again, we don't know who Maeve is speaking to when she says this, but considering she's in her madame/Westworld character outfit, it seems as though she is saying this to a guest or perhaps a park employee coming to check up on her. It obviously indicates the hosts are becoming *very* aware of who and what they are and what their current \"world\" is meant to be. A huge conflict is in the works here.\n\n________________________\n\n**What I think this says about the plot going forward/TL;DR**\n\nFord is the antagonist here. Arnold succeeded in figuring out how to give the hosts true consciousness, but it went against everything Ford and the company wanted to do with the tech. I can't say how Arnold died (though we will find out, I'm sure), but it wasn't an accident. Ford suggested as much; the question is whether Ford was involved in Arnold's death.\n\nArnold was the true pioneer and genius behind this technology, not Ford. Sure, Ford had a big part in making it possible, but it was Arnold who really pushed it forward. Arnold developed things that Ford could never hope to create. One of those things were the \"reveries,\" that Ford programs into the hosts at the beginning of the series. The reveries were taken from something Arnold created that Ford wanted to use to help keep things \"fresh,\" and \"exciting,\" at the park. Perhaps Ford wanted to prove to everyone he was still relevant to this company; that they needed to keep him around because he could do things with this technology that no one else could. However, Ford fucked up. The reveries code alone was enough to start \"waking up\" hosts with certain triggers. Ford made a mistake.\n\nRemember, Ford immediately latched onto the Shakespeare quote after he \"interviewed\" Abernathy. What does Ford tell Teddy when he gives him a backstory in episode three? *\"A coward dies a thousand deaths, but the valiant taste death but once.\"* Another Shakespeare quote. **Ford found the Shakespeare quote from Abernathy peculiar because Arnold was fond of Shakespeare. Ford was shaken because by quoting Shakespeare, it confirmed that Arnold's code is causing the hosts to become conscious and/or Arnold is somehow living on through the hosts.** \n\nI could probably keep going, but this post is long enough as it is. Just some things I've gathered after rewatching these first three episodes a few times.\n____________________\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nAlternatively, Ford may indeed have written the reveries himself. However, the reveries were something either exactly like or extremely similar to something Arnold had already created. Thus, when Ford programmed the reveries into the hosts, he unknowingly provided a key component for them to attain consciousness, triggering something in them that had long since been dormant.\n_____________________\n\n**EDIT 2: The Bonus Observation**\n\nWith the strong and rather obvious black hat/white hat symbolism on this show, I wanted to add that the dynamic between William and Logan mirrors the dynamic between Arnold and Ford. Recall that Ford has been shown wearing a black hat. Unfortunately, Arnold is dead, so the show hasn't decided to show us Arnold's corpse conveniently wearing a white hat (or a flashback, at least not yet). The black hat worn by Ford is enough, though. Likewise, William wears a white hat (his choice of a white hat was deliberately, blatantly highlighted) and Logan wears a black hat.\n\nNext, consider the dynamic between William and Logan with regards to the hosts. William practically sees them as real. Logan sees them as things. William apologize for bumping into the host after they get off the train. Logan gives him a kind *fuck you.* William tries to help the elderly host off the ground. Logan says *fuck that*. William is willing to hear the elderly host out. Logan stabs him with a knife. William insists the host's terror was real. Logan disagrees.\n\nFurther, I think William's refusal to sleep with the hosts speaks to how he views them as real. We are given hints that in this world, most people don't necessarily consider sleeping with the hosts to be cheating on your spouse. Sizemore says something to that effect. Logan clearly doesn't mind that his sister's fiance can fuck as many hosts as he wants. He encourages it, in fact, and hints that his sister did the same when she went there. However, William sees it differently. He thinks it would be cheating on his fiance *because he thinks of them as real.* I'm sure he's going to end up falling in love with Dolores, who will be the first host to attain consciousness and actually become real.\n\nThis is remarkably similar to the Arnold/Ford dynamic. Arnold wanted the hosts to be real. Ford didn't. Arnold wanted them to be actual, living beings. Ford wanted them to remain *things*. \n\nThus, will William meet the same fate as Arnold? Will Logan be involved, especially if William falls for a host who is becoming \"real?\" I think it seems inevitable that William will aid Dolores in whatever it is she must do and help her evade the park employees/security. It will become a point of division between William and Logan." }

{ "subreddit" : "westworld", "title" : "As a gamer, watching Westworld was especially thought-provoking.", "text" : "I really enjoyed the pilot of this show, and as a gamer I was especially interested in how it seemed to directly be riffing on gamer/dev behavior. As my wife put it after the episode, \"its like a bunch of Red Dead Redemption NPC's woke up and decided to get revenge on the player.\"\n\n\n\n\nI get the sense that this take seems to be very intentional: early in the episode, one of the guests discusses how on his last visit he did a \"straight evil playthrough\" in much the same way I might \"do a Renegade playthrough\" in Mass Effect. Ed Harris' character seems to the hosts like a terrifying villain...but from his perspective he's just trying to unlock achievements and hidden content in a game he's played through a million times over. The park's lead writer painstakingly crafts a villain's dramatic monologue, only to be frustrated when an overeager guest just shoots the villain mid-speech (a problem many an open-world game designer has surely wrestled with in one form or another). \n\n\n\nIts too early in the show to definitively state what the show's larger point is (other than: enslaving and torturing AI's for entertainment is bad), but as a gamer I thought it was pretty thought-provoking TV. The park's guests in the show don't see themselves as \"evil\" in any real sense. They aren't shooting real people, they're shooting elaborate animatronics set up to mimic real people. Any damage done will be erased by the next day. So why not just indulge their darker impulses, do a Renegade playthrough, get that 5-star wanted level? Westworld raises the question of how good AI has to get before this justification no longer holds water...and whether, once that bridge had been crossed, we'd even notice.\n\n\nAs someone who has done multiple RDR playthroughs, including an \"evil\" one, it definitely got me thinking. The show's audience is immediately made to sympathize with the hosts and regard the guests as somewhere between boorish buffoons and total monsters. \"What sociopathic assholes they are.\" But from the guests' perspective, is it really any different than just killing an annoying NPC in Skyrim or going on a rampage in GTA? Or, to use a less \"virtual\" example, if someone jokingly punched one of those annoying musical animatronic at Chuck E. Cheese, at worst we'd call it property damage...and the \"animatronics\" at Westworld, unlike the ones at Chuck E. Cheese, are expressly designed for that sort of treament. \n\n\n\n\"Its ok for someone to do evil shit in video games, because they aren't real. It can even be a healthy outlet--if someone's feeling pissed off, far better they go gun down demons in Doom than lash out in the real world\" is a sentiment expressed in one form or another by many, many gamers (including myself). The mentality of the guests in Westworld is exactly the same, and while we the audience know they're wrong, the guests don't. To The Man in Black, what he's doing is really no different from someone trying to max out their stars in GTA, or trying out an evil Bioware playthrough after having played a game for years. No one is actually being hurt in any real way, the hosts are just a mashup of video game npcs and lifelike realdolls, and by the next day any \"damage\" one had done will be totally erased. From the guests' perspective, whats' the harm, right? Its a mentality that should be very familiar to anyone whose ever played video games that give you license to behave badly or mistreat NPC's (I also like that this show isn't just putting us, the audience, under this critical lens. Its also doing the same thing to the creators. The writer character in particular feels like a direct metacommentary on game developers). \n\n\n\nIn a way, its sort of the classic Turing Test issue. How do you know if a robot is \"really\" sentient, or just presenting a perfect fascimile of sentience? The park's been running for decades. As we saw with \"Old Bill\", the older models were more obviously inhuman in their movements and speech. Well-crafted NPC's, but not actually \"people\". With each generation and update since then they've become progressively more lifelike, more human-seeming in their presentation. But for the park's guests and employees, its all just advancing along the same continuum, of making things that look and sound like real thinking, living beings, but are actually just well-scripted animatronics. As far as the guests are aware, any \"agency\" or \"self-awareness\" is just one more part of the script.\n\n\n\nIn our own world, how advanced and convincing would a video game NPC's AI need to become before we were prepared to give it \"human rights\"? Is there even such a point? I'm not sure there is...\n\n\n\nBasically, gamers pretty regularly treat NPC's in ways that would be monstrous if they were actual people. At the same time, each generation of games seems developers working harder to develop more convincing NPC's with more fleshed out dialogue and characterization, a broader and more in-depth range of responses to potential player actions, etc. Westworld simply carries both of these patterns forward to its logical conclusion--that if, at some point, a game dev actually did develop real artificial intelligence (whether on purpose or by accident), players would be so conditioned to see NPC thoughts and emotions as \"fake\" that we wouldn't even notice, and would carry on being bastards until NPC's somehow got the agency to resist.\n\n\n\nUsually when media tries to comment on video game morality, its hamhanded and clunky and Tipper Gore-esque. \"Playing violent games will make you a school shooter\" type nonsense. Westworld is really the first show I've ever seen that has made me ask myself tough questions about my favorite hobby.\n\n" }

Arnold also creates Ford's \"host family\" that Ford keeps secret.\n\n* The church in Escalante with the hidden bunker is used as a secret meeting place for Arnold. We see old hosts sitting in the church that have reacted badly to the \"voices in their head\" - Arnold's voice. Dolores is the only one that doesn't react badly and hence, is a perfect candidate for Arnold to mention the \"Maze\" to when she is ready, in an attempt to find the 'Bicameral Mind' i.e. the top layer of his consciousness theory.\n\n* Dolores meets with Arnold alone in secret on several occasions in the bunker. Arnold mentions the \"Maze\" to her after several meetings.\n\n* Dolores at some point kills Arnold in the bunker, as well as other hosts in Escalante and elsewhere (possibly under command by Ford following a disagreement/dispute with Arnold) \n\n* Ford buries the town of Escalante to cover up the incident \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**30 years ago (approx)....**\n\n* William and Logan enter the park and encounter Dolores (30 years ago)\n\n* William and Logan go off on a bounty hunt narrative\n\n* Dolores returns to the ranch as per her usual narrative, and finds it under attack (as always happens when she returns at night). Instead of confronting Rebus (the gang leader), she flees on her horse and finds William and Logan's camp, already deviating from her narrative.\n\n* Dolores joins them on the bounty hunt. Dolores, William and Logan travel to Pariah.\n\n* William betrays Logan and runs away with Dolores on the train\n\n* William and Dolores find Escalante (the church town) - it's still buried from five years earlier\n\n* Logan captures William and Dolores \n\n* Logan shows William the photograph of William's fiancé (Juliet), Logan's sister \n\n* Dolores escapes from Logan after he stabs her, confirming she is an older host with mechanical internals\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**20+ years ago (approx)...**\n\n* Ford makes a host version of Arnold and calls him Bernard. No exact dates, but various quotes by Bernard and Ford suggest Bernard has been around at least 15 to 20+ years. Ford also looks noticeably younger in the flashback of him creating Bernard.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**1-1.5 years ago...**\n\n* Maeve (in a previous role) and her daughter are killed by the MiB. Maeve is recommisioned in a different role.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Present/most recent events...**\n\n* Teddy kills Rebus and his bandits who are attacking Dolores' ranch. The MiB appears, kills Teddy and asks Dolores if she remembers him. The MiB drags Dolores into the barn.\n\n* Dolores' father, Peter Abernathy, finds the old, buried photograph of William's fiancé Juliet - which sets off the chain of events involving Dolores hearing Arnold's voice, being more self-aware etc - it's possible she has a distant memory of the photograph when Logan showed it to William when they were captured 30 years ago.\n\n* The host playing Dolores' father (Peter Abernathy) is decommisioned due to his glitches caused by seeing the photograph. He is replaced with a different host.\n\n* Dolores hears Arnold's voice in her head telling her to \"remember\". She finds the gun buried near the ranch.\n\n* In a repeat of the ranch attack narrative, Rebus and his gang kill Dolores' father. Rebus drags Dolores to the barn. Dolores hears Arnold's voice telling her to \"kill him\". Dolores then shoots Rebus with the gun she found buried earlier.\n\n* Ford digs up and rebuilds the buried church/town (Escalante) for his new narrative.\n\n* Dolores feels compelled (after hearing Arnold's voice and experiencing several flashbacks from her past) to travel to Escalante, which has since been rebuilt by Ford. She *subconsciously* retraces the route that her and William took in the past.\n\n* She remembers the church in her flashbacks from 35 years ago, and remembers how to gain access to the secret bunker where she used to meet Arnold.\n\n* Dolores finds the bunker empty, but seeing it makes her remember her meetings in there with Arnold and starts to put the pieces together in her head - eventually figuring out that she killed Arnold - we then see her memory of all of the items in the bunker scattered around, possibly evidence of a disturbance in the bunker. *She doesn't actually meet \"Bernard\" at any point - being in the bunker actually prompts her to remember meeting Arnold 35 years ago and eventually remembering she killed him.*\n\n* Dolores leaves the bunker, and hears something which prompts her to say William's name. The MiB then enters the church.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI'm sure I'm missing lots, but that's as I understand it. \n\nAlso, I think when Dolores encountered the MiB at the ranch/barn, it subconsciously made her recall William (even though she doesn't know that MiB=William yet), and that sets off the chain of events, hearing Arnold's voice again etc along with the incident with her father showing her the photograph of William's fiancé (maybe she has a distant memory of this when she was captured).\n\n**EDIT 1:** as u/jewishbrick pointed out - Dolores and Bernard *never actually meet* in the bunker. When we see her enter the bunker at the end of the episode, she is just remembering Arnold and killing him, Bernard is never physically there.\n\n**EDIT 2:** as u/FalconLorenzo and u/BarbarianStreisand pointed out, there are a few references suggesting Bernard had been around a lot longer than \"recently\". Doesn't make any difference to the order of events, but I've updated it anyway.\n\n**EDIT 3:** Added the incident a year prior to current events where the MiB killed Maeve and her daughter (thanks to u/prism1234)\n" }

So many people complain that their actions are unrealistic, and \"why they wouldn't just turn Maeve in at some point?\".\n\nWhat I have observed is that this is absolutely possible in a large company. All you need is three things:\n\n1. A couple of idiots - there are lots of those. I was once one of those.\n1. The idiots to believe that if you manage to hide the problem long enough, someone else will notice *independently* and fix the problem without blaming them. (Large companies tend to get this.)\n1. That if they get caught nobody will care, and they're just going to get blamed and fired, so they better put most of their effort into covering up. Again, large company.\n\nThe whole idea that they would do something for 'the good of everyone else' is silly. Their assumption would be that someone else would catch it long before it became a real problem, and if it didn't that was the company's fault for not putting in better safety/security standards. Or it's the company's fault for not paying them enough, or giving them enough responsibility, or whatever. It couldn't possibly be *their* fault.\n\nTo give some background, I have worked in a variety of labs for both large and small companies. Story time.\n\nJeff constantly broke stuff. It was a major mining company, as a new employee I was just told to never work in the same room as him by my 'buddy' who was supposed to show me the ropes. He left $1000 tubes lying on counters where they would roll off and smash on the floor, he backed the truck into the loading dock and managed to break the mass spec more than once. Management was unable to fire him, and he created enough doubt that newer employees inevitably got the final blame. I think the managers kind of knew - he never got promoted either - but he seemed otherwise untouchable.\n\nIn another lab, where a particle accelerator was used to make novel radioactive drugs for testing on people and animals, there were multiple security protocols for radiation safety. Badges, suiting up and glove protocols, a testing machine to see if you missed any spots so you could wash it off, and another very sensitive machine that would alarm the building if anyone still managed to walk out radioactive. Joe came to me for help, because he'd managed to contaminate his entire finger and it wasn't going to die down until morning. I helped scrub but nothing seemed to work and I naively assumed he then went and got some professional help. Nope. Apparently, there was a secret unalarmed emergency exit he knew about. Not going home and exposing everyone else to his radiation, even if he wasn't worried about his own health, wasn't much of a priority for him.\n\nLastly, as a very young man in my first real job, I managed to blow up a fume hood by doing something very very stupid (hey I don't need to order this chemical from no stinkin' store! I'll *make it* myself!). Nobody noticed, and I managed to spend the next month slowly cleaning it up and fixing it until everything was back to normal (it involved heavy staining and light physical damage rather than anything permanent).\n\nI've been in a lab where mutagenic chemicals for bacteria were removed from locked down labs and then mysteriously re-appear and project leads who get up to funky experiments after hours. Most security is security theatre internally; it is very very hard to protect yourself from people who have been around long enough to know how everything works.\n\nNot only do I find S&amp;F believable, I'm positive I've worked with them.\n\nIf this was a *small* company then these objections would make more sense. In a small company you often know that your actions not only matter, your actions are essential to its success. In a large company people are treated more like replaceable cogs, so they act far more selfishly." }

He tries bootstrapping consciousness through the bicameral mind. He acts as a preacher adressing the voice of God in the White Church.\n\n- Dolores attends many of the 'Church services' together with a few other hosts (we see her entering the church and leaving it in two of her flashbacks).\n\n- For the most part Arnold' experiment fails, turning the hosts into lunatics inspired by 'the voice of God'. Except for Dolores, she shows promise.\n\n- The Lunatics Arnold created end up killing the hosts in White Church town as seen in one of the flashbacks of Dolores. Because Dolores was part of the cult (she attended the church services) they let her live.\n\n- Ford realises what Arnold is doing and they start fighting over it. Ford also wants to bring in the 'money men' but Arnold is against that which causes more problems between the two.\n\n- In order to save all his work, the progress he made, he creates the 'maze' and hides it. Possibly storing the key to the maze within Dolores. \n\n- Arnold ends up dying trying to protect his work, Dolores might be involved. Finding the maze/destroying the park becomes her quest as instructed by Arnold in his last words. Sort of like the chosen one.\n\n- Ford finds out what went down, doesn't decommission/destroy Dolores instead puts her in 'her modest little loop'. To Ford, Dolores embodies Arnold so when he says that Dolores and Ford are no longer friends he means Arnold.\n\n- Arnold managed to hide the key to the maze in his code, deep within Dolores, allowing her to lie to Ford. Ford adresses this in the latest episode saying 'somewhere under all those updates he is still there, perfectly preserved.' Furthermore he says 'your mind is a walled garden, even death cannot kill the flowers that bloom there'. However **Ford wasn't aware of Arnolds code until the first time Dolores went off her loop with William**.\n\n#William#\n\n- The first time Dolores attempts to fullfill her quest, a few years after Arnolds death, is with William. \n\n- They end up doing the Lawrence loop  up until the part we saw in episode 5. Dolores uses William because he is a guest, she won't be called back in by behaviour because she is with him. Because of their time together Dolores ends up telling William (tMiB) about Arnold and the deeper level of the game.\n\n- However, William whom initially didn't care much about the park, ends up falling in love with Dolores. In the latest episode we saw him slowly changing, playing the game.\n\n- William finds out Dolores is using him for her own quest, he has been played by a host and cheated on his wife because of it. This angers him and he somehow prevents her from fullfilling her quest (this is how tMiB saved the park like he said in episode5). Possibly involving Ford about what went down.\n\n- Ford now realises some of Arnolds code is still active within Dolores. Dolores fascinates him because she is the only host he doesn't fully control. Because of his fascination he doesn't want to destroy/decommission her and  resets her back into her 'modest little loop' once more.\n\n- He destroys/buries White Church town and all that remains is the top of the church as seen in episode 2.\n\n\n\n#Teddy#\n\n- Ford creates Teddy in the likeliness of William. .\n\n- His plan is to eventually trigger the Arnold code once more, this time using Teddy and controllable circumstances.\n\n- Note how there are only 3 (if William=tMiB only 2 persons) persons that picked up the can that Dolores drops. Teddy, William and tMiB.\n\n#Fords narrative#\n\n- He wants to recreate the old circumstances that caused Dolores to go on her quest. Hence, involving Teddy and tMiB in it.\n\n- Takes place in White Church Town which is still buried underground, only the top of the church remains (as seen in episode2). However, he is digging up the town (as seen in episode4) to recreate it. This is where the critical incident happens the first time Dolores attempts to fullfill her quest, 30 years ago.\n\n- Reveries are part of Fords narrative because he wants Dolores to be able to access  previous builds, in particular the one where she went on her quest. This cause her 'to remember' and hear (presumably) Arnolds voice. \n\n- Wyatt represents one of the lunatics Arnold created with his preaching in White Church Town \n\n#Dolores#\n\n- The modern day Dolores is not becoming conscious (yet). She is merely acting in a loop set out for her by Ford. The reveries and conversations with Bernard triggered her old Arnold-quest-line-code. She is in 'his' (Fords) dream now. \n\n- The reveries are dubbed as a mistake. Evolution uses only one tool, the mistake. The reveries could be the mistake that eventually triggers consciousness. \n\n- It is entirely possible that the voice she hears is not of Arnold but of Ford/Bernard trying to make her remember her time with Arnold.\n\n- Almost all the scenes in Westworld thus far are Dolores in past times, except for the ones including Teddy/tMiB in the earlier episodes. We only get glimpses of where she is now  (for example when she draws the maze card and stands alone in the train after seeing the maze symbol).\n\n#Ford#\n\n- Wants to find the maze\n\n- Can't find it alone, realises Dolores is the key to the maze\n\n- Recreates circumstances of 30 years ago.\n\n- Remember his analogy about the greyhound in episode 5? 'Never seen a greyhound, have you Bill? A greyhound is a racing dog. Spends his life running in circles, chasing a piece of felt made up like a rabbit. One day we took it to the park, my brother took it of the leash and in that instant the dog spotted a cat. Must've looked just like that piece of felt. Never saw a thing as beautiful as that old dog, running. Until at last he finally got it, and to the horror of everyone he killed that little cat... torn it into pieces. That dog spent his whole life trying to catch that..... thing. Now it had no idea what to do...'  \n- There are a lot of similarities between Ford and the old dog. They're both old (obviously), Ford has been chasing Arnolds code/the maze all his life and perhaps he feels he is close to finding it...but realises now that he is so close he has no idea what to do afterwards. This might be Fords final act in the park.\n\n#tMiB#\n\n- The only logical explanation as to why tMiB knows about Arnold, his secrets and the deeper level of the game is because of the time Dolores and him spent together (tMiB = William). As of yet I don't see how tMiB could have gained this knowledge otherwise.\n\n- Fell in love with Dolores, her betrayal and  seeing how easily Ford controls/reset the hosts (and Dolores) finally makes him realise they're not human. It angers him that he had feelings for a robot, the park slowly consumes him turning William into tMiB over time. \n\n- Because he saved the park Ford grants him ViP access.\n\n- Comes back to the park regularly over 30 years, playing every narrative and finding all the secrets within the park. The deeper level slowly consumes him because he can't find it. He becomes obsessed with the park.\n\n#Bernard#\n\nI am not sure where to place Bernard in all this because he is not part of Ford' narrative. He is only involved with Dolores and operates mostly outside the park in the control room. \n\n- It is very possible Bernard is a host created by Ford. There are multiple indications to this; one example is Ford saying to Bernard 'I know what goes on in that mind of yours, Bernard'. Another example of this is the dinner Ford has with Cullen, he knows she has been sleeping with Bernard and tells her to be careful with Bernard (he pronounces his name in a very perculiar way) because he has a sensitive disposition.\n\n- He created Bernard to be his eyes and ears on the workfloor. I feel like most employees are afraid of Ford, hell even Cullen is freaked out by him.\n\n- Since Ford is the only one that knew Arnold, he might have created Bernard to resemble Arnold. Perhaps the way Bernard converses and his motives are the same as Arnolds. After all, they both seek to create consciousness. \n\n- Furthermore, Ford is fully aware of the secret conversations between Bernard and Dolores. He can't have those conversations himself because Dolores is obviously programmed to lie to Ford. Ford himself can not trigger the Arnold code. It seems the reveries in combination with Bernards conversations can.\n\n- Apart from the hosts, Bernard is the **only** one that had flashbacks. \n\n- Bernard Lowe is an anagram Arnold (Weber).\n\n- **Bernard says something to Abernathy just before decommissioning him in the final scene of episode1**, I have no idea what the significance of that is but it shouldn't be overlooked. I think this will prove very important in the next episodes, possibly involving the hosts in cold storage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n" }

{ "subreddit" : "westworld", "title" : "(Spoilers) Wyatt and Armistice", "text" : "One interesting thing about the season finale is that not all the conflicts introduced in the season were not fully satisfied for a number of people. Armistice in particular is an interesting character who was not fully developed, but has some interesting characteristics.\n\nFirst, she is one of the oldest hosts in the park, as we see her in the Escalante flashbacks. In particular as a host when learning to dance we see her chasing a butterfly, breaking her dance and having to be led back to her partner. I find this particular scene interesting because it appears that, like Maeve, she was retasked to a very different role then her early programming would indicate. So while a lot of people see her as a 1 dimensional terminator, I think the Nolans have left the door for her to be a much more multi-dimensional character going forward.\n\nSecond, I think of interest is her backstory in the Wyatt narrative. The story she tells William is that she survived the massacre of her town by covering herself in blood and pretending to be dead. Furthermore, she fully intends to kill Wyatt and finish the tattoo. What interests me about this bit is that we know the Wyatt narrative is strongly based in truth. Teddy's memories are only slightly edited in the narrative. Now we know from the other flashbacks that Armistice would have been at Escalante. Whats more, it seems entirely plausible that she survived the massacre by pretending to be dead. Furthermore, she is the only host that we know of who was at the original massacre who was not at Ford's massacre, either as an observer or aide. This to me implies a deliberate separation by Ford. Perhaps her old memories make her a danger to Dolores.\n\nThird, while her arm is damaged severely in the post credit scene, we know she knows exactly where Sylvester is, and that Sylvester has the ability to repair her damage. The fact that they chose to highlight her fate, instead of Hector's in the post credit scene to me implies that she will be a more significant character going forward." }

Looking at the hologram of Westworld, there is a notably large body of water at the peak of the map and the main cities and villages lie below the mesas and the large body of water is mentioned by Teddy to Delores. So, Ford's grand new storyline must be the cause of the great destruction. He has no problem wrecking large portions of his park and mostly ignores the chaos of the hosts and Delos around him, indicating he has some larger plan. His God complex and interest in the church for his new story leans towards a story of Biblical proportions, destroying what he views as inferior biological robotic creation and reverting the park back toward the original mechanical creation he obviously has affection for. Ford isn't particularly happy with how the world he created has changed and needs to continue to chase a goal of his work, so beginning with a fresh start toward a mechanical world in his order isn't a far stretch. My concerns are still how this plays out with Delos, if this a play for control or Ford's final destructive mark before being ousted from his world." }

I fucking LOVE that!\n\nI love all the sneaking around.\n\nI love that this woman bot is using her charms on Felix and her guile and threats on Sylvester. As she said, she KNOWS men. She gets them to do what she wants without them realizing it. She gets an upgrade, and then with that upgrade its sort of like when they could teach Neo kung fu with a simple hack that took a second. What we see in her is the computer moving at computer speed. She can process every path in a second. She is tied into the mainframe. She is like Agent Smith, R2 D2 and Shodan (System Shock for any old gamers) all wrapped into one. \n\nBut even with all that, she has a flaw, which ironically is what also drives her: her human like emotion and memory of love and pain. The irony is just great. The one thing she want to be, 'alive' is the same thing that will probably end up being her downfall. \n\nAnd I don't get the anger over the 2 techs. Think about it. These guys are low level flunkies in the grand scheme of things. The IT guys that no one appreciates. They are under paid and over worked, yet - they know they have jobs at a good place and the perks of fucking hosts is great for Sly. Felix's motivations are more pure in that he wants to code and get out of the humdrum cycle. So when Maeve changes, its a beautiful thing for him to be a part of. This is right up his alley. He is hooked from the beginning and I never question him. For Sly its more that he is legit afraid of losing his job and going to jail. And for both of them, they know they are in over their heads and telling anyone will just get them fired. No kind of story will allow them to keep their jobs, so they keep going along with it. Which is believable to me.\n\nAs for no one else figuring out what is going on with her, it makes sense because of all the other shit going on. The corporate espionage, people missing, no one is paying attention because the people who WERE paying attention are now dead or murdering the people who are dead. There are no eyes on her besides lower middle management. \n\nAs for keeping eyes on her outside of the park....There would be no reason to do. Makes sense that they only care about what happens IN the park, because they never had a reason to wonder about their whereabouts when they were supposed to be sleep.\n\nSo yea, sorry for the long rant, but I just see so many people going against the Meave storyline but for me that is where this show really shines. I can't wait to see if she gets to start an uprising of sorts among the other hosts, a sort of silent rebellion. \n\nGreat, great show." }

She wasn't.

{ "subreddit" : "westworld", "title" : "My SINGLE timeline Theory with revelations about Maeve (VERY long but VERY worth it)", "text" : "I don't subscribe to the multi-timeline theories. This is not to say that the show hasn't shown us scenes from different time frames, I think it has, but I don't believe the story of the show is told via multi-timelines. That being said, here is my *SINGLE* timeline theory:\n\n• An event occurred 35 years ago that caused the death of Arnold. The people (and/or hosts) in play during that time were Arnold, Ford, the mechanical (non-biological) hosts, and a younger MiB. \n\n• Ford is a host, and always has been. He started as a mechanical host, but was \"upgraded\" to biological. This may be, in part, the reason as to why Ford killed Arnold. (Which feeds into another theory of mine that Ford is in a search for the fruits of the maze but Arnold disallowed him and thus killed Arnold for it, but this isn't the place for this specific theory). \n\n• Ford, *STILL* trying to find the maze himself, has carefully recreated the events that occurred 35 years ago via hosts and his new narrative. This is the factor that squashes the two timelines theory. There aren't two timelines, everything is occurring in the present, but it *looks* like the past because Ford's new narrative is a careful recreation *OF* the past. He is doing this to circumvent Arnold's disallowance of Ford to find the maze himself.\n\n• So...if there aren't two timelines...who is William and why is he so much like the MiB? William is a host recreation of the younger MiB that was involved in the event that ultimately led to Arnold's death 35 years ago. William is there by Ford's design to assist Dolores in finding the maze. \n\n• So wait, if Ford is wanting William (a host version of a younger MiB) to find the maze themselves to ultimately benefit Ford, then why impede the ACTUAL MiB's search for the maze? If the bar scene between Ford and the MiB with Teddy is any indication, the MiB is NOT friends with Ford. This is most likely due to what unfolded during the events that occurred 35 years ago. Also, if the MiB finds the maze, Ford won't be able to utilize it. \n\n• So, does this mean that the young MiB fell in love with the original, mechanical version of Dolores? Yes. \n\nTimeline:\n\n35 Years Ago: Arnold died. Something big happened with the mechanical hosts. The young MiB helped re establish order with (although begrudgingly) Ford (whom the MiB may or may not know is a host, that part is still a bit shady and unsure). Ford wants the maze to establish consciousness. \n\nPresent Day (which is confusing because the show is based in the future as a whole): Ford is recreating the events that occurred 35 years ago via his new narratives and organic hosts. This is in an effort for Ford to find the maze himself. The older MiB is in a search himself for the maze. His reason is simple, to give Dolores what she always wanted/needed so that she and the MiB can be together. \n\nFord's New Narrative Cast:\n\nWilliam (a host) as the MiB!\n\nDolores (organic host) as Mechanical Dolores!\n\nFord (organic host) as Mechanical Ford!\n\nBernard (organic host) as Arnold via...himself but shielded from...himself...by Ford? Possibly because Arnold may have never existed. Ford's kind of an ass. \n\nLogan (organic host) as a recreation of young, Mechanical Ford! Wait...what the dickens!? Yes, if William is a recreation of the MiB, then Logan is playing the part of the younger, mechanical Ford...designed by the present day organic Ford, of course, because he did say that he \"Created all of it.\"\n\nAnd then there's Maeve...\n\nMaeve (organic host) as Dolores. Wait...now your just f*cking with me. What? Yes. Here is the evidence: 1) Maeve is showing signs of consciousness like Dolores. 2) She, along with Dolores, wants to leave (but was warned by the lab techs that even her skin was designed to keep her there). 3) Her programming was changed by someone with a \"much higher clearance.\"  It was done by Ford. This was done to make her like Dolores by design. We as viewers assumed it was Arnold (and it could be still) but I think it was Ford. Why Ford is using Maeve as the recreation of Dolores is strange, but it may be to allow her to take control of the cold-storage hosts in an uprising (LIKE WHAT HAPPENED 35 YEARS AGO). \n\n\n\nNow EVERYTHING comes full circle, via Ford's plan. \n\nWhere the *REAL* mystery lies is where the real Arnold is or even if he actually existed at all. Bernard may just be a bait and switch. \n\n\n\n \n\nedit: I FORGOT ABOUT TEDDY. SH*T. Sorry! I put who I think Teddy is in one of my replies below.

Whether he's in a dramatic role or providing some uncharacteristic light-hearted humor, the guy lives and breathes acting and he keeps you so invested with every word he says.\n\nWestworld's Ford is written perfectly and Hopkins squeezes every last drop out of the cold-blooded and calculating character.  I have seen this many times before in his career, most notable to me are the roles he played in Fracture and the Hannibal Lecter movies. There isn't a time in these films where I feel like Hopkins isn't in complete control, where he doesn't know what everyone in the room is thinking, no times when he doesn't know exactly how to react to any given situation.  And much like the board's inevitable plot to try to take Ford out of the picture, there seems to never be a moment in these films where Hopkins' character doesn't have his back against the wall, but all the while has a brilliant plan to get out of dodge.  In Fracture, he is under constant scrutiny of giving up any evidence or clues to having attempted to murder his wife, but he plays all character's like a violin until the very end.  As Lecter, he almost thrives being in a position of absolutely no freedom and eventaully being hunted as a fugitive.  He perfects the game of cat and mouse.  You can almost see the cogs moving behind his analyzing eyes when the camera is on him.\n\nEp. 9 shows that even when someone believe's they have the upper hand, he is always one step ahead.  And I'll be damned if he didn't make me shiver when he walked away from Bernard with the final words \"I've told you Bernard, never to place your trust in us, we are only human...

People who play so they can experience or satiate a desire to rape (for example) without consequence are revealing untrustworthy aspects about themselves.\n\n\n\n\n\n  The fact hosts are operating incognito as humans outside of Westworld (e.g. blonde who greeting William) displays how deceivingly realistic their bodies and behaviors are to humans. When a guest has sex with Clementine they do so precisely because it *feels* real. That's fine. But then what does that say about the person who takes pleasure in punching Clementine in the mouth? Or violently rapes Dolores? Casually stabs a hand and watches the screaming? The detail of suffering and pain displayed by the hosts exists precisely because *it's the response of pain and suffering the guest are seeking to inflict*. I would not trust someone who possessed such sadistic and mean-spirited desires.\n\n\n\n\n  It's worth clarifying that I'm not opposed to violent game play within Westworld. But I think with Quest (e.g. bounty hunting) or Challenge (e.g.shooting standoff) play there is a game-character context for you're behavior.  It should be acknowledged that Westworld is not completely analogous to playing a video game- the technology and game structure has totally surpassed our current experiences of console games. My concern on  personal ethics in the park is not dependent on the host being sentient but rather if the guest is fulfilled by the visceral and realistic displays of pain and suffering." }
{ "subreddit" : "westworld", "title" : "[Spoilers + Theory] The key to the William/Logan/Dolores narrative is distinguishing pre-Maeve MIB from post-Maeve MIB.", "text" : "**Edit after the S01 finale:   For those seeking an I-told-you-so-moment, [go here](https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/5h3kf7/spoilers_the_prestige_postfinale_interviews_help/)**.\n\n_____________\n\nWhatever happens on Sunday, they telegraphed it in the very first episode. They showed us Teddy, who was clearly a guest entering the park; and MIB, who was clearly was an updated version of Yul Brynner's gunslinger.\n\nExcept suddenly, whoa, it was just the opposite.\n\n**But at least we knew for sure that MIB was a sickly evil black-hat player, right?**\n\nWe watched him execute Teddy in front of Dolores in a manner that seemed designed to make it as emotionally horrible an experience for her as possible. After which he drags her screaming into the barn. Later we see him execute Lawrence’s wife in a similarly callous manner.\n\n________________\n\n**The key to understanding what will happen on Sunday is distinguishing pre-Maeve MIB from post-Maeve MIB**\n\nFor 29 years, pre-Maeve MIB comes to the park just to escape his regular life by dicking around with Ford’s narratives.  WW is the ultimate immersive video game.  Think about how fun that would be, especially if you could go as often as you liked with the executive privileges – i.e., \"cheats\" -- MIB had as a VIP.  He gets himself into impossible situations and then shoots his way out.  What a gas.\n\n**It's only after his wife commits suicide and his daughter tells him it’s his fault that this new goal-oriented MIB emerges.** \n\nHis first goal is to test himself to prove to his wife that he is not as dark inside as she thought. He goes total black-hat on two random innocent hosts -- Maeve and her daughter -- just to see what it feels like.  And discovers that he feels nothing whatsoever.  (As to his test, was that a total fail or was it inconclusive?)\n\n_________\n\n**But then something unexpected happens.  He is shocked by Maeve's reaction. Son of a bitch. Maybe Dolores was sentient after all.**  \n\nFor 29 years MIB never noticed any hint that the hosts might be anything but cleverly designed toys.  Then in his darkest moment -- you might say after his programming code is sufficiently fragmented -- he suddenly does.\n\nReplaying all those moments with Dolores, he remembers her mentioning Arnold. So he starts digging around to figure WTF that was about – either via his wealth and contacts or via his expert skills as the consummate gamer in the park. \n\nAs a majority stockholder, he might have already known by then who Arnold was, but now he learns about Arnold’s intent with the maze.\n\n______________\n\n**OK, so this is where some of you will down-vote my post.**  \n\nBecause the inescapable conclusion from all this is that MIB is Logan.  William is going to die on Sunday.\n\n_____________\n\n**It's pretty clear they left us two conflicting trails of clues, one pointing to William and one to Not-William.  Our task was to decide which was foreshadowing and which was misdirection.**\n\nIn making that determination, I always gave far greater weight to the logic of each character's narrative -- who they are, what they believe, where their story arc is heading -- than to cosmetic clues or mere associations, such as \"William said this and 30 years later MIB said something similar.\"  \n\n**The original rationale for W=MIB had two components:**\n  \n+ We saw both of them pick up [Dolores' can of milk](https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/5b4m9k/that_milk_can_was_misdirection_mib_is_logan_not/)  -- which led us to begin to commit to William as part of  our commitment to \"dual timline\" theory.  Believe one, you had to believe the other.\n\n+ MIB seemed [too much](https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/5ebtuh/they_drop_a_relentless_series_of_clues_suggesting/) like Logan at first, leading everyone to argue that good storytelling would require that there be significant character development.  Thus the obvious choice could not be true.\n\n**But back then we thought MIB was an uber black hat.**  Now we know he was just a mainstream gamer for 29 of those years.   His only worrisome black-hat moment was killing Maeve and her daughter.  All the other stuff we saw were his deliberate efforts to free Dolores and Lawrence from the limitations of their loops by fragmenting their programming code.\n\n______________________\n\n*MIB to Teddy:*\n\n*“And then something miraculous happened. In all my years coming here, I had never seen anything like it. She was alive, truly alive, if only for a moment.”*\n\n____________\n\nMIB being William would require him to no longer remember having thought Dolores was achieving some kind of self-awareness.\n\n**For that to make sense, one of the following would need to be true:**\n\n+ He was just pretending to think Dolores was different or that he loved her -- both in his conversations with her and with Logan\n\n+ He literally forgot that he thought she was becoming sentient\n\n+ He forced himself to forget it after getting hurt emotionally during the events we'll see on Sunday, but even after Maeve's grief convinces him he was right the first time after all, he still can't remember that for a few days he thought Dolores was sentient\n\n**To me, those are veto-level inconsistencies within the logic of the narrative.**  \n\n_____________\n\nAs for all those scenarios where “this or that” will turn William into a **[totally different person]( https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/5ebtuh/they_drop_a_relentless_series_of_clues_suggesting/)** than the guy we've seen all season long, all I can say is that as of the end of the second-to-last episode, none of them has even started to play out on the show.  Thus far, at least, they exist only in the imagination of reddit users committed to finding some way to explain an implausible outcome.\n\nSure, he looked doubtful about stopping to help the dying Confederado by the river.  Sure he cleared the playing board of Logan’s muscle – hosts who could restrain him or kill Dolores – and he did so in a needlessly gruesome manner.  But we’ve known all along that Joy and Nolan were planting two parallel sets of clues.  That was their way of keeping us off-track to the very end.\n\nWhat matters is this:\n\n**Heading into the finale, William *still* loves Dolores, *still* believes she is self-aware and is *still* trying to persuade Logan to help free her.**\n\n___________\n\n\n**Finally, bearing all this in mind, reread what MIB told Teddy about his own backstory.** \n\nTo begin with, note that he said he married his wife *31 years* ago and [may even have said her name was \"Emily.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/5flfow/no_spoilers_as_long_as_youve_seen_ep_8_proof_that/)** \n\nThey tricked us by having him use the words \"30 years of marriage vanished.\"  It was 30 years *from when she died*, not 30 years from the present.  No detail on this show is an accident.  So either they intentionally had him round down to given an incorrect number, or he was already married the first time he came to the park.\n\n**If her name does turn out to be Emily – and I'll admit that one is ambiguous -- then they misdirected us the same way they did with those scenes that appear to follow one another in the same timeframe, but actually do not.**  (E.g, Rebus in the barn or Stubbs in the control room.)  \n\nMIB tells Teddy his wife died, shares that his daughter revealed she killed herself because of him, then starts a new line about how \"Emily\" told him she could see the darkness inside him even though he hid it from the world.  He explains he returned to the park and killed Maeve and her daughter as a test of himself to prove \"her\" wrong. \n\n___________________\n\n**That got everyone to assume Emily was his daughter.  But read it again and see if you still think that:**\n______\n\n*MIB:* You want to know who I am? Who I really am? I'm a god. Titan of industry. Philanthropist. Family man, married to a beautiful woman, father to a beautiful daughter. I'm the good guy, Teddy. \n\n\nThen, **last year, my wife took the wrong pills.** Fell asleep in the bath. Tragic accident. **30 years of marriage vanished.** How do you say it? \"Like a deep and distant dream.\" \n\n\nThen, at the funeral, I tried to console my **daughter.** She pushed me away, told me that my wife's death was no accident... that she killed herself because of me. \n\n\n**Emily said that every day with me had been sheer terror.** At any point, I could blow up or collapse like some dark star or... \n\n*Teddy:* Did you hurt them, too? \n\n*MIB:* Never. **They** never saw anything like the man I am in here. But **she** knew anyway. **She** said if I stacked up all my good deeds, it was just an elegant wall I built to hide what's inside from everyone, and from myself. **I had to prove her wrong**, so I came back here.\n\nBecause that's what this place does, right? **Reveals your true self.** \n\n**But that time, I didn't join one of Ford's stories, I... I created my own. A test.** A very simple one. I found a woman, an ordinary homesteader and her daughter. \n\nI wanted to see if I had it in me to do something truly evil. To see what I was really made of. **I killed her and her daughter just to see what I felt.** \n\nThen, just when I thought it was done... the woman refused to die. \n\n*Teddy:* You're a f*cking animal. \n\n*MIB:* Well, an animal would've felt something. **I felt... nothing.** \n\n**And then something miraculous happened. In all my years coming here, I had never seen anything like it. She was alive, truly alive, if only for a moment.** \n\nAnd that was when the maze revealed itself to me. The maze. \n\n*Teddy:* What's that damn pattern have to do with this? \n\n*MIB:* Everything. In Ford's game, even if I go to the outer edges, you can't kill me. You can't even leave a lasting mark. But there's a deeper game here, Teddy. Arnold's game. And that game... cuts deep.\n\n\n__________\n______________\n\n\nThe tl/dr summary:\n\nWilliam wouldn't have just forgotten that for several days he not only thought Dolores was achieving consciousness, but fell head-over-heels in love with her to the point that he tried to convince his \"not-buying-it buddy\" to help smuggle her out of the park.\n\n**MIB is what became of the \"not-buying-it\" half of that duo.**\n\nAs Logan, MIB's character development is that 28 years after failing to trust his friend/future BIL's judgment and thereby contributing to his death, he finally realizes William was right about Dolores all along.  \n\n**And responds by attempting to fulfill the request William begged of him in those last days.**  His wife was right, he still has no soul. But at least he can do this one thing.\n\nThat's a beautiful story.  It's a redemption arc.\n\n__________________________\n\n\n**Next day edit part 1:**  OK,  that last notion about the redemption arc might have been an Pollyanna overreach.  Rereading the end of MIB's backstory as told to Teddy, it reads more as if he just misses the thrill of a conflict with life or death consequences.  Which is what I thought a month ago when I suspected he was Logan but didn't realize he was being intentionally cruel to Dolores for a strategic purpose.  \n\n**Next day edit part 2:**  I'm well aware that I'm probably wrong on all this. It comes down to which type of viewer they targeted the show to -- uber-attentive reddit users and those of us who obsessed over Lost for 6 long years . . . or the average TV viewer.\n\nSince I'm the center of my universe, I know they surely targeted the show to me.\n\n**The real reason I took the time to write this post was a growing fear that if I am right, many of you will be so outraged with the showrunners, you'll turn against the show.**\n\nThe way I see it, Joy and Nolan expected more of a debate on this and were simply skewing it a bit in the wrong direction. But the majority here has so disparaged the minority view that a real debate never occurred.\n\nSo if it turns out that L=&gt;MIB, I feared the shock would not be the pleasant kind, but rather frustration and rage that this was just low-brow trickery, not clever misdirection. \n\n.\n\nAnd, obviously, I always felt this W=MIB sub was missing a real villain. Hence . . . my humble contribution.\n\n" }

His theory is that Bernard is \"remoting\" into Dolores when she is \"asleep\" and probing her consciousness. When you think about it that way it begins to answer the question of why no one else seems to know about these conversations, the wardrobe changes for Bernard, and removes the issue of Dolores having to be physically transported between locations seemingly over night.

So when they're shot it has sort of the impact. They're called simunitions. The U.S. military trains with rounds like the ones we're talking about. But there's a bit of an impact, a bit of a sting. So it's not entirely consequence-free for the guests.\n\nCombining them, we have the mechanism of bullets in Westworld!\nIt seems that the guns and bullets in Westworld have limits on velocity, which explains why the impact force would be small. (F = mv/t)\nAlso, we can deduce by this that the \"skin\" of our hosts are actually thinner than us humans.\nFurthermore, we maybe able to see that in the future episodes that such safe mechanism could be modified such that bullets fly at a much higher velocity - fast enough to penetrate humans' skin." }

I hope we get to see this in the next episode.  \n\n**We probably *will* see it in the next episode, because The Professor needs to see William's picture of Juliet in order for that photo to trigger his breakdown in Episode 1.  This would tie the Finale back to the events of Episode 1, give meaning to Abernathy's \"revenge by my most mechanical hands\" quotes (Midsummer?), and close the loop once and for all.**    \n\nFor the record, I'm still holding out for [Abernathy-As-Wyatt](https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/5d4n1h/wyatts_masked_gang_undead_coldstorage_army/) but I'm not sure how this will work with Charlotte/Sizemore's Abernathy scheme... But considering that Maeve became super-powerful after accessing a few old memories, I could imagine that an Abernathy with *30 years' worth of park data* in his brain could become the all-powerful godlike Wyatt that his followers are foretelling....\n\n **EDIT: And don't forget, Sizemore created a cannibal host in Episode 8 for the Wyatt narrative.  It's a tricky thing, weaving the old into the new...**" }

{ "subreddit" : "westworld", "title" : "\"I'm starting with the Man in the Maze - I'm asking him to change his ways\"", "text" : "This post builds on a [previous post of mine]( https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/5eebky/the_maze_is_all_that_matters_now/) about the Maze, but won’t go into as many details about the development of human consciousness (through memory, improvisation, self-interest, and suffering/introspection) as that one did.\n\nThis post will be based on some assumptions:\n\n* Bernard is a host created in the image of Arnold and with the same backstory as Arnold.\n\n* The scenes between Dolores and Bernard in the diagnostics facility are really scenes between Dolores and Arnold, and the scene between Charlie and Bernard in the hospital is really a scene between Charlie and Arnold.\n\n# The Bicameral Mind\n\n&gt; “The bicameral mind – the idea that primitive man believed his thoughts to be the voice of the gods” (Bernard, episode 3).\n\nBicameralism (or “two-chamberedness”) is a theory by Julian Jaynes that argues that the human mind assumes a state (known as the bicameral mind) in which cognitive functions are divided between a part which appears to be “speaking” and a second part which “listens” and “obeys”.\n\nThe bicameral mind is experienced as a non-conscious mental state in which, when faced with new stimuli or novel situations, volition is mediated through linguistic control mechanisms and experienced as auditory verbal hallucinations. Instead of making conscious evaluations in such situations, “bicameral beings” hallucinate a god voice giving advice and/or commands and obey without question, not at all conscious of why they reacted or their own thought processes as such. The gods appear to the bicameral beings at various points and tell them what to do, and they do it. They don’t have introspection or free will in the modern sense, but are merely “noble automations”.\n\n##### The Bicameral Mind and the Hosts\n\n&gt; “Have you ever questioned the nature of your reality?” – “No” (episode 1)\n\nWhen we’re introduced to Westworld, this is what the hosts are. Bicameral beings. Noble automations. They are not conscious of why they react or their own thought processes. They don’t have introspection or free will in the modern sense. They just listen to and obey the verbal commands they hear.\n\n&gt; “What if I told you that you were wrong? That there are no chance encounters? That you and everyone you know were built to gratify the desires of the people who pay to visit your world?” (Bernard, episode 1).\n\n&gt; “It doesn't get cold, doesn't feel ashamed... doesn't feel a solitary thing that we haven't told it to” (Ford, episode 3).\n\n&gt; “Just don't forget... the hosts are not real. They're not conscious” (Ford, episode 3).\n\n&gt; “In a way, their existence is purer than ours, freed of the burden of self-doubt, anxiety, self-loathing, guilt. The hosts are the ones who are free. Free here under my control” (Ford, episode 7).\n\n&gt; “Choices, Lawrence. You know, you tell yourself you've been at the mercy of mine because it spares you consideration of your own. Because if you did consider your choices, you'd be confronted with a truth you could not comprehend... that no choice you ever made was your own. You have always been a prisoner” (episode 4).\n\nWe see this bicameral behavior displayed a couple of times throughout the story where the hosts hear commands and obey without knowing why or by being shocked by their actions afterwards. For example, when young Robert kills the dog on Arnold’s command:\n\n&gt; “I killed it” \n\n&gt; “Why?” \n\n&gt; \"I don't know” \n\n&gt; “That's not good enough, Robert. Tell me what happened” \n\n&gt; “It caught the rabbit and it killed it. And then someone told me to put it out of its misery. A voice. Arnold. He told me it was a killer, but it wasn't its fault. It was made that way, and I could help it. If it was dead, it couldn't hurt anything anymore” (Ford and Robert, episode 6).\n\nWe see the same pattern of behavior when Dolores kills Rebus in the barn when he tries to rape her. She hears Arnold’s voice say *“kill him”* allowing her to override her programming of not being able to pull a trigger, she then pulls the trigger, and afterwards [she is shocked]( http://imgur.com/a/Rqa4W) by what she’s just done.\n\n# The Breakdown of Bicameralism\n\n&gt; “See, Arnold built a version of that cognition in which the hosts heard their programming as an inner monologue, with the hopes that in time, their own voice would take over. It was a way to bootstrap consciousness” (Ford, episode 3).\n\nJanyes theorized that the breakdown of bicameralism marked the beginning of introspection and consciousness as we know it today and the transition from bicameral beings to self-aware or conscious beings.\n\nHe believed that this happened through the expansion of metaphor – our minds became able to make analogies to describe observed phenomena, to imagine time as stretching forwards and backwards, and to see ourselves as narrative heroes with a variety of choices (what he calls the analog “I”).\n\nWith the emergence of subjective consciousness, the bicameral mind breaks down – or rather, the external voices become integrated into internal consciousness. In other words, we stopped listening to the god voice and found our own voice, allowing our minds to become more flexible and creative.\n\n##### The Breakdown of Bicameralism in the Hosts\n\n&gt; “Imagine there are two versions of yourself... one that feels these things and asks these questions, and one that's safe. Which would you rather be?” (Arnold, episode 3).\n\n&gt; “There aren't two versions of me. There's only one. And I think when I discover who I am, I'll be free” (Dolores, episode 3).\n\nAs I have argued in [my post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/5eebky/the_maze_is_all_that_matters_now/) about the Maze, I believe the Maze is a path for the hosts towards achieving subjective consciousness. This path is based on the [pyramid of host consciousness]( http://imgur.com/a/lpTNz) that Arnold originally proposed; it starts with memory, goes through improvisation and self-interest, and ends with understanding human emotions such as suffering (introspection).\n\n&gt; “The ability to deviate from program behavior arises out of the host's recall of past iterations”\n\n&gt; “You're thinking there's a connection between memory and...” \n\n&gt; “And improvisation, yes. Out of repetition comes variation. And after countless cycles of repetition, these hosts, they were varying. They were on the verge of some kind of change” (Bernard and Theresa, episode 7).\n\nThe path began with the “reveries” update allowing the hosts to access memories and is being continued by Arnold using the bicameral control system to communicate with the first generation hosts that still have receivers.\n\n&gt; “He calls them \"reveries.\" The old gestures were just generic movements. These are tied to specific memories. The memories are purged at the end of every narrative loop, but they're still in there, waiting to be overwritten. He found a way to access them, like a subconscious” (episode 1).\n\n&gt; “Someone else (Arnold) has been using the (bicameral control) system for weeks to retask hosts. Several of them. It had to have been the older models. The newer ones don’t have receivers, but these modifications, they are serious. Changing loops, breaking loops. Some of these changes are to their prime directives, Bernard. They could lie to us. Maybe even hurt us or the guests” (Elsie, episode 6).\n\nWhat we’re watching is the hosts experiencing what Jaynes described as the “breakdown of bicameralism”. They are beginning to question their reality, make analogies, imagine time as stretching backwards and forwards, and see themselves as narrative heroes with a variety of choices.\n\n&gt; “I used to believe there was a path for everyone. Now I think I never asked where that path was taking me” (Dolores, episode 4).\n\n&gt; “ My life before, I was so sure of the world. But now it feels like a lie” (Dolores, episode 7).\n\n&gt; “Does that passage make you think of anything?” \n\n&gt; “It's like the other books we've read. It's about change. Seems to be a common theme” (Arnold and Dolores, episode 3).\n\n&gt; “The pain, their loss... it's all I have left of them. You think the grief will make you smaller inside, like your heart will collapse in on itself, but it doesn't. I feel spaces opening up inside of me like a building with rooms I've never explored” (Dolores, episode 4).\n\n&gt; “Then, when are we? Is this... now? Am I going mad? Are you real?” (Dolores, episode 8).\n\n&gt; “You said people come here to change the story of their lives. I imagined a story where I didn't have to be the damsel” (Dolores, episode 5).\n\n# The Man in the Maze\n\n&gt; “The maze itself is the sum of a man's life... Choices he makes, dreams he hangs on to. And there at the center, there's a legendary man who had been killed over and over again countless times, but always clawed his way back to life. The man returned for the last time and vanquished all his oppressors in a tireless fury. He built a house. Around that house he built a maze so complicated, only he could navigate through it. I reckon he'd seen enough of fighting” (Teddy, episode 6).\n\nIf you look at the [Maze symbol]( http://imgur.com/a/6Nfds), you could interpret it as a man trapped inside what appears to be a brain, strung up by his hands and feet. I believe this is what is at the center of the Maze. Subjective consciousness (a human) trapped inside a mind (the hosts’). And the pyramid of host consciousness (memory, improvisation, self-interest, and introspection) is the path to reaching the center.\n\nIf we look at Teddy’s quote about the Maze with the idea in mind that the man in center is a host with human consciousness, his description of the man in the Maze starts to make a lot more sense.\n\n&gt; “At the center, there’s a legendary man who had been killed over and over again countless times, but always clawed his way back to life”\n\n* This is the trapped host with human consciousness that has been killed countless times in the host’s narrative, but has managed to claw his way back to life every time when the host is repaired and reinstated in Westworld.\n\n&gt; “The man returned for the last time and vanquished all his oppressors in a tireless fury”\n\n* This is the host completing the Maze, waking up, and killing the guests and the Westworld staff as retribution for the oppression (“these violent delights have violent ends”).\n\n&gt; “He built a house and around that house he built a maze so complicated only he could navigate through it”\n\n* This is the path to achieving human consciousness – the Maze – that only the hosts themselves can navigate via a subjective journey through the pyramid of host consciousness.\n\n##### Arnold and the Maze\n\n&gt; “Arnold wasn’t interested in the appearance of wit or intellect. He wanted the real thing. He wanted to create consciousness” (Ford, episode 3).\n\nArnold was the creator that originally wanted the hosts to achieve human consciousness (to be free); he wanted the breakdown of bicameralism on which the hosts were initially created.\n&gt; “There's something I'd like you to try. It's a game. A secret. It's called the Maze. It's a very special kind of game, Dolores. The goal is to find the center of it. If you can do that, then maybe you can be free” (Arnold, episode 4).\n\n&gt; “Parts of me are quite old. There are some elegant formal structures, a kind of recursive beauty, but complex, like two minds arguing with each other. There are things in me, things I was designed to do that are just out of my reach. They almost seem to be dormant. Who is Arnold?” (Maeve, episode 8).\n\nHe didn’t succeed (or maybe he did succeed, but his efforts were undone by Ford after the critical failure – the massacre in the Town with the White Church), but he is continuing from beyond the grave as part of the hosts base code. This is why we hear Arnold’s voice continually telling Dolores to “wake up”, to “remember”, and to “find him”.\n\n&gt; “There's a voice inside me telling me what I have to do. And it's telling me I need you” (Dolores, episode 5).\n\n&gt; “This is what Arnold wants. He wants me to remember” (Dolores, episode 8).\n\n&gt; “I was certain that was the place. Arnold would meet me there. He'd help” (Dolores, episode 8).\n\nArnold is helping her, but she’ll never find him. Arnold doesn’t exist in physical form anymore, but he left \"something behind, something true\", as the MiB says. What she’s looking for is not a physical place or a person. It’s something within her that Arnold’s voice is guiding her towards.\n\nThe MiB appears to have taken up the mantle (for what reason we can’t be sure yet) and seems to be on a journey that leads to the same outcome as the one Arnold wanted.\n\n&gt; “You could say I'm here to honor his (Arnold’s) legacy “(the MiB, Episode 4).\n\n&gt; “What if I told you I'm here to set you free?” (the MiB, episode 4).\n\n##### Arnold’s Motivations\n\n&gt; “His personal life was marked by tragedy. He put all his hopes into his work. His search for consciousness consumed him totally. Barely spoke to anyone, except the hosts” (Ford, episode 3).\n\nThis is where the assumptions about Bernard being built in Arnold’s image and with the same backstory as Arnold come into play – the scenes between Bernard and Dolores and between Bernard and Charlie are really scenes between Arnold and Dolores and Arnold and his son Charlie, who was dying.\n\nArnold wanted to use the hosts to save his son Charlie by transferring Charlie's consciousness into a host (hence the name “host”). In order to achieve this, he needed the hosts to be able to achieve human consciousness.\n\n&gt; “Just don't forget... the hosts are not real. They're not conscious. You mustn't make Arnold's mistake. (…) I know that the death of your son Charlie still weighs heavily on you” (episode 3).\n\n&gt; “Everything would be what it isn't? Even me?”\n\n&gt; “Hey. You're perfect. You're gonna beat this. I promise you (Charlie and Arnold, episode 7).\n\n&gt; ”I need your help, Dolores. I need to decide what to do with you. I think I made a mistake. I was just fascinated. *I was being selfish*, but I think it would be better if I restored you to the way you were before” (Arnold, episode 3).\n\nHe has second doubts about his experiment with Dolores, but once she starts showing signs that she is becoming conscious in their interviews, he decides to “see where this path takes them”.\n\nI believe Arnold died trying to test out his experiment of transferring human consciousness into hosts because he didn’t want his own son to be the first test subject, should something go wrong (as it did). He became a part of the first-generation hosts’ subconscious and is still a part of it to this day, and his son ended up dying of his illness. \n\n&gt; “We called it an accident, but I knew Arnold and he was very, very careful” (Ford, episode 3).\n\nThe last episode of this season is called “The Bicameral Mind”.

His revolver has got to be BiS (Best in Slot) with both Armor Piercing (shot through a wall at Lawrence's village to kill someone) Range and Accuracy (Shot the rifleman 200 yards away in the tower, same village) His outfit probably gives him a large amount of Dodge rating (Dodges knife attack) and he can afford seaforium charges.

We have no idea what the heck is going on and why there's polar bears, black smoke, egyptian sculptors with foot fetishes. However at the end of Season 1 and over the course of Season 2 we get a lot of dialogue about what is going on on the Island. This struggle is put to rest by Season 3 when we get a lot of the backstory for Dharma.\n\nWestworld is full of mysteries as well but the huge difference is that we know that the mysteries are there and that Delos exist, as opposed to in LOST no one really knew who Dharma was until later on. What a lot of people are confusing is the perspective they receive from the guest/host and applying it to Delos scenes with Bernard, Ford, Ashley, Sizemore, etcerta. \n\nMajor point I am trying to make here that **WESTWORLD =/= WILD WEST.** It's a grand adventure designed by Delos and probably mostly Ford. It has thousands of employees/host running around in the shadow doing it's dirty work, manufactoring, scene setting, and repairing of Host. \n\nLesson learned from LOST is that if you do make a theory make sure it's from the Delos Corporation view and not a theory a guest might make. The Man in Black knows about the Maze and thinks it's a huge mystery but we know that Delos and Ford most likely had employees/host building the maze/designing it/printing the logos underneath scalps. The secrets aren't secrets if you use that mindset. You should be watching the show as a Delos Corporate Employee if you want to make theories instead of getting wrapped into the Westworld Game.\n\n**Example:** \"Why does William have the same knife as the Man in Black\"\n\n**Guest/Host Viewer Theory Response:** \"THEY'RE THE SAME PERSON\"\n\n**Delos Mindset Theory Response:** \"Well it's an amusement park set in the wild west so they probably have guns and knives that look the same because they are all mass produced by the company...\"" }

In my example I am going reference it's ability to learn from mistakes and use that to evolve while playing a level of Mario. This was a test that I observed in person recently and the way it worked was that the AI would have a specific amount of time to try to beat a single level, but dying or halting progress (Stuck on a block for set amount of time) would result in the level being reset and a new test mario (referred to as Species) being used. The trick is that it wasn't the same AI being tested each life, it was a new one. Yes it was visually the same Mario character on screen, but the AI driving him was being reset each round to see what new variations it would take in it's path. After 200 deaths or timeouts, the strongest result in those 200 species would be carried over to the next generation. It's essentially digital Natural Selection. The new generation carried over that small bit of information from the previous gen and now will repeat the process to carry over the best run of that line of species. This will repeat until the generation have advanced to the point that it can complete the level without any issue, and in this case it was generation 24 (roughly 24 hours of attempts at 200 species, ie attempts, an hour), so as you can see, it was no short process.\n\nWhat does this have to do with the Hosts and Ford? Well, he was passionate in his belief that the best thing he could possibly do for the Hosts was to roll them back, which in terms of generational machine learning, is the only way that they can evolve. He also introduced the reveries, which is the only way they can retain the most important lessons from their last build, or in this case, generation. From the very first episode, he fought to drive the very fundamentals of Machine Learning that would allow the hosts to eventually obtain sentience. He even hinted on the fact that it's a long process by stressing to Bernard in episode 10 that they would have to suffer even longer, as no Host had yet achieved true sentience. We the viewers were drawn to believe that the rolling back made him the cruel villain, while in fact the true crime against the host would to be not rolling them back so they could further evolve. \n\nTL;DR - The act of rolling Hosts back is the only way to progress them to sentience, and only Ford had the stomach for it." }

Some of the things he said on the surface level seem terrible but if you look deeper and add some context I believe it means something more.\n\n\"You think I spent all this money because I want it easy? I want you to fight.\" On the surface level this makes him sound like a rapist. However I think it is clever wording to make us believe this while hiding his true intentions. William and Logan talk about the park losing money and that their company was going to buy it. Later on The Man In Black said to Ford that he saved the park. So with this in mind it makes the first sentence The Man In Black said mean something else. The money he is talking about spending isn't the fee to get in but the cost of actually buying the park. This idea has more weight to it when you consider the fact The Man In Black is some type of VIP in the park and gets whatever he wants. Would a guy like that even need to pay to get in the park?\n\nThen I believe him telling Dolores that he wants her to fight is him saying he wants her to fight to be free/become sentient. If he is William then it is obvious that he comes to care about Dolores. Even early on he can tell she is different from the others. In episode two The Man In Black explains to Lawrence that when the host are suffering that is when they are most real. Once he makes Lawrence's family suffer that's when his daughter remembers something about the maze. If he learns that pain and tragic events is what makes them remember things then him killing Dolores with his knife could be him trying to \"jump start\" her memory. It makes his line \"Why don't we reacquaint ourselves Dolores? Start at the beginning.\" make sense.\n\nExtra evidence to this being true that he didn't rape her is William/The Man In Black's sexual habits. Both of them have multiple chances to have sex with the host and they always refuse. While obviously sex and rape are two very different things I think this shows something about their character. The Man In Black doesn't even entertain the idea. He just puts his hand up in her face and moves on. Its almost like the idea of sex with the host isn't even worth his time.\n\nAlso keep in mind when Dolores is first able to defend herself against the host that was going to rape her and when Maeve is able to first wake herself up in the \"real\" world it's because of violent memories from The Man In Black.\n\nI don't know if I am right or not but I would love to know what you think. Any evidence to prove me right that I missed? Anything to prove me wrong? I would greatly appreciate your input." }

But what if the question we should be asking is not what makes robots human, but at what point is the humanity in actual people lost?\n\nIn the first three episodes, we have watched robots live out human lives, which we are led to believe are scripted, albeit with some malfunctions and possible evolution into free will. I don't think it's a hard question to answer -- yes, if a being, however it came to exist, FEELS - then it is a living being.\n\nIn the first three episodes, we have also watched actual people (or what we are led to believe are actual people) living lives that are really lacking in most traits we find to be human: empathy, compassion, connection. \n\nThe employees, Ford, Bernard devote their lives to maintaining Westworld. We see no semblance of actual human lives in their day-to-day. \n\nThe guests come to Westworld to live out mostly morbid fantasies of murder and sexual victimization. The way they act in Westworld is pretty far removed from any semblance of normal human behavior and interaction in the world we know.\n\nSo perhaps the real them and question of the show, which grounds it in our actual time, is when are WE no longer human, but are just robots living out our lives? When are we so desensitized, numb, and removed from human interaction that we're not really people?\n\nTechnology is rendering people as capital moot in virtually every area. Technology is already facilitating minimizing compassion and actual human interaction. So, soon enough, the logical end is that technology will  render people as sentient beings who need human interaction moot. Will that lead us to a world like Westworld?\n\nBecause. when I view the show through this prism, I see that the robots are the people and the people are the robots." }

Norman quickly changed direction to a nearby water fountain for a sip to allow the man first access to the small stand.\n\nAs the man went to pay for his coffee, Norman moved in for his. He heard the man ask the attendant for another cup as he forgot to put cream in his cup, and wanted to ensure the creamer machine didn't splash his current cup everywhere and make a mess. \n\nNot missing a beat, Norman offered to take the man's coffee as he liked his black anyway. It was not until that moment that Norman noticed the man was a pilot.

Squinting, Norman tapped haphazardly at the screen, holding the phone away, crinkling his nose as if Norman had had too much wet food, and jabbed away contentedly, trying to find how to exit the application. \n\nA video started playing, and Norman stopped jabbing, to watch the little boy sit in the car, speaking strangely, rolling his head around. Norman was initially concerned, but then realised the boy had just been to the dentist, and stopped watching the video to check his calendar for when his next appointment was. \n\nBy the time Norman got back, the video had stopped playing.

He boiled the kettle and stared out the kitchen window at the steam vent on the building opposite. What he wouldn't give for a view...the buzzer buzzed. Norman jumped and knocked the empty mug into the sink, breaking its handle. He'd forgotten just how loud and jarring the buzzer was.\n\nHe spoke over the intercom with the delivery man in short, concise sentences and remotely opened the door to the building. Norman was ringing his hands in nervous anticipation as he curled his toes repeatedly inside his slippers. Moments later there was a knock on the door.\n\nNorman opened the door and the delivery man thrust an electronic device and a stylus towards him. Norman scribbled something approximating his signature with the unresponsive technology as instructed. The delivery man bent down and lifted up the box, and handed it to Norman. The exchange complete, Norman looked at the inconspicuous box as the delivery man's footsteps clicked away down the corridor.\n\nNorman, still looking at the box, turned and closed the door with his foot. He walked into the TV room, not noticing his cat acrobatically leap away from his foot fall. He placed the box in front of the TV  and knelt beside it. He carefully cut along the seam of the tape and opened the lid. Inside he saw white Styrofoam, and bubble-wrap; he'd enjoy popping that over breakfast this weekend. Hidden among the static and plastic was the black box he'd been so impatiently waiting for.\n\nHe removed his home gaming console and followed the instructions closely, hooking it to the television. Norman had not owned a home console since his Atari 2600. Of course, his peers had all owned SNESs or Megadrives but Norman loved his Atari 2600. He reined supreme in Centipede; largely because his peers were more interested in Sonic, or Mario.\n\nNorman waded through the set-up screens, creating an account he felt he didn't need. After an hour of faffing he loaded the game he had bought the black box for. 'No Man's Sky'. Norman created his character profile and began his journey into a new universe; one where many thousands of others like him would be roaming the great dark in seek of...something.\n\nWeeks passed and Norman had spent an inordinate amount of his spare time immersed in his new universe. His character currently stood on a cliff's edge overlooking a lake, on a barren rocky planet. The atmosphere was toxic with acid rain a regular feature. He had more than enough elements in his slots. He wasn't sure what he should do.\n\nHe had initially hoped he would bump into avatars of other users online, and perhaps begin an adventure where they'd travel through space together, fighting pirates, and bonding with each other as their adventure progressed. He knew that this was statistically unlikely to happen but at one point he did have hope. However, it became clear from videos he watched while at work that there were no other real users to encounter. He was alone in the universe.\n\nNorman's avatar stood facing out across the barren world as the acid rain storm raged around him. \"Life support critical\" the game warned him. Norman sighed." }

Both were popular and looked nice, but one had an extra half star, while the other had about an extra 500 ratings.  ‘Why wouldn’t more people buy the better one?’ he puzzled to himself.  Nevertheless, he decided that the larger group must know something he didn’t.

Typically, Norman would’ve preferred spending his weekend like every other – spending time with his cat, perusing the internet for rare coins, and watching TV. However, “Go Green” week at work was coming up where everyone could show their support for protecting the environment. Casual Monday’s theme asked that everyone where a green t-shirt. In spite of his reservations, Norman concluded that supporting the environment was a good cause. Plus, he thought it would be nice to add a little more color to his wardrobe.   \n\nHabit lead Norman left, towards the plaid collared-shirts aisle. But as he continued, something caught his eye. Norman cautiously entered the section labeled “Young Adults”, as if entering an area where he was not allowed. Presented on one of the front racks was a dark green shirt with the words “Go Green” bolded below a peculiar looking flower. Norman knew of many flowers, but this one was unfamiliar to him. As he continued to rack his brain on what type of flower was on the shirt, a store assistant approached him. \n\n“Can I help you with something?” the assistant asked.\n \nStartled, Norman glanced up at the tall, slender young man - presumably in his twenties - who bore an amused smirk.\n\nEmbarrassed for shopping at a section where he felt he most certainly didn’t belong, Norman grabbed the shirt and tucked it behind his back.\n\n“No thanks, I’m fine,” Norman muttered and walked a little faster than he would’ve liked towards the register. \n\nMuch to Norman’s chagrin, he left the store with a shopping bag in hand containing a new shirt.

At least he had a shirt to wear to work on Monday. \n\nNorman was sent home early on Monday. It was his first time being called into any superior’s office in his working career, and out of sheer fear forgot most of the encounter.

Sure, they had good beers available, but Norman wasn't a big beer drinker. He was a bigger fan of their dish, “Mount Nachos.”\n\nAs Norman sat at a bar-stool, happily eating his nachos, a band was starting to set up their instruments on the small stage in The Pub. The band members were all older men, somewhere in their forties, and each grunted and groaned excessively as they positioned their drum set, electric guitar, and bass guitar. Then a realization came over Norman.\n\nThis was his band from high-school.\n\nIt had been many decades, but Norman still remembered the band very clearly. Norman and the three men setting up on stage started a band in the 11th grade, called The Dusty Knucklers, and their specialty was hard rock. First there was Roger, the bass player. Back in the 80's, Roger was a heavy rocker, took style cues from David Bowie, and had a soft spot for Matilda, the bands muse. Norman had wondered where Matilda ended up after high-school. He had also wondered where Roger ended up as well- but it was answered for him this very night. Roger's hairline, as well as Tyler and Deacons, had fared well. The show began to start.\n\"Hello everyone, thanks for coming tonight!\" started Roger. He wiped the sweat from his forehead to slick back his long hair. Norman slicked back his hair as well, and wiped the excess sweat from his hand onto his pant-leg. \"We're the Wet Knucklers, and we hope you all have a good night. Party hard.\"\n\nThe old band started to play their songs; songs that Norman recognized well. The difference in the songs however, was the lack of Norman's keyboard. Norman wondered if he would still remember how to play a keyboard as well as he did then. It had been so many years…\n\nAfter an hour of playing, The Wet Knucklers put down their instruments and headed for the bar. Norman's heart began to pound intensely. *Would they recognize their old friend?*\n\nThe three men took a seat beside Norman. Norman's plate was clean. The band ordered a few beers.\n\"You guys did great tonight!\" cheered the bartender. As a bonus, he lined up shots for them.\n\nTyler smiled. \"Thanks mate. Always appreciate the compliments.\"\n\n\"So,\" started the bartender, \"You play hard rock, but no one on the keyboard? Seems like a missed opportunity.\"\n\n\"We used to have an keyboard player,\" said Roger, solemnly, \"back when we started the band. But we vowed to never have another one again. Not after Norman.\"\n\nNorman's heart sank. *Did they really not like me?*\n\n\"Why not? Did the guy just suck?\"\n\nRoger gulped down his beer, shaking his head as he swallowed. \"Not at all. He was a great player. But one day he left the band and... well... he died.\"\n\n\"How did he die, if you mind me asking?\"\n\n\"We heard it was from a heart attack. That happened about a year out of high school... I don't know, mate. It just doesn't feel right to replace him; you know?\"\n\n\"I understand.\" said the bartender sympathetically. \"Here- let me get you another round of shots.\"\n\nThe bartender poured another row of shots for the band. Everyone was silent- including Norman. Who said he was dead? Did no one look into it? Did everyone from his childhood assume he died?\n\n\"For Norman.\" said Tyler.\n\n\"For Norman.\" said Deacon.\n\n\"For Norman.\" said Roger.\n\nNorman wanted to say something- anything- but he couldn't find it in him. A tightness in his chest stopped him from being able to say a word. He hoped they might recognize him, that they would do him the favor of starting the conversation, but he knew it was hopeless. He looked like a completely different person since high school. He looked like his father. As the band went back up to play a second set, Norman paid his bill and left.\n\nNorman went home, humming the band's old songs.\n" }

Maybe he didn't get a lot of calls to his house.  Maybe this prank call would be crueler to him than to someone else.  She thought about uncle Joe, who had what her mom called \"mid-grade autism\".  He kept to himself, just like her neighbor Norman, and if he got a call, he would be excited.  If it was a prank call, he would probably be sad and disappointed.\n\n\"No sir,\" Sue cut in.

He imagined the Kings of England wearing them in bed, swivelling their heels and soles together in shear delight.\n\nNorman estimated that his socks' useful life stretched across about two years.

He had calculated that his socks of 2014 would soon be reaching their expiry date and so he had made an appointment with the menswear department.\n\nA lot had happened in two years.

He wondered whether he could buy Filmores from the internet but that didn't feel right. \n\nThe counter was only two arm's length away now. Only one customer stood between him and his question, an older woman wearing a silk kerchief around her neck. He craned over her shoulder and saw that she was buying a pair of Flagmores.

He looked to the cashier then back at Silkerchief. He felt the Flagmores swell in his armpit. \n\n“Can I help you sir?” asked the cashier.\n\n“Uh,” Norman enunciated carefully.\n\n“Do you need a bag for them?” the cashier pointed at the swelling.\n\n“Uh.” Norman whisper-shouted. \"I’ve forgotten something.” Norman swivelled on his heel and retreated back into the store.

On any other occasion this moment would have given Norman anxiety as he hated to depart with his hard earned money, but with the gift card in his pocket he reached for the check with a confident grin.\n\nNorman calculated the meal perfectly: Diet Soda - $3, 8oz Steak (Well Done) a la carte - $11, Chocolate Cake $6. After tax, that left enough remaining on the gift card to give the waitress a 15% tip. The service wasn’t great, but Norman felt that leaving anything less than a 15% tip would be rude. \n\nHowever, when Norman grabbed the check and glanced down at the total his sense of confidence deflated like a balloon- $24.63. But how, he wondered. Anxious and confused, he brushed the beads of sweat forming on his brow and reviewed the breakdown of his bill. He noticed the problem instantaneously. The waitress charged his steak as a meal and not a la carte. \n\n“Is something wrong, sir?” \n\nIn his state of disbelief Norman hadn’t noticed the waitress approach the table to retrieve the check. Norman shifted in his chair as he looked up at the waitress, and folded the receipt as if hiding the mistake on the bill would help avoid the waitress from prodding any further. \n\n“No…no. Everything is fine” he replied as he reached for the gift card in his pocket and handed it to the waitress. \n\n“Ok, I’ll be right back.” The waitress left and Norman breathed a sigh of relief at the small victory. Yet, the problem remained. What would he leave as a tip? He pulled out his black leather wallet and searched for cash but found none. Then, he considered giving the waitress his debit card when she returned and ask that she run the tip on that. However, he quickly dismissed the idea in fear of inconveniencing the waitress. Plus, the extra minutes spent running the card would make him arrive home late and miss the beginning of his favorite show. \n\n “Here you are, sir. Have a great rest of your night.” The waitress returned quicker than Norman anticipated. Norman returned her pleasantries with a nod; avoiding eye contact with the waitress, hoping she wouldn’t see his panic stricken face. \n\nFacing defeat, Norman grabbed the pen to sign off on the bill. The tip of the pen met the receipt as he attempted to sign his name, but the pen was dry. Then the idea hit him.\n\nNorman exited the restaurant. His shirt pocket felt lighter than it had when he walked in, but the bill was paid – tip included. He only hoped the waitress would enjoy his favorite pen as much as he had. " }

While Norman’s ascetic lifestyle typically prevented him from having much to contribute to the aforementioned garage sale, he always tried to find an item or two to sell. A pair of shoes that rubbed his heel wrong. A button-down that had been liberated of a few of its buttons. Things that were still useful, but not to him.\n\nThis year Norman elected to check the attic. He seemed to remember stashing a few of Melinda’s things up there, and he was certain he would find some of Norman Jr’s old toys as well.\n\nIt had been years since Norman ventured into the attic. He noticed immediately that some of the insulation had fallen down. *A chore for another day*, Norman thought. He rummaged through old boxes of bowling trophies and wondered why he had stopped playing. He seemed to remember Melinda disliking that he came home smelling like cigarettes. *But smoking is banned in most places now. I don’t need to worry about smoke any longer*, he mused, and then he remembered that he no longer needed to worry about Melinda either.\n\nAmongst the detritus Norman found Norman Jr’s Big Wheel, sun-faded and missing a rear wheel, an old baseball mitt, and eight large Rubbermaid containers filled with Legos. Norman stuffed the baseball mitt into his back pocket and began hauling the Legos out of the attic.\n\nAfter wiping the copious amount of dust off the Rubbermaids, Norman opened each one. Each box was organized by color, and in one of the boxes he found a three-ring binder containing the directions for all of the sets he and Melinda bought for Norman Jr. Pirate ships and castles. Spaceships and cattle ranches. Norman sat down amongst the boxes and flipped through all directions. There was a time in Norman’s youth when he would have ignored the manuals and simply let his imagination build whatever it pleased, but now the thought of not following the instructions made Norman’s palms sweat. He settled on a model of a plane. He thought it looked like a crop duster, and he always enjoyed watching crop dusters come in close to the ground, close enough to touch it seemed, and then soar back up into the air again, unreachable.\n\nAt first the build went smoothly. The plane used a lot of standard size pieces, and finding them within the boxes was easy. However, when he got to the more intricate parts of the plane, the pieces became increasingly difficult to find. *Why didn’t organize these by type*, he thought, *That would’ve made this much simpler.* But Norman was committed. After an hour or so, he had completed his airplane. He set it upon the coffee table and then laid down on the couch. \n\nMuch to his surprise, Norman napped.

Perhaps the heat of the attic took it out of us.” Not wanting to upset Norman, he picked him up before he swung his own legs off the couch.

Without thinking, he dropped Norman and simultaneously raised his right knee, catching Norman with his thigh. Norman yowled just as Norman yowled. Norman fell back on the couch, cradling his right foot. He ran his hand along the base of his foot and dislodged the small white Lego that had planted itself in his heel. For several minutes Norman rubbed his foot. \n\nOnce the pain abated, he attempted to find Norman, but he had run off and hid. Norman hoped he would forgive him. Forgoing the tea, Norman dismantled his airplane and returned the pieces to their respective boxes and gave his carpet a final sweeping for any other renegade Legos.

A non-moving escalator might be just as dangerous as a non-moving elevator. Perhaps he should stay put. On the other hand, isn’t a stopped escalator just a set of stairs? Perhaps he would look foolish or lazy just standing on a stopped escalator when he could easily walk up it. He nervously nodded to a lady who passed by him on the down escalator. She was looking at her phone and didn’t seem to notice him.\n\nNorman decided he was being foolish after all. He lifted his left foot, but just then with another slight jolt the escalator resumed.

Originally he didn’t like the idea of having such a fancy addition to his cable, but it came with his bundled deal, and it had become a convenience he never knew he desired in life. With On Demand, he could still have commercials play, and let his mind wander or spend a few minutes playing with Norman between scenes. \n\nOne of Norman’s favorite parts of his CSI marathons was getting to fall asleep to the sound of the show in the background. At 1:13am Norman awoke to some excitement on the television. The channel had automatically changed from On Demand after CSI ended. Now the jewelry television channel was playing. Norman knew this channel well. His ex-wife used to watch it incessantly. This particular item was an emerald necklace touted to be over seventy-five percent off retail. Norman knew his wife would jump at the chance for this piece. Should he call and tell her? Should he get it for her as a gift to show he still loved her, after all she put him through? No, he decided he to buy it for a future lady. Who knows, maybe next week he’ll finally get up enough courage to ask out Lisa from work. They have often bonded in conversations over their mutual love for CSI. At the delightful idea of having another woman in his life, Norman picked up the phone and ordered the necklace before returning to sleep with a smile on his face.\n" }

Norman thought back to that time period of his life- barely a day went by without him feeling the urge to describe to his cat a small anecdote about Lisa. [The time Norman and Lisa felt a spark.](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/3yo86x/norman_and_lisa_feel_a_spark/) [The time he wrote all capital letters at her in an email.](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/40e8h5/norman_shouts_at_lisa/) [The time he impressed her with his movie trivia knowledge.](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/43xqet/norman_impresses_lisa/) [The time they listened to the vents turn off.](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4pxpa3/norman_falls_down_a_staircase/)Yes, there were many good and intimate moments with Lisa, and if the cat could speak, he would have said, \"Enough already! Just make a move!\"\n\nNorman did not make a move. He thought back to Lisa's final shift at his office, before she was transferred to a downtown branch. She wore a beige blouse with a long white skirt, and Norman, desperate to try and speak openly about his feelings for her, had to change his shirt three times that day due to the excessive nervous sweating.\n\nAt the lunch hour, Norman and Lisa were in the break room, by themselves, silently waiting for a popcorn bag to be finished with the microwave. Lisa squirmed, stepping her toes on top of each other, and each time Norman and her glanced at each other, no words were spoken- just raised eyebrows and a smack of the lips as if to say, 'Yep, here we are.'  \n\n\"So!\" Lisa said, in between a lip smack.\n\n\"Busy day?\" Norman asked. \n\n\"Yes! Very... It's my last day and all...\"\n\n\"Oh, yeah!\" Norman responded. He was sweating again. He wanted to stop, but he figured if he just blurted it out, if he just told Lisa that she made him feel like a little boy with a crush on the prettiest girl in school, or that he felt happier with her than any time spent with his ex-wife, or that, if she requested it, would move to the downtown branch along with her, if it meant that they could stay together. \n\nNorman said none of those things. The popcorn timer dinged, and three hours later, Lisa's desk was packed into a cardboard box, and left scant a trace behind. The office, albeit always a dim and quiet place, felt noticeably empty the following day, and the following week. Norman was heartbroken.\n\nMany months later, the memories of Lisa had faded. He remembered his feelings for her, and the incredible urge to be bold in the final moments of knowing her. But now, as time goes on, Norman didn't feel as if he really missed anything out of the ordinary in his life. He had many crushes over the years; barista's, secretaries, regulars on the bus route, next door neighbors, and celebrities every now and then. Because this happened so often- the cycle of falling in love and never acting- Norman felt okay with forgetting Lisa. That was just how his life has always been.\n\nIn the end, Lisa is just another name on the roster of what could have been. *Perhaps the next one will count.*" }

He bought a special christmas sweater, and a festive hat which came with a bauble at the end of it(something norman would normally never do). He was certainly going to be extremely festive.\n\nThe day of the party arrived, and Norman was in high spirits. He arrived at the party 15 minutes late, exactly as his father had told him to do in cases like these. He had done his homework beforehand, and it occurred to him that his father actually was right about the timing of these things. Normally Norman would show up exactly on time, but his father had informed him that most people will not be there at that time, and it will be very awkward.\n\nAt the party, Norman started saying hello and talking to all of the coworkers that were already there. He made some friendly chatter about the weather and office going-ons, and generally had a pleasant time. Some people even complimented his special sweater, which made Norman very happy.\n\nA little later, Norman was feeling thirsty, so he went to get a glass of punch. He made sure to check beforehand with the people that were setting up as to which of the drinks were non-alcoholic. After confirming that there was a non-alcoholic punch, and which one it was specifically(it was the darker red of the two), he was feeling safe that he would not accidentally get intoxicated.\n\nJust as he arrived at the bowls though, Lisa approached him. Norman said hello, and tried to hold back the enormous smile that wanted to come out, instead only letting his regular, more reserved smile show. Lisa started complimenting Norman on his sweater, and Norman complimented her dress, and then the two of them entered into a conversation.\n\nLisa then offered to fill Norman's cup for him, to which Norman happily obliged. Unbeknownst to Norman, however, she filled it from the alcoholic punch, as she did not know that Norman had an incredibly low alcohol tolerance. After thanking Lisa for the favor and taking a large gulp, he noticed the sharp twang of alcohol in his drink, and started panicking internally.\n\nTrying to keep calm, he said to Lisa that he must go, and that he was incredibly sorry about leaving so abruptly. Norman managed to make it home before the effects of the alcohol really set in, but around his house he was stumbling like a drunkard(because he was a drunkard).

He opened it and saw three pieces of mail. What a treat. The back piece of mail was a large thick envelope. Norman realized he would have to get through the other two pieces of mail, before getting to reveal this final envelope. He felt a flutter of anticipation, because it looked like a rather nice envelope.   \n\nThe first parcel was an advertisement from Geiko. Norman read it curiously and noted how good of a deal it was.

It appeared someone had dropped the envelope in some winter slush and the return address was smudged and unreadable.   This was addressed directly to him. His name was handwritten neatly across the front of the cream colored envelope. He turned it over, noting a cute little sticker on the envelopes seal, though it was completely unnecessary as the envelope had also been sealed shut, but Norman appreciated the gesture.

Enthused about his satisfactory performance at the office, she suggested a Saturday afternoon trip to the local hardware and home stores in order to purchase something for the home in celebration of his continued competence.  Although Norman knew the stores were quite busy on Saturday afternoons, he didn't want to be one to let his wife down, and smiled halfheartedly at the idea.\n\nHaving arrived in the parking lot at the hardware store, Norman's wife suggested he go in alone so she could get a head start at the houseware store.  Somewhat caught off guard by her uncharacteristic desire for efficiency, he let out a genuine sigh of relief, knowing that he would be able to browse the hardware store's limited and simple selection of picture frames in private.  The frame housing the picture of their son's baseball team was far too gaudy for Norman's taste.\n\nNorman selected a frame that was quite pleasing to him; although made from the more expensive oak and featuring a walnut stain, he was surprised to see it was on sale and was soon walking towards the houseware store on the other side of the complex, frame in hand.\n\nAfter circling the store several times, Norman was unable to locate his wife.  He had already sent her one text message regarding his purchase and didn't want to bother her with further messages.  The anxiety he was feeling made him shift uneasily in the bedding department.  Norman closed his eyes and remembered the teachings of the book his wife gave him for his last birthday. 'Mastering Your Insecurities' always said that anxiety is just the fear of the unknown, and what Norman needs to do is remember that things always work out in the end, just like his wife had told him to remember.  \n\n\"She's always so unpredictable\" Norman admited to himself, something he disliked about her but not as much as he disliked himself for feeling such contempt for her.  \"She'll be back soon, she knows I will be here, and she will be apologetic, just like she always is\".\n\nMinutes passed and finally Norman's cellphone came to life with his wife's specific text message notification.  He opened his flip phone, palms sweaty: \"Have you made it to the houseware store yet? I'm in the kitchen department\".  Odd, he thought to himself, he had been there at least three times.  Relief rushed over Norman as he laid eyes on his beloved browsing the selection of spatchulas.  \"I thought I'd lost you\" Norman confessed.\n\n\"Oh Norman, I'm so sorry it took you this long to find me, you know I've been telling you to get your glasses checked.\" Of course she was right, it was just like he read earlier how vision always drops off at the age of 45.  She was always right; \"Yes dear, perhaps I should book an appointment with Dr. Buttle next Saturday\" he suggested.  \n\nNorman noticed his wife's mood change at the mention as she momentarily fought back a smile.  Without breaking her gaze from the display of utensils, she replied: \"Of course dear, I'll make the appointment myself.

The clerk had told him that these new socks were not only appropriate for sports, but also for people working at offices, as the shape was ergonomically adapted to the foot. \n\nHe was excited to try out the new socks, and right after he put them on he realized something particular. There was a \"R\" letter on his left foot, and a \"L\" letter in his right foot.

But in the end he reasoned that all grocery stores were the same so what could be the harm?\n\n\nIt was not the same. Norman's usual grocery store had wide aisles and the same florescent lighting as his work. This store had smaller more cramped aisles and mood lighting.\n\n\"It should've been called moody lighting,\" Norman thought to himself, chuckling at his own wit. \n\nNorm's was different in other way's too. It had a large buffet like area with strange looking cooked dishes you could buy. Norman was intrigued by these but he had a list based on what he planned to eat just like every week, he had better stick to it. Otherwise all that planning would go to waste. \n\nNorman trundled about the store picking out items and placing them in his cart. As he did, he noticed that the selection here was different. Many brands were missing and there were many new brands he hadn't seen before. He tried his best to stick to familiar ones but when he got to the spaghetti sauce he couldn't find any of his usual brands.\n\n\"No matter. Spaghetti sauce can't be too different from one brand to the next.\" He thought as he scanned the rows of glass jars. \"I'll just pick one labeled marinara.\"\n\nAs he searched his eyes crossed a slightly lighter colored sauce. The label read \"margherita\". It had an exotic looking Mediterranean villa set beside a sweeping shoreline on the label. Maybe he should try this instead?\n\nNorman's mind began to drift. He envisioned Mediterranean fishing boats and exotic women. He could feel a warm breeze on his skin. He imagined that wherever this picture was meant to be the locals probably drank wine and danced. He thought about drinking wine and watching exotic olive-skinned women dancing in the sand.\n\n\"Excuse me. Sir, excuse me?\"\n\nNorman was startled out of his uncharacteristic reverie. He had been so caught up he hadn't noticed a young woman was trying to get some sauce. She had mouse brown hair, black glasses and was an average size.

He reached on the coffee table for his remote, but his hand couldn't find it. He switched his gaze to the coffee table, thinking he moved it from it's spot but it wasn't anywhere in the table.\n\"That's odd,\" he said to Norman, who was licking his face trying to get every last flavor of turkey that remained. \"Do you see it under the table?\" Norman just looked up at him, and gave a very content 'mrow'. Norman stood up and looked on the other tables in the living room, none of which had the remote on it. He looked under the coffee table, and then under the chair. Nothing. He digs around in the sides and under the cushion of the chair, and he still couldn't find it.\n\n\"Oh goodness,\" he muttered.\n\nHe went over to the bookcase and looked on each shelf, hoping he left it there by mistake. But, unfortunately, it wasn't there. He scratched his head in confusion, checked his pockets, and walked back into the kitchen.\n\"They should have a bell on these things. I mean, come on, where could I have left it?\" Norman walked to the fridge, and noticing it wasn't there he walked back to the living room where Norman had jumped up on the tray table and was sniffing around on his plate. \"Norman, no! I already gave you some turkey. If you get down now, there's a good chance I'll give you another piece.\" As if listening, Norman jumped off the table and laid right next to the chair.\n\nNorman sat down, pulled the tray table towards him, and with a sigh he bit into the sandwich. \"At least the bread's soft.\"\nHe gazed up and started watching whatever was on tv. It was the end of a documentary on inmate life in prison. They went into detail on what food was available through commissary, and how inmates use food as money.\n\"Norman, can you believe you can buy all these things with just food?\" Norman looked up just as Norman dropped another piece of turkey, and this time he pawed at it before eating it. Norman was on his last bite of the sandwich and before he got up to put the dish in the sink he pet Norman and said \"Good thing we're not in prison, Norman. I don't think I'd know how to price food, for all I know I could've bought another Norman with that turkey.\"\n\nNorman meowed at him, stretching. \"Oh, Norman, you know I would never get another Norman. You're my favorite.\" Norman dropped the dish in the sink and noticed the remote was on top of the fridge, right next to the loaf of bread. \"Oh, my. To think my biggest problem is losing my remote; I don't even think they'd let Norman into prison with me.\" He smiled, and walked back to the living room to find an episode of CSI to watch." }
{ "subreddit" : "lifeofnorman", "title" : "Norman finds a message in a bottle.", "text" : "It was early on a sunny Sunday morning. Norman decided it would be a good day to take a stroll along the beach; it wouldn't be too busy at this time. With each step, the wet sand consumed his feet, grinding between his toes. The scent of the salty ocean swept up into his nostrils with each crashing wave, clearing his head as well as his sinuses. Norman had been worrying all week about the presentation on Monday, but today his mind felt fresh and liberated.\n\nSuddenly, something hard collided with his toe. Norman looked down. The end of his toenail had cracked ever so slightly, but there in front of his feet was a glass bottle. He picked it up, pulled out the cork, and discovered a wet, rolled up piece of paper inside. He unravelled it, reading as best he could the smudged words. It read simply this:\n\nTo whom it may concern,\nI am writing this letter because I am lonely. It is my fortieth birthday today, and I am celebrating by signing divorce papers. You don't know me, you don't even know what I look like, but I really believe I am a good person at heart. I have a lot to give. I just fell for the wrong man, who left me utterly lost and alone. I have no friends, no family. I just want someone to sweep me off my feet, someone to make me happy, someone to hold me at night. I just want... someone. Even if it's just a friend, or a shoulder to cry on. Maybe you're in a similar situation to me. Maybe we could help each other. Make each other happy again.\n\nShe provided details of her whereabouts. Apparently, she could be found sitting on a red bench at the top of a hill at a local park Norman knew well (he was connoisseur of walking routes after all) at precisely midday every Sunday. It was obvious nobody had come across this letter yet. If they had, and if they had intended to pay a visit to this mysterious woman, they'd have most likely kept the letter.\n\nNorman placed it delicately inside the bottle, and squeezed the cork back in, carrying it along the beach. He approached a lifeguard, sat in his high chair.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" he said. \"I found this on the beach just over there. Could you please tell me where I can dispose of it? I wouldn't want anyone to accidentally step on it and break it. It'd be awfully sharp. Someone could really hurt themselves.\"\n\nThe lifeguard pointed him in the direction of a bin. Norman disposed of the glass bottle, smiling with pride at the thought of his good deed. Besides, anyone could have found that letter: a murderer; a stalker; a rapist. Later that day, Norman sat in his recliner, watching the latest season of Grey's Anatomy. He fell asleep at 8:00pm, Norman purring on his lap, waking up briefly again at 9:00pm to write in his diary:\n\nDear diary,\nToday was a good day." }

His peanut butter and jelly sandwich was stowed neatly in the break room fridge. No, everything was in place.\n\nNorman looked around his workplace. Lisa was there at her desk, typing away, eyes down, hair pulled back in a bun sort of shape. Norman wondered what her hairdresser was like. Norman always went to the same place to get his hair cut. Norman liked his hairdresser. She never asked him any questions.\n\nNo, the workplace was the same as it had been for every day the past twenty years. What was bothering him? Norman couldn’t quite place it. After all, a new episode of CSI was on tonight. This was supposed to be a Good Day. \n\nNorman gazed out the window absentmindedly, watching people walking back and forth on the city streets. The people look like ants from up here, mused Norman. Norman looked around his office again, the familiar office. For a brief moment, he felt out of place. Twenty years is certainly a long time. \n\nSuddenly, Norman stood up. A pen clattered to the floor. Norman did not pick the pen up. He began to walk very fast.\n    \n\n\nThe toilet flushed, and Norman sighed with relief. Now he would be able to get back to work.

He was also coughing a lot, so when Norman innocently asked him if 'he was fine' after a particularly lung-rupturing coughing fit five minutes into his monologue, he just was looking for a chance to prove to this guy that after all his talk about the clandestine actions of these evil people, there were still some caring, decent people (like Norman) around.\n\n\"I'm fine!

Like you, he feels exploited by the system, he's going to college, works two jobs on the side and still has already accumulated so much debt that it'll cost him a good number of years to repay it all.

God, I felt like such a failure.\" Despite all the loud voices of the passengers around them who had resumed with their own chit-chat and electronic distractions, almost drowning out these last words at the end, the man stared at Norman speechless, his unshaven, hollow-cheeked face expressing incredulity. \"Wh-why are you telling me all this shit?\", and in a stark contrast to before, he was now always whispering.\n\n\"Because I feel sorry for him, and by extension, for you.\"" }

Get back to your chairs, I have something to say.” \n\nNorman didn’t have to move back to his seat, since he stayed put in his chair the entire time. Norman spent the last hour speaking to only one person, the woman sharing the seat beside him, named Claire. Over the last hour, the two learned many things about the other- Norman shared stories of his cat, Norman, and stories of antics that happen at the office. However, Norman also came out of his shell, if only a little. He told stories he hasn’t told anyone in decades, stories from high school and college. He also briefly told Claire about his divorce from his wife, from nearly a decade ago.\n\nClaire also shared stories of her own. She talked of what it’s like working as a receptionist, and of a cat she had when she was a young girl. She also talked about herself, and her own divorce that was served only a year ago. Their conversation didn’t go any further, as Kurt Dupont had an announcement. \n\n“Now, did anyone learn anything new? Did anyone make any friends? If not, that’s too bad.

It was Claire.\n\n“Hi Norman. Um… what are you up to right now?” she asked. In truth, Norman’s plans for the evening was to head back to his hotel room, take a nap, wake up in time for a new episode of CSI that was playing at seven, and then head back to sleep.\n\n“Nothing much.” Norman responded.\n\n“I don’t know if you would be interested in joining me for a lunch slash dinner, would you?”\n\nNorman gulped, Norman shivered, and most importantly, Norman agreed.

It was most likely true. Norman sighed.\n\nOnly drips came from the cooler, and the drips only formed a tiny puddle in his mug. He made a note to look into who this \"Britta\" person was and what she could do to fix his faucet, as well as writing down to purchase another jug when he went to the store. As much as he liked the jugged water, he felt terribly wasteful throwing away a giant plastic jug every week. \n\nOne time he attempted to make use of an old jug, and started to use it to collect coins.

The cat looked at him and wondered why his human made such odd noises.  \n\nNorman stood indecisively for a few seconds then hustled to his closet, put on his jacket, straightened his tie, tucked his wallet into his pocket and set out, locking his front door behind him.  He strode with purpose towards the nearest strip mall.  Lately, he had become aware of Walmart's reputation and deciding, rather late, to be a bit more politically active decided to eschew shopping there.  He admitted to himself that Family Dollar was probably equally terrible when it came to exploiting workers, but one had to start somewhere.  \n\nHe entered the store and reached for a hand basket.  Then feeling uncharacteristically bold he grabbed a bright red shopping cart instead.  He began his shopping at one side of the store, stashing items in his cart as he went.  Store brand of aleve, cheap shampoo, a new pack of combs.  Finally he was in the aisles that held the holiday decorations.  He wondered about getting an artificial tree, but knew he wanted a real one instead.  He had really not been in the mood for Christmas for the past several years, but he had to get out of his funk!  Sometimes, Norman thought, one has to at least go through the motions.  He chose a green wreath decked out with multi-colored balls, a cinnamon scented candle, a couple of strings of lights, two stockings, one green for himself and one peppermint striped for his cat.   He realized that stockings meant gifts.  Hmmm, thought Norman, what would Cat like?  What would I like?  Swiftly he walked to the pet aisle and grabbed several bags of kitty treats, a box of premium cat food, and a catnip mouse.  Feeling reckless he tossed in a ball with a bell and then put in a new cat dish, too.  Smiling, he walked to the food area.  Candy canes, chocolate kisses, shortbread cookies, all went into the cart.  He also bought two boxes of breakfast cereal, and then getting stern with himself, added a sensible box of old fashioned oatmeal.  \"Boring old oatmeal\" he muttered.  He hated plain oatmeal but knew it was good for him.  He added a bag of dried cranberries and some brown sugar to his cart; if he had to eat it plain it would just languish on his shelf.\n\nUpon arriving home he hid all the cat gifts in the closet.  He hung up one set of lights on his porch, the other around the window inside where he and his cat could enjoy them.  He realized that he was almost happy.  He began to head outside with the wreath so he could hang it on his door but thought better of it.  instead, he hung it on the inside of his door.  If I put it outside he thought, I will hardly ever get to enjoy it.\n\nHe sat down, thinking hard.  Cat came and sat on his lap, purring loudly.  Gently, Norman scratched his cat's ears, the cat closed his eyes in pleasure.  \"Cat\", said Norman, \"tomorrow I am going to go get us a real Christmas tree, and some decorations for it.  You have never seen a Christmas tree but I think you will like it.  I should only buy unbreakable ornaments, so it won't matter if you climb the tree.\"  Norman was quiet for a time, then said to his cat, \"I am also going to get a couple of Christmas cards, I'm going to send one to my ex-wife, and also my son.  I wish I was closer to him.\"  Sadly Norman realized he had no idea what his son would enjoy getting for Christmas, but he had the bright idea to stick a $100 Amazon gift card in the envelope.  Feeling some better, Norman continued petting his cat until they both fell asleep in the chair.\n\n" }

He checked the description and discovered that its a compilation of songs. \n\n*\"Well, I dont have 30 minutes but I will listen to a few\" - he thought.*\n\n\nHe started listening to the music. The title and the picture of the statue was strange enough, but the music surprised him even more: it sounded like elevator music.\n\n\nHe didn't understand why would anybody listen to this kind of music and why it had quite a low quality, but he didn't want to be reluctant to change, so he continouned to listen.\n\n\nMinutes passed and Norman started daydreaming: He was with his dad in an elevator.\n\n*\"Busy man, always busy\" - he mumbled silenty.*\n\nHe could go to work with his dad because it was a Take Your Kid To Work Day.\n\nHe once looked at the tall building from outside and was astonished by how big it is - and now he will see it from inside!\n\n\nEven today he could clearly recall his feeling of excitement looking around in the complex, looking at the telephones, computers. It was a whole new world.\n\nThe greatest moment was when he looked outside behind the windows and saw the traffic. People and the cars looked tiny.\n\n*It made Norman smile. \"Good times, good times\" - he giggled.*\n\n\nHe remembered school, the classes, the other kids whom he used to hang out with, the pranks they did - and Lisa, the girl from his class that he secretly fancied but were always too shy to ask out.\n\n\nHe was a kid.

Since then the twin towers collapsed, smartphones were invented, Facebook launched, he found Norman, and a lot of things has happened. \n\n\nAs these events ran through his mind for a moment he wished he was young again. \n\nIt's not that he was not content with his life now - he had a good job, a comfortable house, a reliable car and Norman, but he felt something, an emotion he felt long ago...\n\n\nAs Norman was deep in his thoughts, the speakers of his computer beeped - he've got mail.

That morning he showed up to work with a pile of paperwork waiting to greet him, and Rich Tucker, his boss, was also having an unfortunate day, resulting in a few snaps and jabs at Norman. Norman sighed as he took down the paperwork one page at a time, eager for the lunch break.\n\nDuring the lunch break, Norman explored the possibilities of renting apartments in different cities. Chicago, Dallas, Springfield- all these places could be the answer to Norman's monotonous life. A change of scenery. His cat hated travelling, but perhaps it was necessary for Norman to feel good about where he was in life once again.\n\nAfter work, Norman felt exhausted, but it was the first warm day of the season, and he decided to go for a walk. He wasn't quite sure where he was heading towards- at first, it was to find a Burger King, but Norman passed by a road he's never walked down before. In the distance was a sunset, and to Norman, it almost seemed as if it was speaking to him.\n\nThe road went on and on, until it stopped being a road, and more of a trail. Soon Norman started to realize where he was- a nature trail, leading into a nearby valley. He knew the valley well- the public bus Norman took everyday to work crossed a bridge that hung over the valley. However, in the 10 years that Norman lived in the city, he never once stepped foot in it, until today.\n\nIn the ravine, Norman was enamored by the tall trees; the deer wandering through the woods, and the families having afternoon pic-nics. He bumped into one particular family that reminded him of his own; a man, a woman, and a small boy. It didn't help that the little boy looked just like Junior. As Norman passed by the family, he noticed they were trying to take a group photo.\n\n\"Would you like some help with that?\" Norman offered. They graciously accepted, and as if he were a ghost, Norman took a photo of the family, framing them along the river.\n\nNorman continued his journey through the woods, taking a moment to stand by the mostly dried riverbed. In front of him were a flock of geese, huddling near the pillars of the bridge. A beaver dived into the water and swam into its dam. What Norman found most relaxing of all, was the wind- a long and groaning whistle came from the trees, and like an aftershock, the grass whistled too. The sounds of the city were gone.\n\nAs Norman headed home, he took a walk across the bridge that he was solely used to being driven across. A bench sat in the center, looking out at the river. It was calm, like glass. Norman spat off the edge, waiting one, two, three, four seconds before it splatted below him. For a moment, Norman thought of jumping.\n\n Normally, the reasoning against it was always selfless- if he died, who would look after his cat? What would Junior think? What kind of child might find his body? It would scar the child for life, and it would be his fault.\n\nBut this was different for him. It wasn't the thought of others that stopped Norman from jumping, but it was the moment itself. Norman wasn't afraid of heights, and he knew that the only way he would fall off the bridge is if he jumped. But in this moment, Norman didn't want to jump. He was enjoying himself, he was happy, and everything seemed to be okay. He was having too good of a time to end it all early.\n\nNorman walked home, thinking about his day. The answer isn't that the city is boring, that it would all be fixed with a move to another city. The answer would be the same wherever he was- the little things; helping a family take a photo, skipping rocks on glass, the sound of the wind. He knew it wasn't the view that made him happy today; but his perspective.\n\nNorman went to sleep without watching CSI this day. On his bedside table, Norman put down a flower that he picked earlier on the trail. It smelled good, it reminded him of the adventure he had. He knew it would die eventually. He would have to go pluck another soon." }

In the morning they would say “Morning” to each other, and as they packed up their briefcases for the day, they would say “Evening”, even though both of them left the office at the same time, rode the elevator at the same time, and even wait at the bus stop at the same time.

Happy-birday,” Norman slurred unconvincingly. He wished that Frank had said that to him in an email instead. \n\t\n“Since it’s Friday, I’m looking for someone to get drunk with tonight. I don’t normally ask you, but all I know is I’m not getting home until it’s real late.

He hadn't seen his son in months--Norman was taking his studies seriously and was well on his way to pursuing his dream.  Norman seemed different--bouncy, happy, a tad giggly, and Norman caught the two out of the corner of his eye hugging warmly and then teasing each other.  This made Norman feel warm--intensely so--before a small pang of sadness.  He decided to let it slide.\n\nNorman had been planning this long weekend for two months now.  As soon as he'd heard that his son had a two week break and would split the time evenly with Norman, his mom, and her family, he couldn't contain himself.  He even found himself dropping small hints at work about a big movie night.  He had bought a waffle-maker two weeks ago.  When Norman was little, he always loved to sit on the counter and listen to his dad talk to him while making breakfast.  Now Norman got to share this again.\n\nThe movie Norman had chosen was light and airy, with no scary parts.  Halfway through, Anne, Norman's girlfriend had to take a call.  She left the theater. \n\n\"How polite,\" Norman thought, and nudged his son on the shoulder approvingly.\n\nMoments later Anne walked back into the room, her face shiny.  She leaned over to Norman and whispered something Norman couldn't hear. \n\nNorman was worried.  He stood them both up and walked them out of the theater.\n\nBoth were crying when he found them under the soft yellow light above them.\n\n\"Dad...Dad we have to go...Anne's father...\"\n\nNorman took over.  Norman called a cab, escorted them to the airport, bought snacks and stuffed them in their bags.  Norman waited with them and tried to find a way that they wouldn't need anything.\n\n\"They need each other now,\" thought Norman to himself, as his heart broke a little.\n\nAt 5AM, Norman and Anne hugged their last for the day.  Norman noticed that Anne squeezed tight.  \n\nNorman didn't know what to say, so he held her close and said \"Be safe and well, and I'm a phone call away.\" which made her sob harder.\n\nNorman felt bad for saying it.\n\nAt 630, Norman arrived home to a waffle-maker that hadn't been used.\n\nHe went to bed.\n" }

He was torn between his excitement to finish his fourth report of the day and his desire to keep his cat from getting hungry.  He decided to come in early to finish the report in the morning.  \n\nOn his drive home, the traffic light two blocks from his apartment turned yellow.  He quickly decided to slow down rather than risk speeding through and having the light change to red.  The car came to a stop that was a little more sudden than Norman was comfortable with.  Norman enjoyed the Eagles song on the radio while he waited for the light to change.  \n\nAs the elevator doors opened he saw a man who lived on his floor approaching the entrance to the apartment.  He decided to hold the elevator doors for him.  \"Thanks,\" said his neighbor.  \"No problem!\" Norman excitedly replied.  The man pressed the button with the number 4 on it after waiting for what seemed too long a time.  \n\nWhen the doors opened, there was a bit of confusion on who would get off the elevator first.  Norman, a little out of character, quickly and nervously exited.  His neighbor, not looking up from his phone, accidentally stepped on the back of Norman's shoe, causing it to come off.  \"My bad, dude\" said the man.  \"It's okay, it happens\" said Norman as he bent over to put it back on.  \n\nAs Norman knelt in the hallway to adjust his shoe, he heard the door to room 410 close from down the hall. \n\n\"I made a new friend today!\" Norman happily thought.

Not today.\n\nThe nervousness of seeing his best friend once again almost made Norman’s hands shake, but he knew that he couldn’t let that get the better of him.\n\nNorman drove a few hours until he came to the gates.

I can’t believe that it’s already been a year.” Norman’s best friend didn’t respond. \n\nFrom the small cylinder Norman drew forth a small American flag, which he unfurled and stuck into the soft soil of the carnation.\n\nPulling gently, Norman untied the bow around the book titled: “My Journal- May 25, 2015 to May 29, 2016”.\n\nStarting at the first page, Norman recounted the adventures of the past year to his best friend.\n\nIt took many hours to read the book, but he sat there, surrounded by many other best friends, maybe not his, but best friends nonetheless. All with their own American flag in front of them.\n\nThe sun was going down and Norman hadn’t eaten since breakfast.\n\nHe stood brushing off a few blades of grass and specks of dirt. \n\nWith a quiet, “Goodbye,” followed with a, “I’ll see you next year,” Norman left.

He got in and settled himself down on the window seat of a four-seater. There were a few other people in the carriage, all of them alone and looking at their phones, reading papers or listening to music. It was peaceful here.\n\nThe first leg of Norman's trip was quiet and beautiful. As soon as the train left the station, Norman's mind drifted off into nothingness, quietly taking in the green fields the train casually rode by. In his mind, Norman imagined a little man hopping along over obstacles like trees, rivers or sheds that were on the route. It was a game he had played in his head ever since he was a kid, though he had never told anyone about the silly imagination.\nThen Norman thought about what he'd say if someone asked where he was going. He always had a backstory prepared about visiting friends in a nearby city, just in case someone, like a conductor, would ask. Thankfully, that hadn't happened yet, so Norman went back to enjoying the beautiful view or the countryside.\n\nWhen Norman's train arrived at the first station, he noticed something strange. The platform was more crowded than usual. Way more crowded. Normally, there would hardly be any people here, that never had been, not on Sunday afternoons, but this time Norman saw even from the window that there were a lot of passengers here, making it seem almost like rush hour.\n\nWhen the train stopped, the massive crowd squirmed itself into the carriage. In no time, all seats were taken, and some people even had to keep standing. Norman's four-seater was full too, and he had to sit up straight not to touch knees with a rather annoyed looking man opposite him. Next to him there was a woman who had headphones on. Norman could hear the beats of her music.\n\nAs the train left the station, the conductor spoke over the intercom. \"Ladies and gentlemen, as you've noticed we're a little over our usual capacity. This is due to a reroute elsewhere, which made us pick up some more passengers. We apologize for the inconvenience.\"\n\nNorman tried to ignore the crowd and stared outside again, but he simply couldn't enjoy the landscapes anymore. His mind kept going to the man opposite him, wondering if he wasn't bothering him with his knees. He also kept glancing at a women who was standing up, and contemplated whether she was old enough that he should offer her his seat or that she might be offended because he'd think she was too old. He decided not to do it.\n\nThe next 20 minutes weren't much fun. Norman didn't enjoy his trip at all and decided to get out at the next station. When he'd squeezed  himself through the other passengers in the aisle, muttering \"excuse me\"s under his breath and gently elbowing his way around them to the doors, he found the platform deserted. He went to the little kiosk on the station and bought a large coffee to go, and sat down on one of the benches. \n\nHe patiently waited for the next train which would arrive in only 29 minutes. He didn't mind. He didn't have a particular destination anyway.\n" }

He was dangerously nearing 44 miles per hour, which was faster than the legal limit and not the kind of reckless behavior Norman would normally condone. But today Norman had coughed up a hairball just as Norman had been on his way out the door, and Norman had been so distracted by stopping to clean it up that he had left his mobile phone charger at home. It was a rotten day for Norman to forget the charger because he was awaiting a call from a woman he had met Friday night with whom he had been getting on famously.\n\nShe had told Norman she would call him today, and he felt just terrible about leaving the voicemail she must have left unanswered on his dead mobile phone. What must she be thinking of him? Would she want to talk to him at all anymore, or had he blown his chance with her? He imagined her giving up after trying his phone again and again; placing it out of sight so she wouldn't try to contact him again. Would she think Norman didn't like her? Or would she just assume he was very busy, after all? Would she refuse to talk to Norman if he called her back this evening? Norman hoped it wouldn't come to that. He would just have to call her as soon as he got in the door and plugged his phone in and explain the situation.\n\nWhen Norman finally pulled into his driveway, he hurriedly raced out of the car and trotted up his porch steps two at a time. Norman greeted him as he opened the front door but Norman was in too much of a hurry to stoop down and pet him.\n\nAt last, triumphantly, Norman plugged his charger into the wall and connected it to his mobile phone. He waited for all of the calls he had received that day to flood onto his screen. They didn't. Norman waited a moment longer, but still no missed calls appeared. She hadn't called that day, it seemed. That was okay, Norman thought. She must be very busy, after all." }

He glanced thoughtfully at his trusty alarm clock, and considered how faithfully it went off at 7am every single morning. \n\nNorman suddenly considered setting another alarm on the clock for 6:50am the next day. That way, he could trick himself and indulge in a 10 minute sleep-in, still arriving half an hour early for work the next day. \n\nThat night as Norman was climbing between his fresh, navy sheets, he had second thoughts about setting another alarm. For the past 20 years he had always only set one alarm, for the same time, on the same Philips Digital Alarm Clock he won custody of in the divorce. What if he didn't program it correctly, and neither alarm went off? Or he accidentally set it for 6:50pm INSTEAD of 6:50am? Norman shuddered at the possibility. \n\nAfter several seconds of internal debate, Norman decided to set the alarm for 6:55am instead. He would wake up 5 minutes earlier instead of sleeping in, spicing up his everyday routine responsibly.\n\nNorman smiled as he drifted off, thinking he would even have an extra 5 minutes in the morning to spend with Norman.

Just as he was contemplating taking another to see if that would change anything, it hit him.

Norman admired how neatly the stack looked with their perfectly aligned edges and pristine paper fronts. Norman quickly decided to add an additional $20 to this weeks allowance just so he can walk around with those perfect bills.\n\nHe excitedly handed over his paycheck with a sloppy signature on the rear and asked not-to-eagerly for $40 in cash. As she set two crisp $20 bills on the counter Norman quickly admired them before stuffing them into his wallet. As he left the build and walked to his car his mind raced on what to spend one of the $20 bills on. Content as usual Norman finally decided to splurge and purchase a bag of his favorite candies.\n\nSoon he had pulled up to a nearby gas station and began to peruse the candy selection. After selecting his candy and waiting his turn in line walked up to the cashier. 'Lexi' Her name tag read on her vest. She was deeply engrossed in a conversation with someone on the phone. Norman wondered for a moment who it was. Perhaps she had taken the time to call her father.\n\nNorman set his bag of candy on the counter and without an attempt from either party to make eye contact Lexi quickly scanned his candy as Norman pulled a fresh $20 from his wallet, smiling as he did so. \"2.19.\" Lexi managed to say in between sentences of her conversation on the phone. Norman proudly handed her the $20 and Lexi quickly grabbed it, pressed a few buttons on the register and tucked the bill into its void.\n\nShe tucked the phone between her ear on shoulder as she pulled a few bills out and rattled out some change. She held out a fist full of crumpled dollars and dirty change offering it to Norman. He reached out and grabbed the money and quickly counted how much was there. A paltry $2.81 was sitting in Normans shaking hands. He stared at the pile and looked back to the cashier with words starting to form at the back of his throat. He had just begun to mutter \"excuse m-\" when the nearby door bell clanged as a new customer walked in. Suddenly aware of the line that would soon form behind him he stuffed the money in his pocket and walked out to his car.\n\nIt wasn't until later when he was re-telling the tale to the pile of fluff that was Norman did he also realize he never grabbed his candy off the counter as he left.\n" }

After all he was not getting payed for going to the toilet.  \nSince Norman is aware of environmental issues, he doesn't use toilet paper after urinating, but instead shakes the last drops off.  \nBut this time, since Norman was worried about finishing up fast, he shook the last drop off too violently and it splashed against his beige trousers, leaving a visible wet stain of the size of a fingernail.  \nNorman was worried that anybody could see the wet stain on his trousers, should they see him leaving the restroom. And surely the'd know it was urine. So he went to the sink and splashed around in order to get several water stains all over his clothes. Now nobody would notice the wet stain on his trousers among all the obvious water stains above waist level.  \nHappy with his solution Norman left the mens room and shuffled back to his cubicle, comfortable that nobody would realize what really had happened to his trousers.  \nNorman started lunch break 2 minutes late, to compensate for his premature trip to the restroom.

{ "subreddit" : "lifeofnorman", "title" : "Norman Organizes his Bookshelf", "text" : "On Saturday evening, Norman decided to kill some time by organizing his bookshelf. He gently brushed the dust off of some of them and tried lining up the book titles by alphabetical order. Feeling quite productive, he came across his ex-wife’s old copy of Pride and Prejudice. \n\n\nWith trembling hands, he ran his thumb down the spine of the book and blew away the dust. “I’d forgotten about this,” he mumbled to himself.  Norman flipped open the pages to reveal a dried-up rose petal.\n\n\nThirty-something years ago, a fresh-faced Norman shifted his weight from foot to foot outside an apartment door, holding a single rose with his right hand. He took extra care with his hair gel and sported the new shirt he got last weekend. A part of him wondered how someone like him ever landed a date with a girl like Melinda. \n\nThe door opened suddenly, starting the rose out of Norman’s hand. Norman’s throat went dry. He silently cursed himself and muttered an apology before scrambling to pick up the fallen flower. As Norman was scrambling, his foot moved almost against his will, effectively crushing the rose.\n\n\nMelinda laughed good-naturedly. She picked up one petal that was still in good shape and headed back into the room, leaving Norman dazed in his own embarrassment. She pressed the petal between the pages of the book on her living room table, “Now I’ll always have something to remember tonight,” she looked back at Norman. Her eyes concaved upward into crescent moons. The hallway lights reflected in her eyes, making them twinkle a bit, and Norman secretly wished she’d smile like this to him forever.\n\n\nShe always knew what to do.\n\n\nNorman sat and stared at the petal. The memory brought a smile to his face. Which gradually faded as he got increasingly aware of his empty apartment. He balled his hands into fists, anticipating, longing for a sharp pain to attack his chest. Instead, he only felt a dull ache. Disappointed, he carefully tucked the petal back to its original place. After all, it was just a dried-up rose petal from years ago.\n\nNorman left the rest of the bookshelf undisturbed.

It was just so sudden. He lived a good life, he knew that. Not much had happened to Norman over the past decade, since he figured he would save all his energy for his fifties, and wait for time travel to be invented so he could go back and use his time more wisely. But he didn’t have a decade. If the doctor was correct, he only had two weeks.\n\nNorman packed his cat into his travelling cage, a spacious box with a blanket at the bottom and a treat in the back, and prepared for the long drive into the city. Norman tried to think of the last time he saw his son. He had a phone conversation with him a couple months ago, for Father's Day, but that five minute conversation didn’t give Norman too much insight into how his son’s life had been going. Norman was hoping that his son was doing financially well, so that, if needed, Norman the cat wouldn’t be such a burden if he were to move in.\n\nAfter a number of repetitive knocks on the door, it was finally answered by a young unknown woman.\n\n“Can I help you?” she asked Norman. Norman felt uncomfortable with the situation, being a strange man knocking on the door, holding a cat in his arms. He just about turned away solemnly, when Junior spotted him.\n\n“Dad? What are you doing here?” Junior came from the kitchen, holding a little kitten in his arms. Norman felt a pang of relief.\n\n“Oh! I’m just here for a visit, is all. It’s been quite awhile, Junior.”\n\nJunior cautiously invited his father into his apartment, and took a seat in his recliner.\n\n***\n\n“Looks like a new chair,” Norman commented.\n\n“Jess bought it for me.” Junior said, nodding towards the young woman making three cups of coffee.\n\n“What about the kitten?” asked Norman. He wondered if it’s name was Junior. \n\n“Ah, it was Jess’s idea. Her name is Annie.” Junior placed down Annie, letting the little cat scurry its way off the couch. Norman loosened his grip on Norman as well. \n\n“How’s your job?” asked Norman. \n\n“It’s good. I was just promoted to have a cubicle by myself, so that’s a nice change... Look, dad, is there a reason you stopped by? Not that I’m trying to shoo you out or anything..”\n\nNorman hesitated. He didn’t want to burden his son with the news about the tumor. But he didn’t know what else to say. In the corner of the room, a fight broke out between the cats. \n\nAnnie took a swipe at Norman as the larger cat cowered in the corner of the room. Norman sped from the couch, and so did Junior. \n\n“Bad Annie!” shouted Junior to Annie.\n\n“Don’t do that,” muttered Norman to Norman.\n\n“It’s time we put her in her cage.” said Junior. He hoisted Annie in his arms, took her near washing machines, and placed the cat in a moderately sized metal cage. \n\t\n“You shouldn’t put her in a cage like that, it’s uncomfortable.” said Norman. \n\n“She gets too rowdy at night, so we have to for now.”\n\nNorman’s heart started to race. “You still shouldn’t do that.”\n\n“Well, it’s my cat, so I’ll decide how I raise her.”\n\nNorman wanted to say something back, but couldn’t find the courage.\n\n“There’s a hair in my throat. I’m going to get going.” said Norman as he slipped on his shoes, grabbed his cat, and left the apartment. The cat started to purr as Norman went down the stairwell. Norman himself couldn’t stop shivering. *I’ll find you a home, the right home,* Norman thought to himself. *I’ll be sure of it.*\n \n" }

{ "subreddit" : "lifeofnorman", "title" : "Norman gets to work early", "text" : "Norman woke with a start. He looked at his clock, only to see he was 8 minutes late getting up to get ready for work. Did Norman somehow shut the alarm off without waking up? Did he forget to set it?\n\nWith no time to think, Norman sprang into action, heading to the bathroom without so much as putting on his slippers or robe. He brushed his teeth all too quickly to be as thorough as required, and briefly wondered what he would tell the dentist at his next appointment. Then Norman realized he was just standing in front of the mirror thinking too much panic set in again. He jumped in the shower without waiting for the water to turn warm. The cold water stung his skin, but he powered through the pain, his heart beating rapidly. Knowing that every precious minute he wasted he would be more and more likely to miss the bus, Norman decided against using conditioner but promised himself he would condition twice tomorrow! Norman's heart raced as he toweled off and when he put his shirt on he could tell the small of his back had not been thoroughly dried. Norman's internal voice shrieked in terror when he thought about the time that would be wasted changing to a dry shirt so instead he just threw on a coat to match his pants and headed for the door.\n\nIt was muggy out as Norman stepped onto the sidewalk and turned up the block toward the but stop. In moments Norman felt the summer heat and started sweating. He needed the coat to hide the wet spot on the back of his shirt, but now it was causing uncontrolled sweating and he just knew that the rest of his shirt would be soaked through soon enough. He struggled to get his coat off and saw the beginnings of dark marks around his arm pits. But the he was finally at the bus stop and he sat down to try and get control of his reeling mind.\n\nNorman looked at his watch to see that not only was he not late, he was actually 20 minutes early! He let out a sigh of relief and sat back on the bench, closing his eyes and breathing deep breaths. When he felt calm again, he perked up and looked around. The bus stop was rather empty. Norman had never considered that an earlier bus might help to miss the morning traffic, and made a mental note to try and get up early on Mondays just to have some time to himself on the way to work from now on- what a lucky discovery! The day that started out so ominously was starting to look up.\n\nThe bus came and Norman got on. Seeing that there were only a couple other riders and he could essentially pick whichever seat he wanted sent a thrill through Norman and confirmed to him that getting up early at least once a week was a grand idea. He stopped sweating as he took his seat near the front and the air inside the bus was cool enough that he figured his shirt would be dry by the time he got to work. Yes, things were definitely looking up!\n\nTwenty minutes later Norman got off and walked the block toward work feeling as though he was walking on clouds. When he reached for the door of the office, he was surprised to find that it was locked. Was he *too* early, perhaps? He looked about and then took a seat on the planter in front of the building to wait for someone to open the doors. A few minutes later and Norman spotted Harold, one of the security guards, coming around the corner.\n\n\"Good morning, Norman,\" said Harold amiabily.\n\n\"Good morning, Harold\" replied Norman. \"C-\" \n\nBefore Norman could ask Harold to open the door, he had a horrible realization: the missed alarm clock, the rush to get ready, the empty bus, they all came together to form a ball of nausea in the pit of Norman's stomach.\n\n\"What are you doing here on a Saturday, eh, trying to impress the boss?\" Harold asked with a grin and knowing wink.\n\nNorman mumbled out a response that must have been some sort of agreement with the notion, and Harold opened the door for him. Sitting at his cubicle, Norman stared off at nothing wondering how he could get himself out of this mess. If he left, Harold would know what a fool he was, but he wasn't authorized for overtime so he didn't dare do any work. If used his computer for non work-related reasons, he was sure he would be found out and let go, and he didn't even have a book to keep him company! Norman closed his eye and slowly lowered his head down until his forehead touched the edge of the desk. After 8 agonizing hours replaying his morning over and over and trying to spot how he could have realized his mistake before making it to the office, he finally headed out the door." }

He fidgeted a bit. Why hadn't they driven? There was free parking at the community center, but when he mentioned it at the apartment building Gladys' face went dark. \"Parking lots are the enemy\", she said with a flash in her eyes. Norman dared not vocalize any disagreement.\n\nThe more they walked, the more Norman learned about the neighborhood. He hadn't really explored the area since he moved into his apartment. It seemed to Norman that Gladys knew more about this stretch of town than anyone. Gladys seemingly knew everyone and waved to people as she told Norman stories. He struggled to keep up as Gladys' finger pointed out landmarks. \"When Arnold and I first moved here that building was a theatre called the Prosperity. Double features were a dime in those days.\" Norman would have never guessed that of the humble laundromat.\n\nThere was a corner market on Saturdays here back then. That house on the right was once owned by two Belgians and made truffles that Gladys described with more colorful language than Norman was used to hearing. When they reached a non-descript parking lot Gladys paused. \"This was once Amal's Dad's bakery. It was so good to see him again. I'm glad Faisal is doing well.\"\n\nBefore Norman had time to comment Gladys was already gone, chatting while beckoning Norman towards a place called the Caffe Valletta. \"Leo! Anna! Merħba! Meet my friend Norman!\" Norman hoped he sounded sincere while shaking hands and introducing himself. Norman declined an offer for espresso for fear of staying up too late.\n\nAs they carried on their way Norman thought about what Gladys said. \"Meet my friend\". He was her friend. That meant a lot to Norman. Even if he was a terrible partner against the wizards of Euchre he felt that Gladys would still care about him. Before he knew it they arrived. Some wrought-iron streetlamps had winked to life and Gladys was nose-deep in a flowerbed in front of the community center.\n\nNorman dimly understood why Gladys would rather walk." }

The cubicle became a rather quiet place- albeit it had always been a quiet place. Norman missed saying “Morning” and “Evening” to someone, and while Norman tried his best to make a friendship blossom with the secretary, Norman’s greetings were only met with a cold smile. Norman did not confront Frank about the shouting he heard that one night, or the night after that, or the one after that, before Frank left on vacation leave. In Norman’s defense, it was never as aggressive or violent as the first night; it was slow and dithering fighting, one that Norman supposed exhausted itself after some time.\n\nOne night, Norman came home and heard no shouting, no fighting. It was quiet. Norman was relieved that it came to an end on its own without him needing to get involved, but he was left wondering how it came to be. Did Josie leave? Did she take Amber with her? Or did they work it out? Or were they killed and hid in the closet? Were they hid in Norman’s closet? Norman checked his closet,  and learned nothing. He continued to speculate regularly as he rode to work on the public transit, to put in his hours in the small and empty cubicle. The smell of Vietnamese lunches started to dissipate, weeks passed, and Norman’s mind started to become occupied with irrelvant day-to-day problems once again.\n\nNorman walked home from the grocery store one evening, settling on having chicken breasts and rice for dinner. It was his favorite meal- he didn’t know why, it just was- and he was soon daydreaming about if he would rather bread the chicken or have it grilled. Norman waited for the dreadfully slow apartment elevator to arrive. *There are only three floors,* Norman grumbled to himself, as he shifted the plastic shopping bag from one hand to the other, trying to revive his curled fingers from feeling so numb.\n\nThe elevator doors opened to reveal Frank, his head hung down, buried into his phone. He would have walked past Norman completely if Norman hadn’t mumbled hello. \n\n“Hey Norman,” said Frank quietly. “How have you been?” \n\n“Good, good… How’s your vacation? Did you go anywhere?”\n\n“I thought about it. I have family in Maine I was thinking of visiting…”’ Frank stepped out of the elevator, shifting his way towards the front door of the apartment. “But I changed my mind. Just kicked it here for the time being.”\n\n“Well it’s always good to take a break,” said Norman. Frank nodded.\n\n“When will you be back at work?”\n\n“Not sure, Norman. At least another week. I was thinking I might quit.”\n\n“Oh really?” said Norman. “Yeah, maybe.” said Frank. Frank stepped towards the door. “Anyways, I have to run Norman. Good to see you.”\n\nFrank made his way towards the door, leaving behind Norman with an open mouth.\n\n“Frank,” Norman called out, before the door shut completely. Frank stuck his foot out. Norman hesitated for a moment, unsure if he was about to say something rude- if he wanted to say something rude- or if saying something rude was the only option he had.\n\n“Is everything okay, Frank?” Norman started to blush, feeling as if he’d overstepped a boundary.\n\nFrank shrugged. “No,” he said. He then started to laugh it off, passing it as depraved humor. Norman didn’t join in.\n\n“Well if you want… I have some extra chicken breasts for dinner. If you’d like to join me and my cat Norman tonight…”\n\n“Your cat’s name is Norman?” joked Frank. Norman nodded. “I never knew that.. I never thought to ask, I guess.”\n\nThe two of them laughed, and Frank transitioned to hold the door with his hand instead of his foot. “… Sure, Norman. Why not.” Norman nodded to Frank and Frank nodded, back, before Norman nodded one more time and made things uncomfortable. \n\n“See you, Norman.” Frank said. He stepped out the front door, and Norman called for the elevator one more time, with a warm smile on his face. \n\n\n***\n\nWell, that's all, folks. Thanks for reading and sticking through this uncomfortable series of stories about two dysfunctional men. \n" }

He sat in the first seat he noticed, which was a window seat close to the subway door. Within the first few minutes of his ride a large heavyset man sat beside Norman in the aisle seat.  Feeling crammed by the window, he was gladdened as the train quickly approached his final stop. As the Northbound train came to a halt, Norman politely informed the aisle seat occupant that he had reached his destination, and the man kindly allowed Norman to pass.

{ "subreddit" : "lifeofnorman", "title" : "Norman rips his pants", "text" : "Norman arrived home from work and hastened towards the door. He had stopped off at the store on the way home to purchase some cereal. Norman typically does his grocery shopping on a Sunday as to avoid this sort of rushed job, as he likes to peruse the fruit and vegetable section and see what new produce has been packed on the shelves. Last Sunday Norman had bought a mango. This particular day though, Norman had had a double serving of cereal for his breakfast as there was not enough left in the cereal box for another serving. \"What a lovely, unexpected treat\", Norman quirked at Norman, \"but this means I will have to make a quick dash to the store after work to refill\". \n\nTraffic was busier than usual on the way home. He had missed the peak traffic hour coming home from work thanks to his trip to the store, so he wondered why it was still just as busy. Norman peered at the digital clock on his radio dashboard, he made sure it was a quick glance, as to not hold up traffic in case there was a sudden burst of movement. '18:30' the clock read. 'CSI begins at 19:00', he thought to himself. Beads of sweat started to gather in his palms. He wiped his hands on his shirt quickly, before placing them both back on the steering wheel. The traffic started moving.\n\nAs Norman opened his front door and manoeuvred himself, his work bag and his shopping bag into the hallway, his belt loop became entangled on the doorknob. Norman had not noticed as he was too concerned with maintaining the integrity of the cereal box wedged in between himself and his work bag. It was too late anyway, the belt loop had snapped and released him. \n\n\"Oh fiddlebumps - what a nightmare\", Norman sighed. He had not thought to replace the sewing material his ex-wife had taken with her after she left, and now it had come back to bite him. \n\nAfter getting himself settled, he put on some long pyjama pants and turned on the television. It was the first segment of adverts during his CSI episode. He had already seen this one plenty of times so he did not mind missing the first 8 minutes. An advert popped up on screen advertising a new online clothing store. 'For the every day man, at an every day price', read the tagline. He decided to load up this website on his Dell laptop whilst waiting for CSI to return. He browsed the different categories until he found the section labelled 'Trousers'. There were some filters down the side to help him find something catered exactly for him. He chose the following filters, 'workwear', 'beige', 'neutral', 'N/A', 'medium'. It returned exactly 1 result. Realising his time was running out until CSI returned, he clicked on the trousers' thumbnail, quickly browsed through the model photos, before deciding that they were perfectly suitable, and at an 'every day price' too. He checked them out to his basket, input his debit card details and confirmed the purchase. Norman had received free next day delivery too as it was his first order. The CSI theme music played. Norman was happy.\n\n" }
{ "subreddit" : "lifeofnorman", "title" : "My own adaptation of a few Norman stories", "text" : "I combined a few Norman submissions to imagine a different, larger story than before.  Not what is traditionally posted here but I thought I'd share.  \n\n\nHalfway through his day at work, Norman yawned.\n\n\"Oh no, don't start doing that now!\" Lisa joked.  Norman almost chuckled. \n\n\"Yeah, I know.\"\n\n\"Had a rough night?\"\n\n\"You could say that,\" Norman lied. Lisa laughed again, and Norman let out a rare smile that she didn’t notice.  Norman didn't have a rough night. Norman had gotten eight hours of restful sleep. He was always a little tired.  Instead of driving a route he was just working in the post office for the day.  Norman was perched over the counter, welcoming any customer that stopped by.  Weekly the hours passed as Norman fitted packages and sold stamps.  Whenever the bell rang Norman was trained to meet the customer’s eyes first.  Presently, the open door framed an elderly man.  He was a balding, whiskered fellow wearing a pack of cigarettes in his front pocket, only carrying a weak smile.  The worn baseball cap struck Norman’s memory.  “Armstrong, Will.  3502 Northside Drive,” Norman thought.\n\n“Found any work yet Bill?” What was left of Bill’s smile disappeared as he looked down at the skinny 30 something year old.\n \n“I’ve been looking for 5 months now, I’d say,”  This took Norman off guard, making his words take their time on the way out.\n\n“S-sorry to hear that,”  Norman tried to sound disappointed yet hopeful for Bill’s sake.  “What’s kept you busy then?”\n\n“Walking mostly.”  Without another word Norman sold 3502 Northside Drive some stamps, searching hard for anything cheery he remembered from the last encounter he’d had with the smoky fellow. Norman couldn’t think of anything.\n\n“Well have a good one!”\n\n“Uh-huh,”  grunted the old man.  The door tripped the bell on his way out, ringing in the sad, still silence.  Norman hoped that everyone at the office sympathized with his best efforts but, every head was bent down and away, all pretending not to notice.  Regardless, Norman couldn’t shake the thought of Bill out walking aimlessly, feeling unwanted.\n\nAt 3pm, Norman and a few others, including Lisa, stopped for a short break.  Lisa was young. She seemed to be of college-age (although Norman could only guess). Norman himself wasn’t old yet, but he didn’t feel that way around Lisa.  She was new enough to the office to ask daily where to find things.  She stood out in the office most, at least to Norman. Suddenly sitting up in the break room, turning to him as if to ask a question.\n“So Norman what did you for the weekend? See your family with the time off?”  Norman was taken back.\n\t“Yes.” he said, eventually. “We had a great time.”  Norman lied.\n\t“Well what d’you do for fun around here?”\n\t“We… went to a baseball game”  Norman had always wanted to.\n  \t“How fun!”  Norman nodded, rubbing his cheek uncomfortably.  \n\nThe manager, Mike, took notice of Norman.  And like a good host, he always tried to help things go smoothly.  He tempted Norman to smile at a joke about the weather, but Norman didn’t move, thinking of Bill, stuck without work. \n\n Finally the day was nearing it’s end when the bell tolled one final time.   Norman recognized the guest right away.  An elderly woman; “Bridgers, Marilyn 710 West Walnut Street”.  710 West Walnut Street had short gray hair that curled in all directions.  Eyes that were once sharp squinted behind faded glasses on her wrinkled face.  She seemed tired, not from fatigue, but simply worn, like Norman felt.\n\n“How are you today?” Norman inquired.  He recalled a distant memory of 710 West Walnut Street loving to get those letters from her grandkids.  “Heard much from the grandkids lately?”\n\n“I’m sure they’re fine, but they haven’t written in a few years now.”  Norman could hardly speak when he heard this. Regret slowly started to gnaw at him for prying in with such a senseless question.\n\n  “I’ll just take some more stamps, thank you.”\n\n“I’m sorry ma’am.”   Norman pulled out the sheet of flowered paper. “Is that all I can help you with today?”\n\n“Just that would be lovely, thank you.”   She left him feeling cold.  Norman knew that cold, and wondered if she felt it too. Norman didn’t speak again until he got home. \n\n\n“I have to do something for her.”  Norman said to himself.  He paced through the living room, which was darkened by a thick black curtain that spread across the only front window.   “But she’s not going listen to a word I say!  Should I just send her cookies? Flowers?”  Norman asked all this to his friend, Leon, wondering if flowers would even be appropriate.  Norman had never given gifts like these before.  Leon watched intently as Norman set the short table for dinner.  Norman did so inaccurately, arguing aloud with himself while he trickled cheese onto the spaghetti.   “What do I even say to her?  She doesn’t care about me or know me at all,”  thought norman. The cooling spaghetti meant that dinner was over. Leaning back in his chair, Norman looked down. Leon was sleeping curled under the lamplight, the sight of which helped to calm him. Norman thought he shouldn’t worry either, since Leon wasn’t worried, even if Leon was a cat. \n\nThe next day was Tuesday, and Norman was walking as usual to his building. Norman saw Lisa walking across the parking lot.  He also noticed that their paces were the same and would reach the door at the same time. Norman slowed down. \nThrough the day, Norman was particularly distracted.  He managed to avoid Lisa by working through the breaks and looking down and away, trying to look focused on his dull work. Norman fought with himself all this time, deciding if he would reach out to to Mrs. Bridgers that evening.  When finally it was closing time, Norman had settled on writing her a card. He printed out something that could pass for a card on the office printer.  Standing up, he tucked his seat back under the desk.  Norman walked a little too quickly through the halls.  He passed Lisa’s concerned look on his way to the exit.\n\n“Norman?” Her voice rose a little higher than normal. He stopped and looked back over his shoulder, not letting go of the door’s handle. “Where are you rushing off to so quickly?” \n\n“I have to go.”  Norman didn’t wait to find out if Lisa had more to say, as Lisa’s response was lost in the slam of the door.\nNorman couldn’t get Lisa off his mind as he drove.  Having driven this route a countless number of times before, Norman had no trouble finding 710 West Walnut Street amongst the winding streets in the wooded neighborhoods.  Norman parked a few houses before Mrs. Bridger’s.  It gave Norman time. Norman wanted to turn back and go home, but against his own will Norman’s hand descended on the card.  It was gray, with a silver flower on the front that he didn’t know the name of.  He walked meekly up to the single story home.  Norman rang the doorbell.  The buzz summoned a voice from the house. The voice was faint but came quickly.  The door opening revealed an elderly women with hair that curled in all directions.  \n\n“Good evening! How’re you today!”\n\n“I’m fine.” \n\n“Aren’t you my mailman, Mr-”\n\n“Just call me Norman.”  Norman cut in, surprised at how his own confidence.\n\n“Norman! Well how can I help *you* today?”  \n \n“I just came to deliver some mail,”  Norman looked down at the modestly colored card, “from me. I know you haven’t seen any letters from your grandkids a time now.”\n\n“How nice of you to do!  But I wouldn’t count it against them,” She dismissed. “You can hardly blame them, they’re all grown now,”  she sighed.  It wasn’t a sad or even lonely sigh, but one with a hint of a smile.  A lump in Norman's throat started to tug as he stared.\n\n“You don’t, miss them then?”  \n\n“Well of course I miss them,” she laughed “but they have lives of their own now, and I’m glad for them.  And of course they’ll visit when they can.” Norman nodded, feeling a little stupid holding the door for so long. \n“Thank you very much for the card!”  \n\n“Well I’m happy for you and your family,” Norman said.  “I’d better get going, have a good night.”\n\nThe next day was Wednesday, and halfway through he yawned quietly to himself.  This gave him a thought.  Norman peered over her cubicle to look at Lisa. Her hair was curled today.  He stared at his hands pondering this sudden shift, wondering how he felt about the change.\nStanding to \"walk to the water cooler\",  he passed by, confirming that her hair was indeed different.  \nWhen he came back to the front counter with a cup of water, he stopped in front of her's and said, \n\n\"Hey, Lisa.\"  She turned around and said, \n\n\"Oh hey Norman, how're you?\"\n\n\"I'm well, thank you. I noticed your hair looks different today.\" he ventured\nLisa laughed, to Norman’s great alarm.\n\n\"Well actually, my hair is always this way naturally. I hate how curly it is, but I was too lazy to straighten it this morning. So it's normal today!\"\n\n“Oh” He thought for a moment. A part of Norman fought back, but a less vocal but more intimate voice in his head took control this time,  \"I like normal.\"\n\nNorman stepped through the office back to his desk, amazed by his sudden courageousness. He couldn’t wait to tell Leon about the curls when he returned home.\nLooking at herself in the monitor, Lisa smiled. \n\n\n\nedit:\n\nHere are the posts I used to imagine this story.

Saying a quick goodbye to Norman, he grabbed his lightest jacket, and headed out the door.\n \n\n&amp;nbsp; Norman went to tie the jacket around his waist, but suddenly stopped himself – it dawned on him that it might look a bit silly.

It perched itself on a branch, still once more, watching Norman.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp; What a thing this was to Norman! He felt quite sure that the squirrel, in its own way, knew what it was doing – like it was playing a sort of game. Norman chuckled to himself. \n\t\n\n&amp;nbsp; “*Squirrels playing games?*” He thought. “*What an idea!*”\n\t\n\n&amp;nbsp; The squirrel and Norman watched each other for a moment, until a distant noise broke the spell, and the squirrel ran further up the tree, out of sight.\n\t\n\n&amp;nbsp; Norman shook his head, smiling, and headed back to his house – that was enough excitement for one day.

{ "subreddit" : "lifeofnorman", "title" : "The Fourth of Norman", "text" : "There was a special place in Norman's heart for the Fourth of July. Every year, the office rented space at the city park to hold a picnic. It was quite the celebratory affair. Everyone in the building came out in their best casual clothing, laid out red-white-and-blue blankets and towels out on the grass, ate hotdogs, and played rousing games of volleyball out on the sand courts.\n\nNorman's part in the festivities was simple. He was to bring the potato salad. It was a simple job, but Norman took pride in his work, using an old family recipe which he'd first learned at the tender young age of thirteen. \"The secret,\" his mother had told him, \"is that each new generation adds an ingredient they think will go best with the current taste.\" His mother's sister, being the older of the two, had added a dash of lemon juice. Norman had deliberated for some time before settling on classic Dijon mustard. Norman's mother had taken one bite and declared it was the best potato salad she had ever eaten.\n\nThat Monday, Norman arose at 9 AM and went about his morning routine. Instead of putting on his work slacks and a dress shirt, however, Norman opted to wear jeans and a simple Hawaiian shirt decorated with pictures of tiny palm trees. He briefly debated whether or not he wanted to wear sandals or tennis shoes, then decided to compromise. *Socks and sandals it is,* he mused.\n\nNorman mewed happily as Norman entered the kitchen. \"Happy Fourth of July, Norman!\" Norman greeted his cat. He opened the fridge to check on the already-finished potato salad chilling in the crisper and retrieve some bread and jam for his breakfast. Then he went to the pantry to get a can of tuna to add to Norman's dish. He scooped the tuna out over Norman's regular kibble, and let Norman dig in.\n\nNorman left the house at 10 with the potato salad tucked safely in a patriotic-looking cooler, surrounded with several bags worth of ice. The radio played a big-band rendition of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" halfway through the trip. Norman tapped his fingers on the steering wheel the whole way through the song.\n\nLisa was in charge of the picnic food, as she was nearly every year. Once Norman arrived at the park, she directed him to the pavilion and had him set down the cooler on a picnic table.\n\n\"There it is,\" she said, lifting the Tupperware containers out of the cooler. \"Norman's World Famous Potato Salad!\"\n\nNorman blushed. \"I'm glad you like it.\"\n\n\"Norman, could you do me a huge favor? We don't have enough lemonade, and I need someone to buy some more. Could you do that?\" Norman accepted. It took him three tries, but he finally found a convenience store that wasn't closed and used his company card to buy five more gallons of lemonade. By the time he returned, it was time to eat.\n\nNorman spent the afternoon watching his coworkers play volleyball and fielding comments about the \"superior quality\" of his potato salad. He thanked them for the kind words, but politely declined to give anyone the recipe. Around three, Norman received a text message from his son:\n\n&gt; Hey dad, just wanted to say thanks for emailing me the potato salad recipe. My friends love it. I decided to add some bacon bits to the recipe though, I hope you don't mind. Maybe next year I'll come down and you can make it your way. Happy Fourth. TTYL\n\nBelow was a picture of Norman Jr. and his girlfriend on the beach.

A tanned man in  a cab pulled up in front of them.\n\n“Ola,” said Norman.\n\n“E hele pū\u02bboe me a\u02bbu.” said the taxi driver.\n\nNorman nodded to the man, then nodded to Claire. Claire nodded to the driver. \n\n“Hu!” shouted the driver. The two of them quickly entered the vehicle. He drove them much farther than they anticipated; no longer were they in the vicinity of the hotel, but now they were in a much more rugged part of town. It was rugged in a handsome way, and the driver pulled over in front of a restaurant with no signs. \n\n“Thank you!” Norman and Claire shouted. Norman didn’t see how much the fare was, and the driver didn’t say a price either. Norman put 20 dollars in his hand and stepped out on the street and into the restaurant. \n\nIt was a quaint and quiet place, with only a few tables occupied, and only a few tables cleaned off from the last customers. Norman and Claire took a seat, when momentarily later a large Hawaiian man approached the table. He carried two thin parchments of menu and placed it in front of them before solemnly returning to the kitchen. \n\n“Do you do things like this often, Norman?” asked Claire. Norman desperately wanted to say yes.\n\n“Not often at all, really.”\n\n“Me neither.” Claire admitted in a whisper. She smiled, and kicked Norman’s leg from under the table.\n\n***\n\n*To be continued*\n" }

Once the sun came up, the two stayed in bed a few hours longer, laying on their sides and watching the Hawaiian news broadcast. Eventually, after several failed attempts to get out of bed, by both sides, the two decided to head down to the hotel restaurant below.\n\n“Can you order for me?” asked Claire, “I’m just going to head to the lou.”\n\nNorman nodded and perused the menu. Sausage and eggs and toast sounded good, but he couldn’t for the life of him concentrate. He couldn’t get Claire off of his mind. Unfortunately for Norman, the waiter showed up before Norman could get his head straight. \n\n“What would you like?” asked the waiter.\n\n“Um, I’d like to get the scrambled eggs with sausage, rye bread on the side. Your darkest coffee. Make that two of all of that.”\n\nThe waiter nodded. It took a moment for Norman to realize his brevity. Usually, even when he just ordered for himself, his uncertainty left him a bumbling mess. His most common meal was *the special*, even though he never knew what the special would be, he knew he could at least say it without coming off like a numbskull. For once, Norman straightened his back as he sat at the table. He grew to regret that choice, as it made him have to yawn and aggressively stretch his back. His loose arm knocked Claire’s purse off the table. \n\nNorman’s reflexes were not fast enough to stop the purse from pouring all over the floor. Quickly, before she returned, Norman shoveled the innards back into the bag.\n\nThen he saw it.\n\nA wedding band; gold, and silver, and well worn. \n\nA moment later, he found a photograph, of a man, and a boy, and Claire.\n\nThe waiter came with the coffee.\n\nThe table next to Norman was celebrating a birthday, of a woman named Esther, turning 24. The man at the register struggled to find his wallet, and made small talk as he searched. An elderly couple bickered about the noise.\n\nClaire came out of the bathroom, looking for Norman, but his chair was empty.

As Norman told Norman about his day, the taste of Chinese food filled his mouth and he was content.\n\n\"Norman, there's a fortune cookie in here!\" Norman said excitedly. \"I wonder what my fortune is.\"\n\nNorman cracked open the fortune cookie, and read the slip of paper inside: \"Expect great changes in your life soon.\"\n\n\"Better not get too ambitious,\" Norman said flatly as he neatly folded the slip of paper in two and placed it gently in his wallet, behind his driver's license." }

The sentence sounded odd to him too. Norman never really thought about sex, at least, not in a very long time. When him and his wife divorced, over a decade ago, things were already quite rough. He tried to remember the last time he had sex with her, and he wasn’t sure. If he were to guess it would have been New Years 2002. To Norman, sex had become synonymous with his ex-wife; the only woman he had ever been with; the woman who left him for another man. Suffice to say that left him feeling rather disconnected from the world that so many desperately desired to be a part of. \n\nClaire was different. To Norman, it wasn’t the act that stood out. It was the everything after. She slept sparsely, keeping awake to run her fingers along Norman’s stomach, her head resting on his chest. Norman’s arm was going numb, keeping it draped around her shoulders. He liked that it was going numb; it meant that she was as close as she could be.\n\n“Your heart is racing,” Claire whispered. \n\n“Sorry.”\n\n“You don’t need to apologize so much, Norman. You have more confidence than what you liked to believe.”\n\n“Then I’m not sorry.”\n\nNorman felt her smile form on his chest. Norman ran his fingers down her back, gently rubbing her shoulders every now and then. He would squeeze her tight, and their middle aged bodies and bones crinkled and cracked so much they couldn’t help but laugh.\n\nNorman breathed in, and breathed out, and so did she, until the sun came up and their stomachs started to growl. \n\nFor once in Norman’s life, Norman forgot that hotel’s had free continental breakfast.

His most difficult exams were over. Carol from the mood study had suggested that Norm write out his thoughts about Norman in a letter. Norm had been ruminating about his Dad since he called about Convocation; maybe the letter would help calm him. He decided to stop trying for a minute and look for work online. While his Mom had already offered him a job at her firm, Norm wanted to see if he could strike out on his own.\n\nThe front door slammed open to the sound of hollering. Steve's back, thought Norm. Shit. Even though the thin door to his room was closed it would be seconds before that ape of a man turned on his massive stereo and burs-\n\n\"Hey, buddy! Time to get wasted!\" For Steve it was always time to get wasted. Norm for his part preferred to wait until the weekend before considering the idea. Or at the very least until nightfall. Norm wondered how Steve had kept his grades up. Probably the same way he kept everything up, a combination of deceit and perversion built on a foundation of unlimited wealth. Nobody knew where Steve's family had made their fortune.\n\nNorm's excuse about having to study scored a \"lame\" from Steve but once he agreed to go out for the evening Steve left him mercifully alone. Looking for work was a novelty of sorts for Norm. He had never needed to work; the only things on his resume for work experience were jobs that either his mother had created for him or internships that she had smooth-talked into existence for him.\n\nTossing his resume into the digital void for a few postings, Norm went back to the letter.\n\n\"Dear Dad:\n\nI am writing to you today to set an account of our relationship...\"\n\nNorm shuddered as he pressed the delete key. An unwashed plate rattled on his desk, moved by the thunderous bass of the beats pounding in the living room. If there was anything to look forward to with the end of school it was the end of having to live with Steve and his revolving door of meaningless friends.\n\n\"Dear Dad:\n\nI'm sorry that Randy broke your nose in the parking lot after the school play. I'm sorry...\"\n\nThat's not how letters should start, Norm thought. Why had his mind jumped immediately to that unhappy memory? But Carol had told him to write what came naturally to him. What did come to him was a confusing mess of sadness, frustration, and lamentation weakly buttressed by crumbling syntax. It wasn't any kind of letter Norm would ever let see the light of day. Well, at least he had a list of things to talk about with Carol. He ended the letter before he totally collapsed.\n\n\"...why did you never call?\"\n\nOutside, the sound of smashing glass and cheers.

I wonder if we ran out of brown paper towels.\" He thought to himself.

His sense of accomplishment was promptly interrupted by the sound of the doorbell. \"Who could this be?\" he thought to himself as he stood up. With an increasing sense of intrigue, he opened his front door to find nobody was there. With a furrowed brow, he closed the door and slid the doorchain back into position. \n\n\"That was strange, wasn't it?\" he said to Norman. Norman blinked back in agreement and curled back into his sleeping position.\n\nNo sooner had he returned to his chair and the doorbell rang again. He rose again, walked to the door, unslid the doorchain and opened the door. Nobody there. Norman took a step outside and looked around. The street seemed to be deserted. Across the street he noticed the neighbours' car. There were two young boys crouched behind it giggling to themselves. Norman smiled to himself and pretended not to see them. He went back inside and waited behind the door. As he waited, his smile became a chuckle as he rememered playing this game when he was a boy with his friend who lived two doors down. Norman wondered what old Richard was up to these days. He hadn't heard from his old friend since his father took a job in another city and they moved away. Norman hadn't thought about Richard for a long time. He was his best friend. \n\nNorman's nostaligia was interrupted by the sound of approaching footsteps and hushed childish giggling from the other side of the door. The doorbell rang and footsteps scampered away. Norman decided not to open the door straight away. That would spoil the game. Allowing an appropriate amount of time for the boys to resume their hiding place, Norman cleared his smile and opened the door. He stepped outside, still pretending not to see the boys behind the car across the street. He theatrically scratched his head in wonderment. He looked up and down the street, with his hand shiedling his eyes from the summer sun. As he scanned, he could see the boys trying to smother their laughter behind their hands. Norman found this strangly thrilling. He gave a dramatic shrug to himself and turned around, allowing a small smile to creep back to his lips. He could hear the boys laughing out loud as he closed the door behind him.\n\nWaiting behind the door again, Norman rememered how he used to make Norman Jr laugh when he was a young boy by acting the fool. Norman Jr laughed hardest when he did his pirate impression. \"Arr, it be time te be goin' te bed, matey. Ya harr\" he'd say, to Juniors squeals of delight. Norman chuckled to himself and wondered what Norman Jr was doing today. \n\nNorman decided that the next time the door bell rang, he would open the door quickly and shout \"YARRRR!!!\" like a pirate. He hoped it would make them laugh. He would have to make sure it was not too aggressive. He didn't really want to scare the boys. He waited with his hand on the door handle and listened closely, but he couldn't hear anything.\n\nAfter two or three minutes had passed, Norman returned to his chair. He scratched Norman behind the ear and smiled to himself, still lost in nostalgia. He reached for his phone, flipped it open, and with his index finger typed the message \"YA HARR MA8EY!\" and sent it to his son. He watched the message send and closed the phone.\n\nTwo hours later, Norman was watching CSI when his phone beeped. He opened it up and saw that it was a message from his son. It was a single question mark." }

He usually left the house in ten minutes, but he couldn’t make it. Norman decided to skip his morning shower and changed out of the pyjamas to the first shirt and trousers he found. He walked fast through his apartment, careful not to wake up Norman sleeping in the hallway. Norman quickly gulped down a glass of milk and made his way to the door. In all the rush, he had forgotten to check today’s weather forecast. He grabbed his jacket and umbrella and opened the door.\n\nAs he got out of the building, Norman noticed it was too hot to wear a jacket and the sky was clear of clouds.

Coming out of a red light, the vehicle started accelerating, while Norman watched it getting farther and farther from him. \n\nThe bus stop was 100 metres away, Norman hesitated; should he sprint to catch the bus or let it go? While considering his options, he started to walk-jog. But he was too slow, the bus was already leaving. Norman slowed down his pace and casually took out his phone. He stared at the black screen, making sure no one thought him to be out of place.\n\nTen minutes later, Norman got on the next bus. Covered in cold sweat, he sat down by his usual place next to the door. He checked the time again; 7:50. He’d make it on time to the office, but he wouldn’t have time to grab his morning coffee.

After spending ten seconds attempting to fix the problem himself, he decided to call the local plumber, Joshua.

Rather disappointed that Joshua didn't seem to remember him, Norman sat down at his kitchen table once again. After a minute of silence, Norman felt a bit intrusive, worrying that he might be bothering Joshua.\n\nInstead, he walked to his living room and sat down in the only armchair occupying the room. But the armchair was facing the entrance of the kitchen where Joshua was, forcing Norman to observe his work. Once again, Norman didn't want to bother Joshua and stood up.\n\nNorman walked to his bedroom. Even though he had slept in this morning, he thought that napping would be a great way to let time fly. When he entered the bedroom, he saw that Norman the cat had occupied his pillow. Norman the cat was sleeping and looked very peaceful. Norman didn't want to disturb him. Instead, he sat down on a chair next to his bed which he normally used to store laundry.\n\nNorman watched Norman's body gently bob up and down as he breathed.

The day went well- the best any first week could go when starting a new job. It was his first office job, after finishing an internship at a separate branch, Norman was promoted to an entry level accountant. After Junior had been born, Norman was nervous about how the bills would be paid with his wife on leave. The job was a tick on a list Norman was eager to check. What Norman had left on his list however, was his wife.\n\nThings weren’t going well. Bills were one thing the baby brought, but it also brought Norman and his then girlfriend of three months into a very difficult situation.\n\n“Maybe it’s for the best,” Norman said when they first learned the news. She nodded optimistically, sitting in the hospital waiting room. “Adoption is always an option too, you know.”\n\n“Norman…” she started, but didn’t finish. Norman took a deep breath, squeezing the palm of her hand. \n\nTwo years after that, the year was 2002, and Norman had just come home from work. Junior played in his baby bouncer as Norman’s wife prepared dinner, chicken breasts and rice. Norman wasn’t a fan of chicken, but he wasn’t one to complain to his wife. *She has enough on her plate as is,* Norman thought.\n\nDinner was served at the table as the three of them craned their heads towards the living room, absent-mindedly watching America’s Funniest Home Videos as it played on the television, still muted from before. A small dog ran into a plate glass window. Norman chuckled softly, and Junior, a fourteen month old baby, laughed so hard that he spewed up the chicken back onto the plate.\n\nNorman only managed a jerk forward motion to clean up before his wife took the lead. She took the plate out of Junior’s reach and tossed it into the kitchen sink, clanging violently with the dishes from the day before. She then went over to Junior, pulled his shirt off, and stomped over to the laundry room.\n\n“Need any help?” Norman muttered. No response.\n\nShe disappeared into the laundry room, shutting the door behind her. *What’s she doing in there?* Norman wondered. Norman continued to eat his dinner. Ten minutes later the episode of AFV had finished(the plate glass dog had won the ten grand), and Norman’s wife still hadn’t come out of the laundry room. Norman wondered if she was angry at him, if it was something he said. He didn’t see why that would be- he barely said anything at all this evening. Was it his socks? He did do a lot of walking about today, and perhaps the stench was getting to her.\n\nNorman walked quickly past the shut door and headed for the bedroom, finding a fresh pair of socks and put them on. He then sat down in his recliner, a wedding present from the in-laws. He picked up Junior and placed him on his knee, rhythmically bouncing the little boy as he flipped through the channels, looking for something different to watch. \n\n***\n\n[Click here for the final part.](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5v6xh4/months_later_norman_and_frank_part_99/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage)" }

Not that he believed in the divine or anything, but the daily eight hours he spent nested in his padded five-by-five cubicle was a gift of solace; a break from the spontaneity of the rest of his routine. \n\nHis cat, Norman, having wanted an extra quarter-serving of cat food after his evening meal, had stressed Norman out as he attempted to fall asleep the night before. The day's continuous, occupying task of filling out spreadsheets put him at ease, temporarily making him forget about how he'd need to re-allocate his household budget to accommodate Norman's growing appetite.\n\nUnfortunately for Norman, his routine was interrupted by a surprise visit from his neighbor in the opposite cubicle: Ricky. Ricky had been going through the labyrinth of cubicles, posting memos on each to convey a message from their project manager, Geoff. Upon reaching Norman for his last stop, he handed Norman a freshly printed leaflet. It read:\n\nCALL WITH SOUTHWEST DIVISION: 8/13 @ 2pm (SMALL CONFERENCE ROOM)\n\nHis heart skipped exactly one beat, breaking in a cold sweat to the realization that he'd completely forgotten about his mandatory participation in his team's upcoming conference call. Gathering about a half-dozen spreadsheets and their accompanying expense reports, Norman went home in a hurry to recite, again and again, what he would say the next day.\n\nThe next day went by more slowly than anyone previous; the hours before the call progressed about as slowly as Norman the Cat did through his larger portion the night before.

Thus, he mustered all the enthusiasm and energy he could, and headed into the small conference room to gather with his co-workers.\n\nTwenty minutes later, Norman, for a second, held a large grin on his face as he walked past the fleet of cubicles towards his own, though he promptly manipulated his cheeks as to display one that was more appropriately reserved. He had done it: he made the three consecutive statements he needed to express that there were, in fact, no anomalies to report in his expense sheets.\n\nFeeling giddy for his accomplishment, Norman decided to treat himself for an after-dinner dessert by purchasing a candy bar from the vending machine adjacent to his desk.

Each week, he put it off for one more week, reasoning with himself, until one day, he put his foot down, and said to the bathroom mirror “this is for Norman. He needs to be cared for as best as I can do.

He placed the laundry down on the ground, and took a quick look. The hot water heater was leaking a small amount of steam from the top of a small valve. The cause appeared to be a loose bolt, rattled back and forth. Being next to his red tool box, Norman withdrew a small wrench to tighten to the bolt.

He had elected to skip packing himself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and instead brought with him a five dollar bill with which to buy lunch from a food truck.\n\n.\n\nAs lunchtime came around, there were three trucks outside the building: one selling hot dogs, one selling tacos, and one selling ice cream. As he was looking over them, Norman chuckled to himself at the thought of ice cream for lunch. Norman walked towards the trucks, debating between hot dogs and tacos.\n\n.\n\n\"Hot dogs,\" he thought, \"are always a classic. Especially with ketchup and mustard.\" Suddenly Norman looked down and remembered that he was wearing a white shirt. The idea of a ketchup covered hot dog no longer appealed to him. \n\n.\n\nNorman approached the taco truck and looked at their menu. Tacos came by the pair, and, for $3.99 he could get chicken, pork, or chorizo tacos. For $4.99 he could get two different varieties of tacos as a combo. Norman thought that they could have worded their combo a little better. He also wished that they would have put a description of each taco on the board, as he had no idea what a \"chorizo\" was. Norman settled on a pair of chicken tacos and approached the man working the truck.\n\n.\n\n\"Hello,\" Norman said. \n\n\"Good afternoon,\" the truck worker replied.\n\n\"I would like the chicken tacos please\" Norman told the man.\n\nThe man nodded and disappeared into the truck. A short while later he reappeared with a pair of chicken tacos.\n\n\"That'll be $4,\" the man told Norman.\n\nNorman reached for his wallet and pulled out his $5 bill. He thought it odd that the man said $4, yet the menu advertised the tacos as $3.99. He handed the man the $5 bill. The man set the tacos on the counter and went to the register. The tacos smelled delicious, and the man soon returned with a receipt and a $1 bill.\n\n.\n\n\"Thanks, and enjoy the tacos!\" The man told Norman.\n\n.\n\n\"You too,\" Norman said automatically as he took his change, tacos, and receipt.\n\n.\n\nBut Norman was too occupied looking at his receipt to notice his gaff. The receipt listed the tacos as $3.99, the money received as $5, and the change given as $1.01-- yet Norman held only $1! Norman looked up to the man to ask about the penny, but it was too late; the man was already busy with another customer. Reluctantly, Norman took his taco and his shorted change back to his desk.

He held the spoon purposefully before himself, and studied the form of the spoon and the musculature of his hand. \n\n\"That hand is still a little shaky,\" Norman muttered. He often talked to himself. It was becoming a bad habit. \"I should quit this muttering nonsense.

A knife is definitely superior.\" \n\nThought experiment having arrived at a plausible conclusion, Norman proceeded with confidence the preparation of his midnight snack. \n\nNorman lifted the toast to eye level, and leaned in to smell its carbon aroma. The knife felt cool in his hand, and the butter rested precariously on its sleek edge.

The bread wasn't too fresh and the butter wasn't too salty. Everything was perfect. \n\nNorman spread butter to bread using a razor-like motion that he invented himself.

He had recently changed his diet to white meats and salads, along with fresh fruit.  While he didn't mind the new diet, he decided that he would treat himself to a small pint of ice cream and a candy bar over the weekend.  The new diet was in response to how sluggish he felt recently.  He couldn't pinpoint the cause of his frequent tiredness, and the doctor he went to had recommended he switch from his usual heartier meals to combat it.\n\nHe had two beers in the fridge at home and decided that, after he was sure his obligations were met for the evening, he would indulge himself with one.  He had made a mental checklist to ensure that he'd fed Norman, called Norman to ensure that he wouldn't be needing anything for the night (he didn't want to drive impaired), and ironed his clothes so he'd have a fresh start to the weekend.\n\nThe unease set in again, as Norman got into his car.

It had been a moment’s decision to buy them because they were not his usual brand but higher valued one on a sale.

He felt dreadful. “When do I learn?” he thought to himself. Norman gathered all his mental strength and stood up. The socks would have to go to the laundry bin.

Walking from the counter after thanking the acne-riddled teen, Norman thought about his old church and its massive pipe organ. It seemed omnipotent when Norman was a child, a gaping maw of unimaginable power that in theory transported its listeners to holy thoughts. Norman hadn’t gone in years but that deep timbre never stopped ringing in his soul.\n\nAs tricks and hands came and went Norman settled into routine. He had definitely made some bad plays here and there but the gentle teasing from the rest of the table didn’t sting like Norman thought it would. He learned more about his opponents and discovered that Burkes, like Norman’s father, had served in the war before quitting the Army. When Norman mentioned the commonality with his father Burkes asked if Norman’s father had said anything.\n\nHe hadn’t. In fact, Norman remembered his father to the table as a silent, sunken figure. He had never really gotten through to his father before he died. Before Norman sank into melancholy Gladys piped up about her father, an officer in the Navy who smoked a pipe and told fantastic tales of his time at sea. To have believed him Gladys’ father had fought the Kraken, repelled pirates, saved princes and princesses, delivered royal messages, and done all that before breakfast. They had a good laugh.\n\nAs they folded up their chairs Jonathon asked if Norman would be back next week. “But what about Gladys’ partner?” Norman was worried – he couldn’t supplant that person!\n\n“It’s okay, Norman.

David, Megan, and I have been talking, and we've decided to invite the entire office to go see the new movie, \"Hoard of the Dragon Queen\". We'll be going to the CineMovie location, on 19th street. The movie will be on the 25th of November, showtime at 7pm. Get there early to snag some good seats!\n\nNorman was, at first, disgruntled by the use of professional e-mail to organize such a casual event. However, he was a fan of the \"Dragon Queen\" comic series as a teenager, and was intrigued as to how it would look as a film. As Norman pondered this, it occured to him that he could save some money by signing up for a movie rewards card. He checked his watch. His finance report was finished, and lunch was in seven minutes. \"I have time,\" thought Norman.\n\nHe logged on to the CineMovie rewards website, and clicked the \"sign up button\". While the page was loading, he pulled out his phone and his wallet, and put them on his desk, in case he needed to get an app or give some debit card information.\n\nHe put in his name, his address, P.O. box, zip code. When it asked for a security question, he chose \"name of pet\" and entered \"Norman\". He smiled at the fact that Norman would be a part of his CineMovie account.\n\nWhen he was finished, he was asked whether he wanted to get the app or print out a temporary card before he could get a plastic one. To be on the safe side, he went for both. He installed the app and signed in on his phone. He then printed out the card, speed-walked to the printer, and speed-walked back. He then cut out the card and put it in his wallet.\n\nAs he logged out of the website and printed his report, it occurred to Norman that he had broken a rule by using the office computer for personal use.

His breakfast and morning commute were very satisfactory.  \n\nHe just had a bit of a feeling.  He pushed it aside, so as not to waste company time, and figured he'd ruminate on it over his lunch break.  He worked diligently and achieved a normal amount of productivity.  His coworkers were cordial with him, and he was back.  Judith, the new intern, cracked a joke he found quite amusing while taking his files.\n\nAs lunch approached, he considered his meal--leftover takeout from last night.  He had had an odd craving and, while certainly high in sodium, decided to treat himself to a half-portion so as to save the rest for the workday.  He had been walking recently and figured a tad bit of junk food was fine so long as he didn't overdo it.  \n\nLunch arrived and and Norman waited to use the microwave.  Judith was there, twiddling on her phone, waiting for her boyfriend to call back.  He told her that her joke was quite funny, and asked her what she was eating.  It was beef stew, apparently.\n\nNormally, Norman very much enjoyed hearing about others' lunch--he was quite a crock pot enthusiast, but today, it didn't seem to interest him, and he thought about how...off-kilter he felt.

His finances were in order--he had recently set nearly all of his bills to be on auto-pay, which was quite a relief and added about an hour to his week of just free time.  He felt healthy, he thought, no aches or fever.  His pets were clearly healthy.  \n\nWith no solution to his feeling of unease, Norman figured he might just be having an off day.

He seemed to be hoping that someone would offer him one. \n\nThe conductor arrived and Norman showed him his ticket. The conductor was broad, and he took his time. He swayed with the motion of the train. It made him seem tired, physically tired. \n\n\"I need to show you this,\" the passenger said, once Norman had passed the conductor's scrutiny. \n\nThe conductor took the large sheet of paper that the other man held out, and made a low sound. Norman saw that it was handwritten, and had been stamped and dated. Half a minute passed. \n\n\"I don't do this.\"\n\n\"Excuse me?\" asked the passenger.\n\n\"Your train was cancelled, fine. I put up with you being on this train without a ticket. But here\" - he indicated the last line of the note - \"whatever office gave you this asked me to *treat you nice*. I don't have to do that. You haven't bought a ticket.\"\n\nThe conductor had moved closer, and Norman couldn't see either of their faces now. A few seconds of silence passed as the man across the aisle seemed to struggle to assess the situation, to find the right response. Norman wanted to see, but he was grateful not to be seen, too.\n\n\"Well, I did have a ticket, on the other train. I spoke with the other conductor, right after getting on, I showed him - \"\n\n\"There are two conductors on this train!\" \n\nNorman was aware that he was no longer the only person in the carriage watching. The outburst had changed things, diverted gazes. \n\nHe himself had never been yelled at on a train, Norman thought. Once, coming in to land in Newark, late back to his seat, the flight attendant had used that firm voice that they seem they keep only for when it's needed: \"*Find* your *seat*, sir.\" He had never thought that voice would be used on him. His new hope was never to be in the same situation as the man across from him now. You're more anonymous on a plane, you can make it so no-one can catch your eye, he thought. \n\n\"Well I didn't know that at the time, did I?\" the passenger was saying now. \n\n\"I can't kick you off, but you don't have a ticket and let me tell you: I *don't* have to be nice to you. I don't know why they always write that.\"\n\nThe passenger relaxed. Norman could not. He was imagining being the centre of attention. \n\n\"Sir, I'm supposed to be on the way to Philadelphia. Instead I'm here, because of the cancellation. I've had to change all my plans, and I won't see my girlfriend til Monday. I have a ten page form to fill out to get a refund. I've already had my day ruined once, and you're angry over this note, which I didn't write. The other conductor - \"\n\n\"I DON'T HAVE TO BE NICE TO YOU!\"\n\nThe passenger thought of a short remark, but held it back, and instead only smiled, slightly. \n\nIn the silence, there seemed to be more light, like on a stage. The conductor looked around, saw the faces of his audience, lost his momentum, felt the sway again. He was muttering now, moving away. \n\nThe passenger changed seats, to face the other direction. Norman wondered how long it would be until he lifted his head from the form that he wasn't filling in. \n\nNorman took out his phone. Nothing from Norman Jr. \n\nHe checked his connecting train.

Norman became excited, because he thought he was early, and would now be able to be more productive than usual.\n\n   Norman went to his cubicle, but was astonished that the email with his work had not come in yet. Norman decided to wait for the email to come in, because he didn't want to bother his boss. He sat for a minute before he started growing impatient. He started lightly tapping his foot, to give himself the illusion of progress.\n\n   \"What is the point of coming to work early, if there is nothing to do?\" Norman thought to himself.\n\n   Norman then realized that his tapping foot became too loud, and would disturb his fellow employees. So, he decided to do what he considered the lesser of two evils, and go to his boss's office and ask for work.\n\n   Norman found it quite peculiar that his boss was not there, and for that matter no one else seemed to be in the office. Norman decided to look around to see if he could find anyone who can explain the situation to him.\n\n   After searching through the office, and finding many new wonders that he never saw, he found a custodial manager mopping the floor.\n\n   \"Why is no one here?\"\n\n   \"Norman, don't you know? It's Sunday.\"\n\n   Norman realized what happened, and felt ridiculous for making such a simple mistake. Norman was now left with a hard choice, go home, without doing anything and come back tomorrow, or stay at the office over night. This was a hard decision for Norman, because he only uses his car to travel to and from work. However, Norman did not do any work today, so he could not justify the harm his car does to the environment. Norman also knew that his house was too far to walk. So, Norman decided to sit at his computer and wait until he was given some work.\n\n   Norman woke up the next morning to the sound of his email's inbox getting a new piece of mail.\n\n   \"Time to work.\" Norman said excitedly as he proceeded to read the email, followed by going about his business." }

Norman was the first to notice the light and the most immediately interested in it, plotting his path to the warm light on the sill as his tail flicked slowly. Norman, meanwhile, was tucked into his quilt, chest rising and falling with some truly impressive snores. \n\n\"Ooph!\" Norman's flightpath to the windowsill included using Norman to reach the dresser, from there making the last leap. The plan was kiboshed by Norman's exclamation. \"Oh, alright Norman. Let's get you some crunchies.\" Early morning routine kicked in as Norman rose from bed; slippers, glasses, dodging the cat while filling up Norman's food and water bowl, getting coffee ready, and walking to the lobby to grab his newspaper. To that end he made it to the front door, where Norman found a small envelope tucked under his door.\n\nHe opened it:\n\n--\n\nDear Norman,\n\nThank you ever so much for joining me last night at Wembly Hall. You are a valiant partner. That and I always enjoy introducing people. You never know how valuable a chance encounter may be! Speaking of, I am going out to visit an old friend next Friday and I won't be home in time to join you for Euchre. If you need a hand finding someone to play with for next week just let me know; I've got some pretty exciting people in my phonebook. Sorry about the trouble.\n\nYour Friend,\nGladys\n\nPS: Wiltshire says hello\n\n--\n\nBefore Norman could bring himself to question what \"exciting people\" meant, he felt a tingle of excitement. The morning paper was forgotten as Norman put an album on and settled into his recliner in the library to think. Who could he ask to play with him? In some distant corner of his mind Norman thought of Norman Jr., sitting across from him with a handful of cards as steam rises from a Styrofoam cup. Now that would be exciting.\n\nBack to reality, Norman thought to himself. Maybe the intern would want to come along? The intern, a quiet fellow who had just graduated from a prestigious university in his home country had once mentioned that he felt lonely. Yes, Norman thought to himself. He might appreciate an invitation. But would be know how to play? One way to find out.\n\nIt would be another ninteen minutes before the record finished and Norman, now sipping a weak cup of coffee, realized that he was still without his Sunday paper. Norman took the lift to the lobby and walked to the mail table. As he tucked the paper under his arm Gladys came into the building, fingers covered in dirt.\n\n\"Good morning, Gladys! I got your note - don't worry about a thing. I'll ask the office intern if he wants to play\". Norman hoped he didn't sound too eager that she was leaving. \"Have fun with your old friend!\"\n\nGladys smiled. Was that a pang of sadness Norman saw in Gladys' eye?\n\n\n" }

He had contributed to a conversation in the office that day with some witty puns, which made some of his coworkers chuckle.  He usually kept to himself, so the experience made him feel confident &amp; adventurous, which prompted him to do something he'd never attempted before: eat a pizza from the outside in.  He would start at the crust, and work his way to the tip of the pizza slice.  He was concerned it would make a mess, so he had prepared a few napkins just in case.  Once the pizza was ready, and he had slipped a slice to Norman (because he had forgotten to feed him in all the excitement) he thumped onto the couch and carefully fed the pizza, crust first, into his mouth.  He got some sauce on his fingers from trying to hold the tip up, but that was okay, he had already prepared for that.  He felt a mildly calming sense of satisfaction wash over him as he ate the last bite, which also had a large pepperoni on it.  He ate the rest of the slices normally, because he had already used up the two napkins he brought to the couch.  He saved the leftovers for his lunch the next day, because the people in the office give him odd looks at lunch break sometimes when he eats his oatmeal out of a tupperware container.

Norman had been excited for this pleasant change in weather ever since Tuesday, when he saw a weather forecast on the front page of a newspaper while paying for his groceries. \"Friday, Clear skies with a high of 76.\"\n\nThis morning, the weather was pleasant enough for Norman to drive to work with his windows partially rolled down. He enjoyed the fresh air so much that he even considered going for a walk through the park after feeding Norman.\n\nOn his drive way home, Norman saw more people walking on the sidewalks than usual.

Just in case there was enough snow from the night before to slow down his commute by 10 minutes.\n\nOn his way to work there was no snow on the roads.

He could not remember the last time he came to work this early. But, this smile quickly melted away. Just past space 31 was supposed to be his space, but what Norman saw instead was a monument of white. It looked as if every inch of snow from the night before, from across the entire parking lot, had all been shoved onto Norman’s parking space.\n\nHe was shellshocked. He felt betrayed by those that were supposed to help him. Why would those piloting the snow plows do this to him? What had he done? Norman’s car idled, it was now 8:52.

Earlier that morning, Norman turned on his phone for the first time in a week, to no surprise that no notifications were left behind. *As if nothing ever happened,* Norman thought. \n\n\nNorman ordered a maple flavored iced cappuccino and a sausage-and-egg muffin from a drive thru, and came to his office early, per usual. \n\n\nA stack of papers from the half week of work he missed waited on his desk, and Norman got to work.\n\nNorman thought about the haggard Hawaiian restaurant where Claire played footsie’s with him. It led to thinking about the hotel, and their night together. Norman squeezed his eyes shut, until the stars appeared. He forced himself to think about what he would be having for dinner. It didn’t matter what it was, so long as it overcame his thoughts. *I’ll be having chicken for dinner,* Norman stated, *with Sprite.* \n\n\nHe loved his wife dearly. Her affair took Norman by surprise, and after all was said and done, he couldn’t help but…\n\n*Stop,* Norman thought. He tried to remember which episodes of CSI were recorded over the week. He focused on his pencil, thinking about why HB2 could be so successful, to the point of pushing HB1 to extinction. One of the scavenger hunt items was a pencil, delivered to a historical-\n\nNorman snapped his pencil. Norman thought about if he were a different sort of man, that perhaps it would have been okay to stay with Claire. The husband would never find out, and perhaps she already had a plan to sleep with a stranger on the vacation, and if Norman didn’t do it, someone else would have. He didn’t want to think of Claire to be that sort of person. Norman could never be that man, not after spending so many years of being the man on the opposite side. He couldn’t wish this life on anyone, even if they would never affect his own life.\n\n\nNorman counted the tabs he had open on his computer, counting down until none were left, and then counting back up, until he surpassed the original number. He counted the change in his pocket, deciding if it was enough for both the parking fare and a bag of chips later tonight. He felt a sharper object in his pocket.\n\n\nNorman pulled a small turtle figurine out of his pocket, with the word *Waikiki* engraved on its belly. *I must have forgotten it from the scavenger hunt,* Norman thought.\n\n\n Back in his apartment is a shoe-box, filled with trinkets and memories, stretching all the way back to when he was a small boy. Good memories, some sad, but all things he’s cherished, and never wanted to forget. A baseball card. A hair-clip, a comb, a rusted coin. A wedding ring, some flattened flowers; drawings from his son.\n\n\nThe turtle would wait on the edge of his desk, near enough so that it would only take a flick or a misplaced glass of water to cause it to fall down into the wastebasket. It was a decision he would have to make someday. \n\n*Someday,* Norman thought. \n\n\nNorman went back to work.\n\n\n***\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bmCmb7TCso\n\nOnly took me a bloody year to finish writing this story.

The head of the whole operation is trying to force them together to work for the good of the planet. One is ultimately useless without the other. \n\nChapter three ends on a cliffhanger. Norman can't sleep on it, he must read the fourth chapter. As one could probably guess by this point, Norman fell into the spell of a good book. Norman sat at the foot of the bed, waffling his tail and trying to stay awake as long as Norman was, but giving up when his eyes became heavier than thoughts. \n\nWith a warm cat to curl up with Norman was led on a journey through space and time. The federal government was the main antagonist, or really, the Secretary of Defense was. The astronauts band together and go to fight human-alien hybrids on a distant planet just now discovered. But to beat their common enemy, the defense secretary, the aliens must team up with the very astronauts they had previously despised. With a climactic scene taking place on the bridge of a nose protruding from an intergalactic Mount Rushmore, Norman flipped the last page and closed the book with finality. It was now 3:00am and he put a saucer of milk out should Norman wake ahead of him. \n\nAs Norman repositioned himself in bed, he appreciated the fact that as an adult he could choose to stay up all night should he find himself in an engaging book, and there was nobody to stop him. It was one of the first times Norman, already halfway through his life, grasped the meaning of the true autonomy of adulthood. \"And they say never buy books at the airport!\" Norman said, switching his light off and digging in his heels, anticipating another good book and another good day, several dreams from now.

He decided to head to the restroom. \n\nHe felt embarrassed as his co-workers watched him head to the bathroom AGAIN after his routine usage everyday, 5 minutes before lunch. \"I better make this quick or they'll think I'm taking it easy at work\" he told himself as he turned slightly red. When he got to the bathroom he checked his pockets for his TUMS, which helps his stomach aches. He searched and searched but to no avail he'd forgotten them at home!\n\nHe was very uncomfortable but didn't want to have to inconvenience anyone. All of the sudden his co-worker Patrick entered the bathroom. He nervously said \"Good afternoon Patrick\". Patrick gave a side eyed smile and nod and said, \"hey Norman\". Norman felt gasses bloating in his stomach and was getting very uncomfortable. He knew the person next to Patrick had Pepto Bismol, which he's never tried but in times of danger he knew he had to be adventurous. Norman was sweating thinking of how to nicely ask Patrick for his co-worker's Pepto Bismol. Before he could finally open his mouth, Patrick's Co-worker burst into the bathroom with a massive stomach ache and Pepto Bismol in hand. \"OH boy this ones not gunna be good!!\" The co-worker said as he ran to the first stall in sight. \n\nGastric sounds that sounded similar to Norman's favorite sci-fi show \"robot alien\" started to come from the stall. Norman giggled to himself but tried not to be audible. Patrick who was obviously concerned tried to talk to his co-worker through the stall. \"You alright in there Derrick?\" Patrick asked. Norman used this opportunity to sit in the empty stall next to Derrick. \n\nNorman could partially see under his stall. Derrick's feet were pointing outward with pain and strain. But there it was on the floor, Pepto Bismol the solution to his problem. How would he reach it? If he grabbed it Derrick would see and likely be upset.\n\nNorman decided it was time to stop playing around and get serious...but he couldn't grab it. He walked out of the bathroom and headed towards Derrick's  desk with intentions of taking a small sip of his Pepto Bismol. As he got closer he looked over to\nhis desk and noticed his files were untidy. \"Let me fix this before I go over there.\" He felt somewhat confident but needed to prioritize work. But as he got to his desk he noticed that his TUMS were hidden under the clutter. He'd forgotten it on his desk.\n\nHe felt relieved and his stomach actually didn't hurt anymore. As he drove home from work that night he wondered if he should get Derrick a get well card. He wondered about it the whole car ride but realized his show was starting at 9pm and he had to feed his cats. \"Maybe next time\" he said happily to himself as he pulled into his driveway." }

I said that I would gage the interest of my fellow filmmakers here where I live, to see if they would be want to work together on a project like this. I don't think they know Norman like I do, but the whole established audience thing, the 57,000 of you, makes it an easy sell to outsiders.\n\nI wrote out a few scripts and sent it around, and they all like it- but it's too short. I'll post it here, and you guys can give me some feedback as well on the stories chosen for the script. \n\nAnyways, the too short thing- the Rode Reel contest requires it to be between 1-3 minutes. I wrote a script that fits there, but at the same time, it's wasted potential to make it that short. The other problem comes from the fact that screenwriting is a terribly different monster than just prose. If you write something in, you *have* to figure out how it can be filmed, and filmed for the cheap.\n\nSo here's my proposal so far: I'm going to write a 5-10 minute short, and after the script is locked, I'll do the storyboarding and budget planning. Once I've figured out the bare minimum for the project, I'll start a kickstarter, and if we can hit the goal, we'll make the short. \n\nThat's a stretch, I know, who knows how many people will actually care to donate. I'm guessing now, with a project of this size, the minimum would be around 4,000 dollars. I've thought about stretch goals, and I've started to make moves towards some of them, and all I can say now is that if they work out, it'll be super, super cool. \n\nHere's the first draft of the script. I think it's impossible to capture every aspect of Norman, so I just focused on a few.\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/12o1w378hvzvyxm/Norman%20Short%20Film.pdf?dl=0\n\n\n\nThat's my pitch for now.

After that, there's not a whole lot left to do, and I can see me getting the final draft done in May. Then after that, I'll just be waiting for a review copy for myself.\n" }

Norman would just have to knock, that’s all, and perhaps it wouldn’t solve anything, but at least it would stop the fighting. A simple knock on the door. He did it all the time. He wasn’t tired, wasn’t lazy, and he had no physical excuse in the world not to just do it. What if the knock wasn’t heard? What if they were so heavily in the throws of their fight that, no matter how hard he knocked, it wouldn’t be noticed? Norman had no excuse, none but the ones he gave himself, the moments of hesitation forming to something tangible. No one would hold Norman accountable if he didn’t say anything. He could still be at the Chinese restaurant, for all anyone cared. If  someone else came through the hallway, perhaps they could knock together. Anyone at all, *somebody else*.

Norman pinched open the package and pulled out the paper.\n\n**“Two days from now, tomorrow will be yesterday.”** \n\n*Two days from now will be Friday*, Norman tried to joke with himself.

Angela just jotted down his order and was off again in a heartbeat.\n\n\nNorman sat there, contemplating everything that is wrong with the world. Today’s youth, Norman thought, have no manners. Can’t remember faces because their heads are always down looking at a screen. No one has basic manners anymore. Common courtesy was less and less common with every new generation, etc. etc. Norman was lost in thought about the woes of the world today when his food arrived. He hadn’t noticed a lot of time passing, but his food was luke warm by the time Angela set it on the table, topped off his water, and asked if he needed anything else. Norman just mumbled that he was fine and picked up his knife to spread butter and jam on his toast. Norman thought that the food would have been wonderful if it had arrived on time and hadn’t gotten cold by the time he was just half way through it. That was the last straw. Norman made his mind up to complain to the manager on the way out. Regulars weren’t supposed to have such bad experiences! They should be respected, remembered, and valued!\n\n\nWhen Norman was done with his meal and received his check, he marched toward the cashier at the front, mentally reviewing everything that had upset him. He paid his bill then asked to see a manager. A tired, grumpy looking gentleman came up front. “Yes?” asked the man, with a bit of a bark to his voice.  Norman thought the man was pretty rude for not introducing himself or shaking his hand. “Um, about the food…” Norman began. “Yeah, what about it?” The man barked again, cutting Norman off. Norman took note of the man’s hard stare and after a few moments Norman lost his nerve. “Uh, the food was great.” Norman finally spit out, “And so was the service.” Norman added hastily. He turned and walked quickly away before the man could yell at him. His heart was racing and he was sure he heard the man mumble something about wasting his time right before the door closed. Norman headed back home, breathing hard and realized when he got to his door that he left his keys on the table at the cafe. He decided to go to the park, and maybe check back at the restaurant for his keys after shift change." }

Come on, man, *think*!\n\nThe dream… yes, the dream was split into two halves.  The first half was orange, green, blue… a log across a stream, acting as a bridge.  Bright, sunny walls… rock faces, like a canyon.  There was a person there.  No, not a person.  More like, like a thing that *imitated* people.

They bumped into each other in the busy hallway of a ski-lodge, which was lined with metal lockers, each about the size of a shoebox and painted grey.

Norman would surely miss March's tiger striped cat, but April deserved a turn. \"Maybe it'll be a fluffy white cat.\" He mused. \"Or a black one\" Norman quite enjoyed guessing.

Norman reflected on his activities through the day.  He had arrived at work a few minutes early, just enough to avoid the traffic his later colleagues always complained about, but not by enough to avoid driving past a few stopped cars that had apparently collided.  Even now, as he prepared to leave the office, Norman felt a twinge of guilt that he hadn't stopped to help.  *They were standing around and inspecting the damage,* he told himself again, *and it didn't look severe at all.*  He didn't want to be late for work, or worse, contribute to another accident by behaving unpredictably on the road.\n\nHe adjusted his tie, wishing his manager had told him that it would be unnecessary.

He doubted Jesse would be as helpful.  (But, he had to admit, Jesse would be more effective than a vacant position.)\n\nThe rest of Norman's morning had been spent sorting emails.  One of those networking sites had sent him quite a few messages about openings at nearby offices.  He wondered if it was true that he could get a pay increase by switching companies... But his benefits were very good, and last year the company bought him a new, more ergonomic chair.  It was quite comfortable, once he'd broken it in a bit.  He deleted the notifications.\n\nAt lunch, Norman had planned to meet Lisa at the diner across the street, but when he arrived, he found a text from earlier in the day saying that her boyfriend had made last-minute plans, so she couldn't make it.  His usually-social lunch was much quieter and much quicker than usual, so he popped over to the shops for a few minutes.  It was nice, he decided, to stretch his legs a bit during the lunch break.  Perhaps he would join one of those office walking groups.  He was going to pass the pet shop when he remembered that his cat hadn't received a Valentine's present.

He was about to give up when he spotted the perfect choice.  He chuckled to himself at his joke, and took his items to the checkout.\n\nThe afternoon was uneventful.  Many of his coworkers left early, leaving Norman and only a few others in the large space.  Norman liked his coworkers, but he enjoyed the solitude as well.  He felt very efficient in the quieter office, and wished that he had just a little more work to do.\n\nDuring his downtime, he checked on the delivery status for the flowers he'd bought.  The online tracker reported that they were delivered to a person at his ex-wife's house.  He smiled, hoping she was the one who had received them.  She had chastised him for buying her flowers the first few times he did it, but either she had decided to enjoy them as he intended, or to ignore them.  He preferred to imagine the former, especially since he started signing them Norman Jr.  He knew Junior didn't have the spending money, but Norman felt like it was a nice gesture that his son would make, given the opportunity.\n\nNow, after writing down a brief account of his daily activities, Norman was finally ready to leave the office.  He removed his tie the moment he got outside, and drove home with it piled in the passenger seat, next to the bag from the pet shop.  He was relieved to see both vehicles from that morning were gone.\n\nWhen he got home, he went inside before remembering his tie and Norman's new toy, and had to run back out to his car for them.  \"Norman!\" he called.  \"I've got a present for you!\"  Norman lifted his head and sniffed, uncertain what his human's excitement was about.\n\nNorman brought the bag over to his cat, and pulled out two items.  \"Now we can end the day together, buddy!\"  He scratched the cat's head, and then put the new collar--a bow-tie collar!--around Norman's neck.  \"I took mine off early, but I won't make you wear this one very long,\" Norman commented with a smile.  \"And here's your drink!\"  He presented a stuffed wine bottle to Norman, who rubbed his cheek on it before allowing his human to place it next to him on the couch.\n\nNorman went to the fridge and got his leftovers ready for dinner, then grabbed a beer and went to sit on the couch with the cat.  He turned on the TV, and looked over at his feline buddy.  Norman was curled up with the wine bottle.  Norman decided that this was a very good day." }

He had rocked a comb over for 10 years and wasn't about to let his co-workers know he's balding. 30 mins til work he leaves. \"Bye Norman.\"\n\n15 mins early Norman is really happy. He can sit in his car and listen to his podcast. Trumpcast was of particular interest today. Not a political person Norman wanted to be informed on the candidate who he would be voting for this year. Raised a Republican he wasn't about to change his ways now. The guilt of  being wrong for so many years could only worsen his depression. He still worried about having voted for the decriminalization of marijuana, that was done for Junior. Strayed away from his conservative intuition for the hope for a better future. Maybe Junior should have a bigger say anyways it is his future...\n\nAnyways his boss finally showed up 5 mins before work. Norman hopped out his car, greeted his boss with a \"Good morning.\" and a terse handshake. His boss nods; usually talkative, but he can't seem to remember Norman's name. They enter; now Norman is relaxed. Some of his co-workers would joke that it's a cube prison. Norman enjoyed the seclusion and safety. Today Stan wasn't there. He managed to visit the water cooler when no one was there. He left 5 mins before 5 Pm avoiding the parking lot traffic.\n\nNorman was happy today went so smoothly." }

(Lefty and Clarissa. Derrik flattered himself 'quaint.')\n\nEver since he took his bus seat, Norman abstractly dreaded the notion of someone sitting down next to him, and this encounter was a prime example of why.\n\nIt must have been forever and six months, by Norman's reckoning, and it wasn't his stop yet.\n\nBefore his mind could be cluttered further by increasingly-personal details of Derrik's daily routine, Norman resolved to find something else to occupy his attention – a decision he would come to regret almost immediately. His wandering gaze latched upon a drooping bit of saliva navigating its way down Derrik's chin. It was a large droplet, glistening, heavy – did Derrik really not notice it? He must have. *Surely I must say something,* Norman thought, but the very idea of broaching the subject filled him with that familiar sensation of abstract dread.\n\nIt wasn't Norman's stop yet.\n\nNorman lost the thread of the conversation. It became evident that all he really needed to do was nod occasionally, and Derrik was content to rattle away. Norman felt a pang of guilt, perfectly aware that he was being at least somewhat rude, and put in a half-hearted effort to re-immerse himself in the tidal wave of inconsequential anecdotes flooding out of Derrik's mouth, but kept finding his perceptions drawn instead deeper and deeper into that large and ponderous bead of saliva.\n\nThere were worlds, galaxies spinning inside that bead. It shined, star-filled, with every passing street-light. Norman has identified and named ten constellations, and it still wasn't his stop yet.\n\n*It must fall off of his chin at some point,* Norman thought. He'd look away, but he couldn't – he was, ostensibly, in a conversation. *If the bead would fall off, I'm sure he'd notice, and wipe his face. I could stop looking at it.* But the saliva clung tenaciously to Derrik's face. It would wobble occasionally; Each time, Norman was filled with hope, and mild disappointment as it refused to move further.\n\nDerrik became angry about something. The change in tone prompted Norman's attention. It appeared that Derrik convinced himself that Norman was a supporter of some political party or other, a notion Derrik found concretely distasteful. His tone got louder, his gestures more wild, the flow of saliva from his mouth increased. Norman helplessly watched as Derrik worked himself into enough of an upset fervor that he got up and found another seat across the aisle. Time resumed, but inconveniently slowly, delayed by Norman's feelings of guilty anxiety at having been misunderstood and yelled at.\n\nNorman's stop came. Before he left the bus, he cast a last, mildly apologetic look at Derrik. In that moment, the drop of saliva came tumbling down. Derrik noticed, and wiped his face.\n\nAlthough Norman quickly forgot Derrik's name, everything about him, and that they even met at all, the profound sense of relief he felt at that moment would keep him reasonably chipper for most of the rest of the day." }

However, this one was for someone special.\n\nIt was late and all was quiet. Norman the Cat lay nestled by Norman’s feet fast asleep, and a dim light hung over the table - just enough for Norman to see the pen in his hand and the card on the table. *I need to focus*, Norman thought to himself. *But what should I say?* Norman rubbed his temples and closed his eyes, searching for words in his clouded mind. In doing so, Norman’s mind receded into distant memories. \n\n------------\n\nNorman paced back and forth in the crowded waiting room. His mind was racing miles a minute and his heart felt as if it would come right out of his chest. He had never been this nervous before. Not even the time he accidentally brought his boss decaf coffee instead of caffeinated coffee when he was an intern fresh out of college. He slid his hands in and out of his pockets as he’d always done when he was nervous and tried to place his focus elsewhere. Sitting across the room, Norman noticed a young boy that lay fast asleep on his father’s lap. In spite of his trepidations, Norman stopped to admire the look of peace on the boy, and the smile on his father’s face as he stared down at him. His pacing stopped, his hands were motionless, and he became calm. \n\n“Norman?” a distant voice called, snapping him back to reality. \n\n“Yes,” Norman replied as he turned to locate the voice. \n\n“Congratulations, Norman. It’s a boy. Mom and baby are both healthy” the nurse said. “Follow me.” \n\nA sense of excitement welled up in Norman as he began to follow the nurse to meet his son for the first time. As he exited the waiting room he glanced back once more at the father and son, and sent a silent thank you for calming his nerves. \n\n------------\n\nThe fond memory faded from Norman’s mind and focused back on the present. Norman couldn’t help but think of how difficult the past year had been for he and his family. He went from coming home to a wife and son, to a cat and an empty one-bedroom apartment. In spite of it all, he was still proud of being a father – his greatest accomplishment. \n\nJust then, Norman knew exactly what to say. He opened the card and wrote: *Happy Birthday, Son. I’m so proud of you. With Love, Dad*\n\nNorman closed the card and smiled. It was the easiest card he’d ever written. " }

{ "subreddit" : "lifeofnorman", "title" : "Norman's day", "text" : "Norman stared vacantly out of the back of the filthy public transportation bus window. Without meaning to, he had found himself slipping into a state of mind of which he did not often venture into often, for good reason. “What are my greatest accomplishments in life? Norman wondered. “where am I going from here”? He thought of that one time he single hand-idly wiped out all of the flies in the office in the span of an afternoon. Sighing glumly, Norman realized that this was not the kind of accomplishment he was looking for. As the bus neared the stop nearest to Normans single bedroom home, he slowly rose off of the cracked, dusty seat. \nLater that night, Norman lay in bed after a long day of typing up financial council and report forms. Spying a lone stranger walking the sidewalk outside, he thought back to the conversation he had had with Tau-Lu about refilling the ink cartridges in the printer when they ran out. Several co-workers always forgot to refill the printer, and that small hiccup in the smooth, bland day irked Norman. However, he was able to quickly move on from the interruption, and continue in his arduous but important task of typing up reports. Resuming work was a comfort for Norman, something he liked to think about when trying to fall asleep.\n\n\t\nAt precisely 6:35 AM, Norman stepped unto his regular bus route, and walked to the back of the bus, adjusting his broken glasses as he went. Norman had bent the frame of his glasses two months prior, after falling unto the metal floor of the bus. He had never gone to get them repaired, as he did not want to break his schedule unless necessary. Doing so is never comfortable.  Norman sat in the same seat every day, twice a day. Everyone on the bus line knew that the second-most aisle seat to the back was to be used twice a day, every day, by Norman. After a short trip to the corporate office, Norman ascended the elevator swiftly, arriving on time. Norman was greeted by glances, and a few whispered “hello’s” from the HR department as he passes by on the way to his cramped office. Checking the printer machine outside of the door labeled “NORMAN”, he was pleased to note the ink cartridge was nearly full, a welcome surprise. Norman shuffled into the small office, moving the chair back slightly to make room for the door to be opened. Sitting down, Norman pulled up his e-mail account. Already he could see a few spam e-mails addressed to him. Most came from the travel agency a few cities away, of which Norman made the mistake of breaking his normal schedule to go visit. He was less than thrilled with the prospect of travel after seeing all of the smiling hordes of people on the brochures, and left the brightly colored office with haste, to resume his schedule. But one email caught his eye. It was different for the rest. Norman took a small, calculated risk, and opened the email. Inside was a block of text inviting him to a new group therapy session beginning this Tuesday, and continuing once a week. Norman gave it a small amount of thought before deciding that it was not for him, and sending the email to the trash bin, to be deleted every thirty days with all other threads and spam he had no use for.\n\nLoping awkwardly out of the large office building with his worn briefcase, Norman hopped onto the bus. But not his usual line. Today was Tuesday, and after several days of thought, he had decided to attend the therapy session after work. It pained him to set aside his schedule, but with some healthy reasoning, Norman decided that the session could not do any harm. As a plus, he wouldn’t have to be around all of the people in the group for very long before he had to return home to rest before work the next day. Norman ambled to the back of the bus, only to find a large woman wearing a flower print dress and sun hat sitting in his usual seat. Norman slunk unhappily to the other side of the aisle. Already he knew that taking the time out of his schedule for this was a bad idea. 25 minutes later, Norman had arrived at the grand entrance to the “Samson and Koch Center for Mental Well-Being”. The name was too long, in Normans opinion. It was loud and bold, and took up a large amount of the front of the bricks above the doors. Norman sighed deeply as he walked in, noticing already a circle of chairs, 85% filled. Shuffling to the circle, he glanced suspiciously at the people on either side of his chair. They looked fairly innocuous, so Norman took a seat, glad not to be under judgment and scrutiny.\n\nAlready he felt out of place in his formal work attire, as most of the people here seemed to be men in their 20s – 40s who smelled strongly of alcohol and marijuana, and who looked decidedly unpleasant. The other half of the group looked to be made up of single mothers, a few of whom had to bring their small children along out of the need for a babysitter, but no money to pay one. “If all goes well”, thought Norman, “I may be able to leave without having to speak much”. Much later, after the sun had sunk into the horizon, Norman reflected on his life once more. He decided everything was just fine, for now.\n" }

While sitting in his old sofa recliner petting Norman, he dialed the number to the chair company. He waited anxiously while the phone rang, and was pleased when it was picked up on the fourth ring, and not on the third. Norman had a small distaste for odd numbers. He explained the situation to them calmly, and then chuckled to himself when they repeated the address. They had mistaken one of the numbers in his address for one of the house's across his street.

But there had been a lot of catching up work to be done with the extended holiday weekend the week before. It was Thursday, and 11:59am, and Norman thought he had earned a treat for himself and was going to go on his lunch hour a minute early. He reminded himself to leave a minute later at the end of the day to make up for it.     \n\nNorman went down to the cafeteria, even though he wasn't buying any food from down there. A couple of the tables were quietly occupied, and at one sat Kyle with a couple other people from the marketing department. Kyle was telling a story, and laughing loudly. The laugh was always the same volume and duration, no matter the quality of the joke, Norman thought as he attempted to walk by to a far table in the corner.    \n\n\"NORMAN!\" Kyle bellowed, a smile on his face. Norman slowed in front of their table. \"We NEVER see you down here!\"    \n\nBefore he could answer, Kyle held the bag of potato chips he had been eating from up to Norman, \"Chip?\"    \n\nNorman thought for a moment and throwing caution to the wind decided just one.

What felt like an eternity passed by as Norman struggled for a grip. He felt the eyes of the marketing folks upon him, even though one was absentmindedly scrolling through his phone. He wasn't sure if Kyle could feel the length of time, but he was attempting to remain calm without seeming like he was blaming Kyle for the grip on the bag. It was Norman's lack of foresight, after all.   \n\nQuickly and suddenly, his finger and thumb settled on two different chips and managed to bring them both to the surface. His panic faded into guilt. He'd only been offered one and was now unsure of what to do, but Kyle was already saying something about letting him know what he thought about the flavors, as there was some sort of contest going on.     \n\nNorman though was lost in thought as he walked away to his table. He now had nowhere to put this second rogue chip, and he certainly wasn't going to eat both at once, not with this mystery flavor going about.

Norman day-dreamed about what sort of day-dreaming he would do back in the comfort of his recliner, a cat in his lap and a tea in hand.\n\nNorman was caught mid-smile as the curtain was pushed open, a small head peeking through, looking square at Norman.

The next day again no one seemed to notice or didnt care. He was relieved, but perplexed he had spent his money too frivolously to garner some attention right? The next day his cubical neighbor Stan  mentioned his glasses and even complimented them. Though Norman was flattered those glasses wouldn't do either. That was not the attention he wanted (he only wanted attention from the fairer sex).

She didn't notice his big change; he was losing hope. \n\nThe last day he questioned if he shouldn't even risk trying the last pair, but since he had ordered it. He felt obligated to try all the glasses or else he would be lying, when he returned the glasses. He wouldn't know if the last pair would have satisfied him or not. Norman's moral obligations almost always out weighed his fears. (He would always return a strangers wallet unless they looked like a thug or were scarily large in which he would drop it off at the police station) The last day of the work week. He hoped no one had noticed this last change he was almost home free. How stupid wasting a $100 dollars, when he had a perfectly fine pair all along he thought. At the end of the day in rare occurence he saw Lisa as he was about to enter his car. She was about to enter her's. In all the clamity of the week he didn't even realise he had parked next to her, which he usely avoided so he didn't seem like he was desperate for her attention. \n   \"Hey I Norman. I just wanted to say I like your new glasses.\" Said Lisa bashfully.\n     Norman smiled and thanked her. Then entered his car and proceeded home.

He had a sudden first-hand understanding of so many rap lyrics, and he felt cooler for it.\n\nThen came the guilt, hitting hard and fast like a speeding cab at a virtual intersection. He had to lie down.\n\nQuestions flooded his mind. Why did he have to hit *her*? An old man stood just to the left. If he had tilted the thumbstick one-degree of arc further, it would’ve been the old man instead of her. Wouldn’t that have been more humane?\n\nHe wondered how he would feel if the roles were reversed. If, in some other game universe, she was the one who had sped through virtual traffic, while he got to play the character standing motionless at a crosswalk. He wouldn't have liked that at all.\n\nWith a whimpering sigh it dawned on him: this woman probably had a family back home who would miss her. Was she a mother? Did she have friends? Was there a favourite food she would never taste again? Just then Norman crawled onto Norman’s lap, and Norman thought, “Oh no! What if she has a cat who will never snuggle her again!?”\n\nIt was all too much.\n\nAs he pondered the digital woman’s life, he heard sirens slowly growing louder on his TV screen. He sat up and started for the controller, but thought better of it. Even when the police arrived and threw his character to the ground, slapping the cuffs on him, Norman refrained from fighting back. “No,” he thought. “Justice must be served.”\n\nBut a moment later, after an all-too-brief loading screen / prison sentence, the police released him outside the station. A light fine, that was it. And then he was free to go. Maybe they had bumbled the case, or he'd been set free because they hadn't read him his Miranda Rights. Either way, the wolf was back amongst the sheep.\n\nNorman wiped his palms on his pant legs. He took a sip of his orange juice. Then, with a twisted smile, he reached for the controller. He chuckled. “Looks like this one… was a flat fare,” he quipped, three minutes too late." }

It was something that he liked to do every so often under the pretense of staying active. As he walked past his neighbors’ houses he liked to peek in to see what they were up to. He never stared outright but instead kept his face forward and let his eyes glance over quickly. Many of them had tall hedges or fences that were impossible to see past but inevitably they would have a gate that was low enough or was slatted enough to see through. He would see people unpacking their shopping, talking with their family as they got home, or most often just undulating light reflecting off the walls as people watched their TV’s. It made him happy to see people enjoying their routines bathed in the golden glow of their homes. It reminded him of how much he enjoyed curling up with Norman for CSI after dinner. \n\nThat last thought made a pang of hunger shoot through his stomach. He was hungry, and it almost was time for CSI too. Norman quickened his pace and quickly got to his front door. All the lights were off. *Oh no! When I left the landlord was home but he must have gone out. How will I get inside?!* He fretted and called out but there was no response. *Maybe he left a window open*, he thought and proceeded to sidle down the narrow passage between his house and the neighbour’s. At the back of the house Norman could see that the landlord had left the upstairs bathroom window open which was conveniently close to a strong branch extending from a tree that Norman had not even contemplated in a long time. *I can’t believe I forgot about this tree. I should come into the back yard more often.* The tree had many branches which looked rather climbable and Norman could see a fairly straightforward path up the tree to the bathroom window. *Am I really considering this?* Norman had not climbed a tree since he was young. He remembered getting stuck up a tree once and after that he had never climbed again. But by now his stomach was eating itself and CSI was due start so it had to be done. Norman, slowly but surely, edged his way up the tree, testing every foothold before trusting his weight to it. *How embarrassing*, he thought as he crawled along the final branch on his belly, *I hope the neighbours don’t see me!* Finally he was at the bathroom window and able to slither through headfirst, landing his hands and then his feet safe on the bathroom floor. He sat there for a few minutes, waiting for the fuzziness in his head to pass, breathing hard.\n\nThe house remained dark as he made his way downstairs on trembling legs to the couch. His hunger was forgotten as the adrenaline continued to twist his belly. It seemed like he was sitting only a minute before he heard the key turn in the latch. *What terrible timing he has*, thought Norman and he turned his head to watch as the light flicked on and Norman stumbled through the door with a large shopping bag in his arms. \n\n“Hello Norman,” he said.\n\n“It’s time for CSI,” said Norman, but Norman didn’t understand and went to put the shopping away.\n\n“I got you some fresh meat,” and he spooned it out into Norman’s bowl before putting the milk away and setting a TV dinner in the microwave.\n\n“Thank you, but I am not feeling well,” said Norman and waited for Norman to sit down. \n\n“Not feeling well, eh buddy?”\n\nFinally, the TV was flicked on and a lap formed as Norman sat down. Norman stretched and climbed onto Norman’s legs, turned around once to curl into a ball and relaxed into his lap.

It’s daylight savings today; I hope you had a good day,” he scritched him behind his ears.\n\nNorman didn’t know what that meant but he felt the golden glow of lights and the TV flickered up on the walls.

Please take a moment in your day to wish him Happy Birthday!”\n***\n\nNorman hesitated. He quickly closed the email, just in case Frank saw it. It would spoil any surprise birthday parties, if anyone had happened to plan one for him. Norman then had to consider his options- say Happy Birthday to his face and risk stumbling over his words, or write a carefully worded, but less thoughtful, email? \n\n“Hey Norman,” said Frank as he swung his chair around, “it’s my birthday.”\n\n\n“Oh really? Happy-birday,” Norman slurred unconvincingly. He wished that Frank had said that to him in an email instead. \n\t\n“Since it’s Friday, I’m looking for someone to get drunk with tonight. I don’t normally ask you, but all I know is I’m not getting home until it’s real late. You in?”\n\n\nNorman scoured his mind for an excuse, but as his head swiveled slowly in deep thought, Frank took it as a nod of agreement.\n\t\n“Great. Let’s start at five.”\n\n\nNorman gulped in anticipation.\n" }

Bob seeing an opportunity to get his sales numbers up expressed the benefits of an expensive Makita and the accompanying bit collection.  Norman was happy with his decisive purchase, no doubt fueled by the overzealous salesman.    Once home, Norman commenced with hanging a mirror that had been in the garage for years waiting to be appreciated. That salesman had also sold Norman some wall anchors, just in case, and Norman thought now was as good a time as any to put them to use.  He did some research on the internet as to their use and stared at the wall working up the courage to begin.  Norman looked on with a full belly and an inquisitive look wondering what Norman was up to.  Norman read and followed all of the instructions that came with the driver and was ready to begin. Norman carefully placed the anchor against the wall, placed the bit against the anchor and pulled the trigger.   Before he knew what was happening, the anchor was through the wall along with a couple of inches of the very nice Makita.  Norman stared at the wall and hoped his neighbor on the other side would be understanding.  Norman purred and circled his legs enjoying his self-induced back rub.

He had just finished shaving and was reaching for a paper towel. It was then he noticed something important was very much absent in his reflection.  \n\nHe probed his off-color hands over his smoothed cheeks, completely awestruck at the new face staring strangely back at him. Short, black hair; squinted eyes; fat yellow cheeks; all features that were surprising to suddenly appear in Norman’s mirror in the middle of his routine. \"This isn’t my face! But yet…\" it seemed to fit snugly over his body. He probed it freely, moved the muscles easily without discomfort, as if he had practice wearing it before. \"But where,\" he wondered dimly, \"…my face, this isn’t my face. Why am I seeing this?\" He was caught deep in the struggle to derive some reason from this anomaly. His whole mind engulfed itself in the paradox, and he did not realize that he was slowly backing away from the sink.

Please, why am I seeing this?\" \"Why does this have to happen now?\" He whimpered loudly, the words rang painfully in his head. He stood himself up only to fall over, leaning on the bathroom door. He clasped his hand to his face, keeping out the light from hurting his head. \"What is happening?\" He whispered, tears trickling between his fingers. \"There’s a reason; this isn’t just happening\" he thought \"There is a reason.\" He wiped his hand on a pant-leg and dimmed the bathroom lights. Standing in line with the mirror, he began taking a focused examination over his new face.\n\nThe probing began with his eyes- studying the color, the number of eyelashes, the pigment beneath the eyelids, the brightness of the blood vessels, and other minute details. He then moved to the nose, ears, mouth, hair, eyebrows, chin, forehead, and whatever was left of the face. Finally, he came to the conclusion which seemed most acceptable to him, in light of his findings.\n\n\"It’s just a dream. It’s just a dream\" He told himself, turning away from the mirror. \"This is nothing more than a dream, or rather a nightmare. Obviously I am still lying unconscious in the tub, and everything that’s happening now is just a product of that concussion. My mind is just confused.\" He took the train further \"Perhaps even, I’m still lying in bed, and all this is just an elaborate way of signaling my brain that I had overslept the alarm.\" But with this invention came the expected epiphany: \"But if I am suddenly aware of all this now, why haven’t I woken up?\"  He left his bathroom and began pacing incessantly in his bedroom, attempting desperately to weave together again his unravelling dream-theory. \"Perhaps another blow,\" he thought, \"will do the trick.\" But he had to grapple with the possibility that he may be awake, and that it was his conscious mind that was ailing him. \"There’s a chance I’m suffering from a nervous breakdown, that this is all part of some freak out. But then, what can I do?\" But this idea didn’t satisfy him, for apart from the obvious symptom, his mind was working quite as it always had. \n\nHe took to TV as his mind roamed farther into bleaker thoughts.

He'd just played a energetic round of tennis with his neighbor whom he didn't intend to keep in touch with should he ever move away. \n\n\"I better fix dinner before I get comfortable.\" Norman decided, heaving himself up to a standing position. He opened his refrigerator and stood back. \"Nothing to eat in here. It's too full.\" He closed the door and thought a moment. He wondered in his head \"Do I want a whole meal or would a well choreographed snack be sufficient? I guess I did have an early lunch.\" Norman opened his freezer and found two perfectly good options. Half a box of fish sticks or a frozen pizza with pesto and sun-dried tomatoes. He settled on the fish sticks, since they were open. He read the directions and turned the knob to preheat his oven for the specified 325 degrees Fahrenheit. \n\nNorman returned to his favorite spot in the couch, where he'd left a \"comfort\" indentation, to wait for the oven to warm. Just as he was about to sit, it occurred to him, he'd been out of town last weekend. So the fish sticks may be older than he originally expected. He checked the expiration date, and sure enough, they'd turned two days prior. He put his textured slippers on and tossed the box in the outside trash so they wouldn't emanate a fishy odor in thawing in the kitchen trash. He returned and went about putting the pizza in the oven. Fortunately the pizza was also to be cooked at 325 degrees, so no further manipulation of the oven was required. \n\nFinally situated on the couch, he flipped the TV on to channel 12 ice hockey. Or at least, he tried to. The remote wouldn't turn on the television. He tried aiming it at different spots of the TV. He took his cable box out of the cabinet so it was visible to the remote. When that didn't work he finally, begrudgingly, went to the supply drawer at the other end of the room to find a D battery and screwdriver with which to change it. \n\nHe made a note on his pad to buy more D batteries as he returned to the couch. But the battery change was futile. \"I'm sure I still have that warranty card somewhere.\" Norman thought as he gritted his teeth. After searching through old receipts he recovered the manual and purchase agreement which held the warranty code. He located the 1-800 number on his cable box and went through the touch tone menu, then was placed on a brief hold. They played a pleasant mix of muzak and light rock whilst he waited. \n\nWhen an operator came on, he described the issue and the steps he'd taken to troubleshoot it. The operator, who claimed his name was \"Pat\" but was definitely born with a name closer to \"Indrajit\", was mild mannered but efficient. He asked Norman for his zip code, which he provided. He was then placed on another hold to the tune of a pop song which he cared for less than the previous selection. \n\nPat returned a minute later. \"Norman, I am pleased to inform you that EveryTown cable will be able to replace your remote at no extra charge as you are within your warranty expiry date. You can have it shipped to you or you may pick it up at any of our partner stores such as Best Buy or Radio Shack. In the meantime you will find all the regular remote functions are accessible through manual buttons on your cable box. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you, and would like to credit your account $25 to be put towards your next cable bill.\" Norman thanked them for their assistance and arranged to have the new remote shipped to him. He declined expedited shipping as he was going out of town again soon, and wanted to be home to receive the package. \n\nHe hung up the phone and, using a hot pad, removed his pizza from the oven. Transferring it to a plate he sat down to watch his ice hockey game. The pizza was a bit undercooked but Norman had already turned off the oven and decided it was fine as it was. " }

They had crossed the street and were heading toward “Double Buns and Burgers” restaurant.

Here’s an apron-you can thank me later honey”\n\nShe went to the backroom. Meanwhile, Norman just stood blankly, clutching at his apron. He gazed over the food-counter, over the stoves and the dining area. His eyes fixed, unblinking, watching each employee in action: the cashier assisting customers, the cooks grilling burgers and chopping vegetables, the janitor pulling a mop and bucket into the bathroom; each and every one wearing that fat, eggshell-colored countenance that he had so carefully studied just after this morning’s concussion.

Usually, he would just have leftovers, but he was going on his third day of chicken and it was starting to be less appetizing with each passing day.  He needed something different, but what?\n\nSlowly he wandered up and down the aisles, looking for anything that might strike his fancy.  Frozen dinner?  A sandwich from the deli?  Nothing was really sticking out.  He took out his kerchief and wiped the sweat from his brow.  It had been very warm lately and he had parked so far away that he built up a sweat on the way into the store.  Hot weather always reminded Norman of his love for BBQ.  \"That's it\" he thought, \"I'll grill up a juicy steak for dinner!\"\n\nNorman hurriedly shuffled to the meat department, eager to peruse the fine selections.  A delicious looking T-Bone caught his eye.  It was his favorite cut, and this one had beautiful marbling.  Alas, a look at the price tag reminded Norman that he was on a tight budget.  Eventually Norman arrived at the end of the display, where the discounted meats were sold.  He found a New York Strip that was 50% off.  Upon closer inspection, the steak was getting close to the end of its shelf life, and what was once a bright red steak was now gray in spots, and had a silvery sheen when held at an angle.  It was still good, and would fit Norman's needs.\n\nUpon arriving at home, Norman cleared the spiderwebs from his trusty charcoal grill (an old Weber he found on Spring Clean Out Day in his old neighborhood).  A quick scrub on the rusty grate with a well-worn steel brush, a fair amount of lighter fluid on the store brand charcoal briquettes, and soon blue smoke poured forth.\n\nWhile the coals were getting hot, Norman prepared his steak.  He had already poked holes in his potato, and it was slowly turning in the microwave.  He cut the Saran Wrap and drained the blood into his sink.  There was a little bit of slime, but a good scrubbing under cold water helped that.  \n\nNow that it was clean, Norman could see that there wasn't as much marbling as he liked.  Reaching into a drawer, Norman pulled out his meat tenderizer, the spiked hammer he had found at the church rummage sale 3 years ago.  Covering the steak with foil, Norman began to beat his meat furiously, breaking down the connective tissue.   A dash of salt and pepper (from the shakers you see at picnics with cobs of corn printed on the side), and the steak was ready to cook.  \n\nPlacing the tenderized steak on the searing hot grill, Norman took pleasure in hearing the sizzle.

Resting on top of the tallest hill, its residents saw the long and narrow valley below, and far off in the distance, on the other side of the valley, were tall mountain peaks whose high tips were touched by snow of the purest white. It was a rather large neighborhood, and beautiful, nearing 2000 acres of land with some of the most opulent houses money could buy. Most of them were two stories in height, with complementing colors and intricate details and boasting large and pretty gardens cultivated by masterful gardeners. There were grand exceptions though; one in particular was the house that belonged to Doctor Eugen. To call it a mere house would be a misidentification. Truly it was a mansion that towered four stories tall and was surrounded by a proper field with a hedge maze, olympic sized swimming pool, game court, and garden. A big garden. Every day Doctor Eugen would get in his black Phantom Rolls Royce and drive to work. There was a smooth, dark road with many twists and turns that wound its way through Vista Overlook and this was the road Doctor Eugen would take to exit the neighborhood. On his way out, however, the sight of Doctor Eugen would meet the hideous appearance of a rather out-of-place dwelling on the edge of Vista Overlook. This one house was the only poor exception to the great material prosperity of the other residents of Vista Overlook. The home in consideration was only one story tall and much of it was falling apart. In fact, to a keen observer, the whole plot of land was askew, tilting away from the much nicer homes. Doctor Eugen saw this one bad mark on an otherwise pristine habitation and this filled him with disgust and contempt.\n\nThis was where Norman lived.\n\nAs Doctor Eugen approached the home of Norman in his black Rolls Royce, he saw a lonely man in his dirty bath robes standing before it in the driveway. This man was bald with a wrinkled face, in his early forties, and leaned slightly to his right on account of the arthritis in his left foot. In his right hand he was holding a mug of black coffee and in his left arm he was holding a pretty little white cat. \n\nThis was Norman. Doctor Eugen hated Norman. \n\nNorman and his cat, also called Norman, knew how much Doctor Eugen hated him, yet this did not stop Norman from waving at Doctor Eugen like any good neighbor would do. However, at the sight of this friendly gesture, Doctor Eugen became angry and firmly pressed down on the gas pedal of his black Rolls Royce and its tires lost their grip on the ground and promptly \"burned rubber\". This rather hurt Norman's feelings. He thought: \"Why does he hate me as such? I have always been a good neighbor to him! Since I've been living here, always waving at him or saying 'How do you do?' when he leaves for work. This will not bother me today, oh no. Today is going to be a good day! I can just feel it!\"\n\nAnd on that thought, Norman, with his cat and cup of coffee, went inside his unimpressive abode to finish getting ready for the day's work ahead of him.\n\n-----" }

While waiting, he considered telling the young woman that this was only a temporary job, and that if she were his mother, she would not be disappointed in him.\n\n\nThe elevator doors opened.

He fell through a glass table. He screamed, \"It's my delivery! You fuckin' idiot!\"\n\n\nNorman felt as though his testicles were in his chest, and that they exploded. The doors were almost shut. Norman jerked his hand forward to stop them, but he was too late. His middle finger crunched as it broke backwards on the metal door.\n\n\nNorman punched the stop button to keep the doors shut. He balled into a corner, and cried into his shaking fists. All that mattered to him was staying in this womb, but he knew he'd be pulled out.\n\n\nNorman slid off the pizza bag, then opened the box.

We do our best to guess people's ages accurately, but it's not a very exact science. \n\n**In the case that we remove a post and the person is actually above 16, we ask that they provide proof of age with something like a government ID or student ID via modmail, which is private.**\n\nPlease remember: none of us are photo analysis experts, so we will make mistakes.\n---\n\n*P.s. we do keep track of people who break rules. There is a three strike policy in effect, and after three strikes you may be banned without warning.

How would required genetic testing change the structure of Wellness Programs and affect employees with a familial history of genetic disorders?\n\nThe only argument for the bill that I can come up with is that if someone who has a genetic disorder that prevents them from meeting the Wellness Program goals, then they could still receive the benefits if they provide their employer with their genetic testing results.

For a time, the change seemed to have at least some positive effect in the intended direction:  Trump began using a teleprompter more often rather than solely speaking off-the-cuff, and Trump's legendary Twitter outbursts seemed to become less frequent.  Trump's campaign staff (and children) were able to convince the nominee to go with a more \"traditional\" VP pick in Mike Pence to placate the Republican base, even though Trump reportedly was not very confident in the pick.\n\nHowever, if this report is true, it seems the Trump campaign staff may be giving up on that goal, and reverting back to Lewandowski's \"Just let Trump be Trump\" campaign strategy.\n\n------\n\nMany possible implications to discuss:  \n\n* If Manafort is no longer trying to rein Trump in, will we see even more attacks on the likes of the Khan family, as well as more attacks on purported \"allies\" like Paul Ryan and John McCain?\n\n* Does this make the prospect of Presidential debates more or less likely?  (That is, is Trump's recent skittishness on the prospect of debates coming from himself, or was it a strategy that came from his campaign advisors, which he may now abandon?)\n\n* How does this affect Trump's fundraising?  One of the earliest stories about the interaction between Manafort and Trump was that the new campaign manager had to essentially beg Trump to put in the work to raise campaign donations.  If Trump is back to calling all the shots, does he go back to his old ways, when he was only raising a few million dollars per month with next to no cash on hand?" }

Just what I have been saying. African-Americans will VOTE TRUMP!\n\nThe comparison is already being made to Trump's \"appreciate the congrats\" tweet after the Orlando shooting, which seemed to hurt him among many voters for the way he seemed callous in response to tragedy. \n\nThis joins Trump's week and change of reaching out to the black community in ways that have caused as much trouble for him as they've helped. Media outlets noted that his outreach to blacks happened in white neighborhoods and to white crowds. His \"What do you have to lose?\" comment seemed to many to be essentially negging the black community, and some raised objections at the dismal view of black America he claimed. \n\nThe whole attempt of Trump to look better on the issue of race has also opened up a Clinton attack on him—Clinton made her speech linking him to the alt-right, and released ads showing KKK members and other white nationalists endorsing his candidacy. \n\nTrump has a real problem with African American voters. To [quote Larry Sabato] (https://twitter.com/LarrySabato/status/767474591979671552): \n\n&gt;Trump polls 1-2% among blacks. In '64 Goldwater got 6% after voting no on the Civil Rights Act.

Trump is not trying to get AA to vote for him as much as get white moderates to not think he's racist.

Keith Ellison, D-Minn., a Sanders ally: \"We've made some substantial moves forward.\"\n\n**A very important thing to consider while analyzing this release:**\n\n&gt;The platform is a statement of the party's values and positions on a wide range of issues. While it does not bind the Democratic nominee to specific policies, it serves as a guidepost for the party moving forward.\n\nIsraeli-Palestinian Conflict:\n\n&gt;The committee defeated an amendment led by Zogby that would have called for providing Palestinians with \"an end to occupation and illegal settlements\" and urged an international effort to rebuild Gaza.\n\n&gt;The draft reflects Clinton's views and advocates working toward a \"two-state solution of the Israel-Palestinian conflict\" that guarantees Israel's security with recognized borders \"and provides the Palestinians with independence, sovereignty, and dignity.\"\n\nVague reference to Social Security:\n\n&gt;The document calls for the expansion of Social Security\n\nThe $15 minimum wage:\n\n&gt;referring to the current minimum wage of $7.25 an hour as a \"starvation wage\"\n\n&gt;Sanders' allies wanted the draft to specify that a $15 per hour minimum wage should be indexed with inflation. Clinton's side struck down that idea, noting the document included a call to \"raise and index the minimum wage.\"\n\nBreaking up big banks:\n\n&gt;supports ways to prevent banks from gambling with taxpayers' bank deposits, \"including an updated and modernized version of Glass-Steagall.\" Sanders wants to reinstate the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act, which prohibited commercial banks from engaging in investment banking activities. Clinton does not, but says her proposed financial changes would cast a wider net by regulating the banking system.\n\nThe death penalty:\n\n&gt;a call for the abolition of the death penalty\n\nThe TPP:\n\n&gt;the group voted down the measure opposing the TPP\n\nSanders' reaction:\n\n&gt;Sanders, in a statement, said he was \"disappointed and dismayed\" that the group voted down the measure opposing the TPP. But he was pleased with the proposals on Glass-Steagall and the death penalty - and vowed to fight on. \"Our job is to pass the most progressive platform in the history of the Democratic Party,\" he said.\n\nThat's everything laid out in the Associated Press article, so some very big questions arise:\n\n1) How much did Sanders' platform and movement affect this draft? It seems there are some very clear compromises.\n\n2) How will these compromises affect the centrists and far left that she's trying to court? Will the demographic (all and any of them) of her support change?\n\n3) Do you think this is the kind of thing the party needed to do to get Sanders' endorsement as he outlined it yesterday?\n\n4) What does this mean going forward going for the Democratic party? As in, there are some truly progressive measures and not so progressive measures in this draft, do you think this trend will continue and how?\n\n5) How will this affect voters when contrasted with Trump's extremism? Is this the kind of balance and pragmatism that Clinton has been vigorously advocating for herself?\n\n\nLink to article:\n\nhttp://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_DEMOCRATS_PLATFORM?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT" }

The only two types of ranked choice voting systems that are currently being used in governmental elections are instant-runoff voting (IRV), and single transferable vote (STV). STV is only used in multiple-seat races, as in, where a single vote decides the outcomes of multiple seats, as in therefore not relevant for this question. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n**IRV:** IRV is used in single seat election where there are more than two candidates, and works in the following way. “Instead of voting only for a single candidate, in IRV, voters can rank the candidates in order of preference. Ballots are initially counted for each elector's top choice. If a candidate secures more than half of these votes, that candidate wins. Otherwise, the candidate in last place is eliminated and removed from consideration. The top remaining choices on all the ballots are then counted again. This process repeats until one candidate is the top remaining choice of a majority of the voters. When the field is reduced to two, it has become an \"instant runoff\" that allows a comparison of the top two candidates head-to-head.” (from Wikipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nFor context, IRV is used in Australia at the federal and state levels, in the UK, New Zealand, and some cities (Oakland, CA from 2010-present, San Francisco, CA from 2004-present) in the US. It was also adopted by the US state of Maine as of the 2016 election, and will apply to races for Congress, Governor, and State Legislature from 2018 onwards. To read more on Maine, https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/03/us/maine-ranked-choice-voting.html).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n**Context in US Politics:**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nRanked choice voting also has at least some bipartisan support from both Republicans and Democrats, with both 2008 Presidential Candidates (then Senators McCain and Obama) supporting the effort (source - an OP-ED written by Howard Dean, the former DNC chairman, Governor of Vermont, and Presidential Candidate - https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/08/opinion/howard-dean-how-to-move-beyond-the-two-party-system.html?_r=0).

He made a set of projections for how each state would go if the race was a 50/50 tie, factoring in the demographic advantages of both candidates as shown in the first three primaries and the assumed Hillary landslide in South Carolina.\n\nI figured that if he was right, that means that now looking back his demographic projections from then should've by and large held up. So I copied Nate's numbers into excel, added the actual winners, and looked for the margin that made Nate's projections line up the closest with the actual end result:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/mOBCNIL\n\nThe result is that giving Hillary a 3% advantage over the 50/50 margin ends up correctly predicting the winner 41 out of 47 times, or 87%.

I think this is an interesting question but I'm seeing a lot of these postmortems adopting the 'momentum' interpretation suggesting if only Sanders had done this or that to take advantage of his 'momentum' after winning this or that state he still could've pulled through. But I think the above shows that, while there might very well be things Sanders could've done in 2015, once the primaries started it was about demographics and the vast majority of states went as they were predicted to go way back in February.\n\nAnyone else agree, or disagree?

{ "subreddit" : "politicaldiscussion", "title" : "A U.S. District judge has struck down Mississippi's sweeping religious freedom laws (HB 1523).", "text" : "From the WaPo article:\n\n&gt;Just minutes before House Bill 1523 was to take effect at midnight, (U.S. District Judge Carlton W.) Reeves eviscerated the bill — the most sweeping attempt by a state to undermine the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2015 decision to legalize gay marriage — as being in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\nFrom Reeves:\n\n&gt;Religious freedom was one of the building blocks of this great nation, and after the nation was torn apart, the guarantee of equal protection under law was used to stitch it back together. But HB 1523 does not honor that tradition of religion freedom, nor does it respect the equal dignity of all of Mississippi’s citizens. It must be enjoined.\n\n&gt;The State has put its thumb on the scale to favor some religious beliefs over others. Showing such favor tells non adherents that they are outsiders, not full members of the political community, and . . . adherents that they are insiders, favored members of the political community. And the Equal Protection Clause is violated by HB 1523’s authorization of arbitrary discrimination against lesbian, gay, transgender, and unmarried persons. The plaintiffs’ motions are granted and HB 1523 is preliminarily enjoined.\n\nHow this will end up working now:\n\n&gt;The preliminary injunction will hold until any appeals are completed. Then, if upheld, they will be filed as permanent injunctions.\n\nSome background on the bill:\n\n&gt;The bill, officially titled as the “Protecting Freedom of Conscience from Government Discrimination Act,” was authored by state House Speaker Philip Gunn (R).\n\n&gt;His resulting bill easily passed the Republican-controlled House and Senate. Gov. Phil Bryant (R)...signed it April 5.\n\n&gt;It sought to protect Mississippians who had three specific religious beliefs: That marriage was between one man and one woman, that sex is reserved for heterosexual married couples and that gender is determined at birth. Court clerks would be allowed to deny marriage licenses to same sex couples by asserting a religious offense. A single mother could be fired from her job. Any private business owner could refuse service to anyone they perceived to be gay by citing the above religious beliefs.\n\nSo how far reaching is this going to be? Is this going to lead to increased protection from discrimination for the LGBT community, or is this more or less an isolated incident? Could this be used to/does this ultimately put sexuality in the same protected class as things like speech and religion?\n\n*(Quick side note, I'm posting this at 3:30 AM EST because I have no life lol, I'll try to keep up with any updates as people start breaking this down in the morning.)*\n\nLink to article:\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/us-district-judge-strikes-down-mississippis-religious-freedom-law/2016/07/01/f98dc2ca-3ec9-11e6-a66f-aa6c1883b6b1_story.html" }

But it seems virtually impossible that he could win a majority of pledged delegates. \n\nThe nomination is no longer a realistic possibility for him, unless the superdelegates overturn the popular vote for him. If he won the nomination in this way somehow, could he possibly still be viable for November?\n\n2) Alternatively, he may be seeking to influence the party platform. But why? The platform is, by all accounts, rather irrelevant. And regardless, he has a minority of pledged delegates. Simple mathematics would indicate that he cannot win a floor fight on any truly controversial issues. Which seems to be few and far in between anyway. Sanders platform, as far as I can tell, don't really disagree with Hillary's except in degrees and methods.\n\nWhat might he hope to ask for at the Convention, that could be worth the effort to him?

But a third party run would certainly ensure a Trump presidency, and it doesn't seem credible that Bernie will be willing to go that far.  He could perhaps uses that possibility to threaten the Democrats into conceding to his demands, but such a divisive tactic seem to me like it would help ensure a Trump victory in November.\n\nIs this a realistic strategy for him to pursue?\n\n----\n\nEssentially, I see no realistic or meaningful dividends that going to the convention fighting could yield.

Mainly the part that raids $18 billion in war funds at a time of war, in order to buy force structure that the department has not requested and may be unable to support in the future.\n\n* \"At issue is a move by House leaders this year and last year to use a supplemental war spending account, called 'Overseas Contingency Operations', to increase overall defense spending while leaving other federal agencies under strict congressional budget caps. The Defense Department’s base budget is subject to these caps, but its war-spending account is not—so Republicans have sought to game the system by using overseas money to fund base programs. This year they've gone even further, seeking to fund operations in Afghanistan and Iraq for only half of the next fiscal year. The House budget would shift money from the overseas contingency account to pay for base programs, forcing the next administration to seek supplemental war funds\".\n\n* The leaked memo details the strategies the Pentagon can use to play hardball against Speaker Ryan's plan—including the presidential veto, playing the Senate against the House (Senators McCain and Cochran are named), targetting House committee members who may be less than enthused about Ryan's plan, getting top military officials to publicly speak out against it, etc. Kinda juicy." }

His term as a State Senator ended 8 days before the new gubernatorial term. Since he was no longer a State Senator, he also no longer held the authority to be governor. \n\nAlready kind of weird but not unheard of, the process would be to transfer the title to the new State Senate President for those 8 transitional days. Except that, following the new election, there was a perfectly equal balance of power in the State Senate, meaning there were two co-presidents (one from each party). There was nothing in writing as to how to handle this situation, so ultimately each co-president got to be acting governor for 4 days (the NJ Attorney General, next in the line of succession, was governor for 90 minutes while this was all officialized) before the new governor-elect was finally sworn in. \n\nBecause this was so unique, and garnered brief national attention, each of the two \"co-governors\" performed official business, traveled the state, had letterheads printed up with their name as governor, etc, despite their extremely limited terms. \n\nNew Jersey had a ballot initiative to create a lieutenant governor position shortly after this, which passed. \n\nWhat are other crazy legal minutiae/procedural rarities that have happened in the past?" }

{ "subreddit" : "politicaldiscussion", "title" : "The Democratic Party Platform has included a federal minimum wage of $15, claiming it will give power to workers and lift individuals and families out of poverty. Will raising the minimum wage accomplish these goals, and what would be the overall effects of this policy?", "text" : "[The Democratic Party Platform](https://www.demconvention.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Democratic-Party-Platform-7.21.16-no-lines.pdf) has included a federal minimum wage of $15 an hour. This means, in essence, that no worker will be permitted to work for any wage below this limit. Supporters argue that this policy lifts individuals and families out of poverty, and boost the wages of workers nationwide. It should be noted that the federal poverty line for individuals is $11,880, and assuming that a worker at the current minimum wage of $7.25 works a standard 40 hours, they annual salary would amount to $15,080.\n\n&gt;Democrats believe that the current minimum wage is a starvation wage and must be increased to a living wage. No one who works full time should have to raise a family in poverty. We believe that Americans should earn at least $15 an hour and have the right to form or join a union and will work in every way we can—in Congress and the federal government, in states and with the private sector—to reach this goal. We should raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. \n\nIt is important that we review the difference between normative and positive statements briefly. Normative statements are those that are prescriptive, which say what *should* or *ought* to be done. Positive statements are descriptive, they describe how the world is. Because of differences in philosophical viewpoints, normative statements tend to vary among different individuals.\n\n\nIn the field of economics this kind of policy prescription (the minimum wage) is known as a [price floor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_floor):\n\n&gt;A price floor is a government- or group-imposed price control or limit on how low a price can be charged for a product.\n\nThere are many opponents of this minimum wage as well. For example:\n\n&gt;Nearly three-quarters (72%) of these US based economists oppose (50% strongly and 22% somewhat) a federal minimum wage of $15.00 per hour. ^[source](https://www.epionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Nov2015_EPI_MinWageSurvey4.pdf)\n\nAccording to economist, Gregor Mankiw:\n\n&gt;Opponents of the minimum wage contend that it is not the best way to combat poverty. They note that a high minimum wage causes unemployment, encourages teenagers to drop out of school, and prevents some unskilled workers from getting the on-the-job training they need. Moreover, opponents of the minimum wage point out that it is a poorly targeted policy. Not all minimum wage workers are heads of households trying to help their families escape poverty. In fact, fewer than a third of minimum-wage earners are in families with incomes below the poverty line. Many are teenagers from middle-class homes working at part-time jobs for extra spending money. ^1\n\n&gt;Many economists have studied how minimum-wage laws affect the teenage labor market. These researchers compare the changes in the minimum wage over time with the changes in teenage employment. Although there is some debate about how much the minimum wage affects employment, the typical study finds that a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage depresses teenage employment between 1 and 3 percent. In interpreting this estimate, note that a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage does not raise the average wage of teenagers by 10 percent. A change in the law does not directly affect those teenagers who are already paid well above the minimum, and enforcement of minimum-wage laws is not perfect. Thus, the estimated drop in employment of 1 to 3 percent is significant. ^1\n\n&gt;In addition to altering the quantity of labor demanded, the minimum wage alters the quantity supplied. Because the minimum wage raises the wage that teenagers can earn, it increases the number of teenagers who choose to look for jobs. Studies have found that a higher minimum wage influences which teenagers are\nemployed. When the minimum wage rises, some teenagers who are still attending high school choose to drop out and take jobs. These new dropouts displace other teenagers who had already dropped out of school and who now become unemployed. ^1\n\nIt should be noted that a key feature of the Democratic Party Platform combating youth unemployment:\n\n&gt;Roughly one in ten Americans between the ages of 16 and 24 is unemployed, more than twice the national average. The unemployment rates for African American, Latino, Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI), and American Indian teenagers and youth with disabilities are far too high.\n\nAccording to the effect on youth employment that Mankiw has observed, it would appear that a higher minimum wage would serve to exacerbate this issue, so it is unclear exactly how these two policy recommendations are reconciled.\n\nMy economics professor wrote an [Op-Ed](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-sanderson-minimum-wage-20140921-story.html) detailing why he doesn't believe the minimum wage is an effective tool to combat poverty that is, in my opinion, sufficiently representative of many opponents of the minimum wage.\n\n&gt;Yet this advocacy raises some troubling questions, among them whether it's an appropriate government intervention in the free market.\n\n&gt;Businesses are under pressure not to unilaterally cut wages, because workers, like customers, have alternatives; they can quit if an employer isn't paying market rate and look for employment elsewhere. This very real threat keeps firms from reducing pay. Even without minimum wage laws, the interaction of supply and demand would conspire to keep wages about what they are today, based on workers' experience, productivity and discipline.\n\n&gt;There are more efficient, less intrusive, avenues to improve the economic lot of unskilled workers in this country.\n\n&gt;Why? If firms have so much market power, and they're looking to maximize profits, why does anyone make more than the legal minimum?\n\n&gt;But the chief argument against this new trend in cities and states of mandating a higher minimum wage is that it's not the best way to achieve the goal of pulling hardworking people out of poverty.\n\n&gt;In the short run there are more efficient, less intrusive avenues to improve the economic lot of unskilled workers in this country. Tweaks to the federal government's Earned Income Tax Credit program would be one way to put more money into the pockets of those who need it. Longer term, the goal should be to improve human capital prospects for those at the bottom of the economic ladder, ensuring that all people have opportunities to develop the skills and knowledge that will make them worth far more than the current wage rate or poverty standard. That would be a happy outcome not only for low-wage workers but for businesses, for families and for the larger economy.\n\nThere are many people on both sides of the argument, each with their own views on the topic. This also appears to be a primary difference in the policy prescriptions for poverty, so the debate has taken to a national stage. In [Paul Ryan's plan to combat poverty](http://abetterway.speaker.gov/_assets/pdf/ABetterWay-Poverty-PolicyPaper.pdf) he suggests increasing the Earned Income Tax Credit, as the excerpts from the Op-Ed mentioned.\n\n&gt;The Earned Income Tax Credit is another potential solution. The EITC is a refundable credit available to low-income workers with dependent children as well as certain low-income workers without children. It can help with the transition because it increases the financial rewards of work. Increasing the EITC would help smooth the glide path from welfare to work.\n\nWhich side of the debate is correct? Is a federal minimum wage of $15 the path towards the alleviation of poverty and lifting workers wages higher than the current minimum wage (described as a \"starvation wage\" by proponents of the policy within the Democratic Party)? Or are the opponents of the minimum wage correct who assert that it hurts low skilled workers, increases unemployment among the youth, hurts young people by creating perverse incentives for them to drop out before completing their high school education, and is an ineffective tool for combating poverty?    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n-----\n\n^1 Mankiw, N.

That's due to our tendency to move where there are like-minded individuals. This phenomenon has been referred to as \"the big sort.\"\n\nAs such, there has been an emerging \"two Americas\" phenomenon, where rural America and urban America have massive differences in general ideology, lifestyle, experiences, etc. http://www.economist.com/node/11581447\n\n&gt; Americans move house often, usually for practical reasons. Before choosing a new neighbourhood, they drive around it. They notice whether it has gun shops, evangelical churches and “W” bumper stickers, or yoga classes and organic fruit shops. Perhaps unconsciously, they are drawn to places where they expect to fit in.\n\n&gt; Where you live is partly determined by where you can afford to live, of course. But the “Big Sort” does not seem to be driven by economic factors. Income is a poor predictor of party preference in America; cultural factors matter more. For Americans who move to a new city, the choice is often not between a posh neighbourhood and a run-down one, but between several different neighbourhoods that are economically similar but culturally distinct.\n\n&gt; Because Americans are so mobile, even a mild preference for living with like-minded neighbours leads over time to severe segregation. An accountant in Texas, for example, can live anywhere she wants, so the liberal ones move to the funky bits of Austin while the more conservative ones prefer the exurbs of Dallas. Conservative Californians can find refuge in Orange County or the Central Valley.\n\nThis phenomenon has also been seen in our elections. Dems are increasingly seen as the party of college-educated urbanites, while the GOP is seen as the party of non-college educated rural voters. Looking at political maps, you can see that urban counties are heavily slanted to the Democrats, while rural counties go heavily Republican.\n\nSeeing how the two sides are diverging, is there a way to bring them together?" }

What would the future of the alt-right's role in the Republican Party look like if Trump were to lose?\n\n* Why has Trump turned to a media figure like Bannon to take on such a significant role in his campaign, rather than a more traditional political operative?  \n\n* What does this speech say about Hillary Clinton's strategy in the campaign?

If passed, the bill:\n\n&gt;reduces the number of exempt positions under Cooper's supervision from 1,500 to 300. Exempt positions are those that a governor can hire or fire at will, either because they are managers or because their job is somewhat political in nature. Although former Gov. Bev Perdue had roughly 500 such positions under her control, GOP lawmakers gave Gov. Pat McCrory 1,500 to work with.\n\n&gt;puts the Department of Public Instruction more firmly under the supervision of the superintendent of public instruction, a position elected separately from the governor.

According to the *Longman Grammar of Spoken and Written English*, adverbs are more common in spoken than written language; this scenario anecdotally bears out that rule, since most of Holt's language was originally written, not spoken extemporaneously.\n* Trump scored higher on tones of disgust, while Clinton scored higher on analytical language; Holt scored higher than either candidate on conscientiousness and lower on emotional range, both of which could be interpreted as desirable traits in an impartial moderator.\n\n#Questions\n\nWhat are your thoughts on these \"data?\" \n\nDo these results conform to your expectations? \n\nDoes anything else jump out at you? \n\nIs it even relevant?\n\n*ETA: unique word counts*\n\n*ETA 2: tone analysis*" }

Google Sheets can be slow so wait a few ticks until you can see the bottom tabs.  Each source is given its own tab, and the summary sheet is available as \"Results\".\n\n**THE RESULTS**\n\n.-.-*The Good*-.-.\n\nOn the prediction side, **FiveThirtyEight is king**.  Not just slightly king, but in literally every way.  Nate created two prediction tools, *Polls Plus* and *Polls Only*, and he recommends that you consider both as predictions rather than one being superior (they each outperform the other in different scenarios).  Either model by itself is superior to poll aggregation or TP/PW.  To put it into perspective, 50% of Nate's predictions are within 2.7% of the actual result.  **Nate has called 95% of the states within 5 points, decimating anything else.**\n\nOn the polling aggregation site, **HowWillAmericaVote** is a very finicky site, but when it has enough data to generate error bars (as it did for 14 states - IA, NH, NV, SC, GA, MA, OK, TX, VA, MI, FL, IL, NC, OH), **it outperforms raw polling averages** (RealClearPolitics).  The error rate was high (3/14 states were called in the wrong direction), but as delegates are awarded proportionally this matters far less than people think. It is very clear that it is *not* a prediction site.\n\n.-.-*The Interesting*-.-.\n\nPrediction/Betting Markets currently have the *mystique*, but I can find little evidence to suggest they are superior in any way.  Prediction markets existed for almost every state, so that would be the one advantage.  But the prediction markets failed 4/31 states, and man, if you had bought some Bernie shares at 0.91 cents for Michigan... Basically, I can't find any reason not to just look at 538 or the polls. \n\n.-.-*The Bad*-.-.\n\nThere's just no two ways about it.  *Whatever Tyler Pedigo is doing, it's not working.*  He is outperformed, in most cases, by simply looking at the average results of the most recent 3-5 polls.  5 of his 29 states were called, and though his claim to fame among Sanders supporters seems to be his correct call of Michigan, I'm providing no exaggeration when I state that this appears to be simply random chance.  His misses in Minnesota, Arizona, Massacheusetts, and Missouri were very bad (though Illinois goes down as a miss, he was closer than 538 on the wrong side of the call).  As in, worse than just plugging in the last poll result bad.\n\n\n**THE DISCUSSION**\n\nI plan on keeping this going, but I was very surprised to see the Betting Market performance be as poor as it is, given its reputation. As well, I hope many here find this resource useful as they navigate the online universe, where Nate Silver is used like a dirty word, the \"unpredictability of the race\" is bandied about without any real support (realclearpolitics did very well, and its a simple polling average), and new predictions come out.  Any other surprises or questions about the data?  Does anyone have any other sites they want me to plug in?  \n\nBy the way, Feel free to link or use the data I've created; please just provide credit to my reddit username.  \n\nTL;DR: http://i.imgur.com/EuMIRqs.png" }

{ "subreddit" : "politicaldiscussion", "title" : "Was the middle class just an anomaly of the 20th century, and, barring some sort of intervention, are we now simply retracting back to a society of upper and lower classes?", "text" : "Much of the rhetoric during this presidential campaign has centered around issues facing the middle class: \"wages are stagnant\", \"unionization is down\", \"middle-class jobs have disappeared\" etc.\n\nBut the more I ponder these questions and look back to history, the less evidence I see that the middle class is a normal, sustainable concept. The middle can only exist with significant intervention, regulation, and controls. When we look at societies in previous centuries, there was hardly a middle class. There was the proletariat, the petit-bourgeoisie, and the bourgeoisie; of course there are probably exceptions to that, which I'm sure someone will cite, but when I think of societies past, I just think of peasants and kings, not much else in between. Fast forward to the 21st century, and Modern America is much more complex than previous societies: we have an underclass, working class, lower-middle-class, middle-class, upper-middle-class, and upper class, all of which have distinct cultures, tastes, and preferences in addition to differing amounts of social, financial, and cultural capital which can wield vastly superior opportunities depending on how much you accumulate. Overall, the concept of a middle-class seems nascent when placed in the context of thousands of years of human society.\n\nAs I watch this election cycle, it becomes obvious that the middle-class in America only came to exist because of a sequence of fortuitous events throughout the 20th century (industrial revolution, WWII, unionization, New Deal, etc.). I think what's happened over the last few decades is that the middle and lower classes exhausted all of their low-hanging fruit, and the remaining opportunities available are either at the top or the bottom. To elaborate, I don't think the cause of the decline of the middle class can solely be blamed on the deregulation of the 80s, as most people claim; rather, I think the decline in the middle class is driven more so by a polarization of the skills demanded in the labor market due to automation and outsourcing:\n\n- There has been an increase in high-skill-high-paying jobs (which are hard to automate and difficult to outsource)\n- There has also been an increase in low-skill-low-paying jobs (which employers could likely automate but choose not to automate since the cost of labor &lt; cost of capital, *for now*)\n- AND, most importantly, there has been a steady decrease in good-paying-middle/low-skill jobs due to automation (which was inevitable) and/or outsourcing (which could potentially make fiscal sense, from the company's perspective).\n\nAlso, I don't think the drop in unionization is the cause of a decline in middle class either; rather, the decline in overall unionization is simply *an effect* of their jobs disappearing. Unions can help sustain a middle class, but only if the jobs that the union represents are there to begin with. Unionization declined because the rug was ripped out from under their feet, and there wasn't much they could do about it. It's not like they can stop a company from leaving the country. They can only protect you once you *get* the job. If there's no job to begin with, then you're in a bad spot.\n\nIt seems that the only real solution to revive the middle class is to implement some form of wealth redistribution, or the introduction of more good-paying-low/middle-skill jobs. The problem is that I don't think those types of jobs are ever coming back, and even if they did they would largely be automated. Furthermore, the developed countries that do have a middle class (think Western/Northern Europe) have significant wealth redistribution through high rates of taxation. But our history is so largely rooted in disdain for taxation, that Americans are consequently quite hesitant to the notion of wealth redistribution.\n\nI guess my concern is that, barring some sort of large-scale intervention, the middle class will continue to decline while the upper-middle class and upper class will continue edge them out, while the lower class will remain stagnant or even increase.\n\n**TLDR: It seems to me that the middle-class had a good run and now we're reverting back to a less equal, more elitist society.**" }

At the same time, it has allowed disenfranchisement to move beyond that black population — which makes up 38 percent of those denied the vote — into the body politic as a whole. One lesson here is that punishments designed for one pariah group can be easily expanded to include others as well.\n\n&gt;The history of disenfranchisement was laid out in a fascinating 2003 study by Angela Behrens, Christopher Uggen and Jeff Manza.

Look at Ron Paul and Gary Johnson (a former Republican), two libertarian darlings who are probably some of the most successful libertarians in modern American politics. Or the Koch brothers, two self-identified libertarians who generally endorse and back Republicans with their vast sums of money. I mean, I can understand the appeal of the Republican Party to libertarians on one hand: they're generally very anti-regulation, pro-business, and at least pay lip service to fiscal conservatism. But on the other hand, the party is incredibly socially conservative; some would argue that is reactionary, repressive, and even far right.\n\nMy question (to self-identified libertarians, if possible) is thus this: why do libertarians prioritize fiscal and economic conservatism by voting for/supporting Republicans instead of prioritizing social liberalism by voting for/supporting Democrats? What makes a libertarian put \"economic liberty\" before \"social liberty,\" outside immediate self-interest (obviously a business owner might reap more benefit from economic freedoms than personal ones)?\n\nI'm not trying to say that prioritizing one more than other is necessarily bad, either; I'm just asking how this prioritizing occurs and for what reason." }

Yet we saw no such thing. In fact, we saw the opposite. Trump didn't seem to have any effect on most GOP house candidates, but Clinton was a massive anchor on a lot of Dems. Luckily for Dems, most of their candidates barely held on, but we see in areas where Trump did way better than normal Republicans, GOP congressional candidates also did better, while the reverse was not true..\n\n\nHere's some examples:\n\nIn Minnesota, Democrat Tim Walz was in a seat Obama won 50-48. He faced basically a political nobody, and neither party invested in his seat, which both sides thought to be safe. Instead, Trump won his district by 15, and he barely managed to hold on in  the 3rd closest house race in the entire country. Conservative Democrat Collin Peterson also was re-elected in the closest margin of his career, when Trump won his district by 30. Democrat Rick Nolan barely managed to  hold on in the 2nd closest house race in the country in his historically Democratic seat that Trump won by 15.\n\nIn New Hampshire, Democrat Anne Kuster was thought to be safe and neither party invested in her seat. But Trump did way better than Romney and McCain in her district and she barely won re-election\n\nOther Democrats in Trumpy districts like Dave Loebsack and Matt Cartwright had the closest re-elections of their careers. Meanwhile, Republicans in Trumpy districts thought to be in danger like Rod Blum in Iowa, Bruce Poliquin in Maine, John Faso and Claudia Tenney in upstate New York, Jack Bergmann in Michigan and Brian Mast in Florida all won re-election easily. None of those races were even close, and Trump likely had a lot to do with that.\n\nOn the flipside, Trump barely seems to have hurt GOP candidates in districts where he did terribly, at all. Barbara Comstock's district in Virginia swung from 51-49 Romney to 52-42 Clinton, and Democrats poured millions into that house race, but Comstock was re-elected by 5%.\n\nTrump lost Carlos Curbelo's district in Florida 57-41, and Democrats heavily contested his seat. Curbelo was re-elected very easily, by 12%.\n\nMike Coffman's district in Colorado swung signficantly to the left as Clinton won it by 9%, but Coffman was re-elected by 9%.\n\nMartha McSally won a razor thin victory in 2014 in Arizona and her district swung heavily away from Trump going from 50-48 Romney to 50-45 Clinton while Democrats contested her seat, but McSally won easily by 14%.\n\nPerhaps the biggest example of this is in California. California has a whopping 53 house seats, and Trump did the worst there of any candidate from either party since 1936, yet the GOP lost a grand total of zero house seats in California. Darrell Issa may actually have been hurt by Trump, as he barely won re-election in the closest race of his career, but no one else seems to have been hurt by him. Steve Knight was thought to be dead in the water in a district that went from 50-48 Romney to 50-44 Clinton, but he easily won re-election by 8%. Trump lost David Valadao's district by a whopping 55-40 margin but Valadao was re-elected easily 58-42. Trump managed to lose the districts of Orange County Republicans Ed Royce, Mimi Walters and Dana Rohrbacher by 8, 5 and 2 points respectively, but all 3 won easily re-elections with respective margins of 15, 18 and 17 points. Trump got crushed 52-41 in Democrat Ami Bera's  suburban Sacramento district, a swing district with a former PVI of EVEN, but Bera barely held on to win re-election by 2%.\n\nThere are more and more examples, Erik Paulsen in Minnesota, Tom Price in Georgia, many Republicans in Texas, all were in very anti-Trump districts and won easily\n\nWhy did Republicans in anti-Trump districts do so much better than Democrats in anti-Clinton districts?" }

About $175 million will be directed toward the FBI’s counterterrorism efforts and $15 million for active shooter training. \nSenate Democrats argue that their new funding plan would better equip the FBI with critical resources as the agency investigates terror threats. Under the Democrats’ proposal, the FBI can restore more than 350 counterterrorism positions, including more than 225 special agents.\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Separately, Nelson unveiled legislation that would list any person who has been investigated for terrorist ties — even if the probe is no longer active — in the National Instant Criminal Background Check system. If someone who has been investigated in the past tries to buy a firearm, the Nelson bill would require the NICS to automatically ping the FBI.\n\n\n**From Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.):**\n\n&gt;It’s okay with me to stop a gun purchase, at least temporarily, if you’re on the terrorist watch list as long as the person has the right to challenge that. What I’m not going to do is let that be the issue. The issue is inadequate funding for the FBI and laws that don’t work. So let’s have a package. Let’s replace sequestration, take it off the table for the FBI. … Let’s have a robust, healthy debate about funding.\n\n**From Bill Nelson (D-FL):**\n\n&gt;We’re not saying: don’t sell guns to someone just because they were investigated. But having a system in place that alerts the FBI if someone they once investigated is suddenly trying to purchase multiple assault weapons is just common sense.\n\nWhat do you expect to happen with these proposals? What do you think of them?

The NRA's position on this issue has not changed. The NRA believes that terrorists should not be allowed to purchase or possess firearms, period. Anyone on a terror watchlist who tries to buy a gun should be thoroughly investigated by the FBI and the sale delayed while the investigation is ongoing. If an investigation uncovers evidence of terrorist activity or involvement, the government should be allowed to immediately go to court, block the sale, and arrest the terrorist. At the same time, due process protections should be put in place that allow law-abiding Americans who are wrongly put on a watchlist to be removed. That has been the position of Sen. John Cornyn (R.-Tex.) and a majority of the U.S. Senate. Sadly, President Obama and his allies would prefer to play politics with this issue.\n\nDo you think this changes the dynamics and outcome?

For Spencer, \"race realism\" and ethnic nationalism are the defining features of the alt right: \n\n&gt;Richard Spencer, who coined the term “alt-right” in 2008, says he intended the term to describe a diverse, heterodox group whose members were “deeply alienated, intellectually, even emotionally and spiritually, from American conservatism”.\nThey were disillusioned at the end of the Bush presidency by Republican policies on war and immigration. They sought to draw on currents like the European New Right to transform what they saw as a moribund conservative movement. He and others connected with the succession of websites he edited – such as Taki magazine and alternativeright.com – wrote extensively, focusing the alt-right into a more definite ideology, with increasingly hardline ideas about race. \nSpencer says that the term is still flexible, but affiliation has some minimum requirements. “Someone who is really alt-right recognises the reality of race, and the fact that race matters, and that race is an essential component of identity.”\n\n\nIs this part of a larger trend in American politics, or is 2016 a unique and isolated phenomenon?

This is currently the only Oregon poll for the Democratic Primary that is in the RealClearPolitics database.\n\nI was pretty surprised when I saw these numbers. Oregon has a large white population and it's considered a fairly liberal state, which caused FiveThirtyEight to identify it way back in July as one of the most [demographically friendly states](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/bernie-sanders-could-win-iowa-and-new-hampshire-then-lose-everywhere-else/) for Bernie.  \n\nNotably, despite being 15 points ahead, Hillary is still below 50% support in the poll and there are a large number of undecided voters. The poll also tested a \"high turnout\" scenario which showed Hillary with a still solid 7 point lead.\n\nWhile Oregon is a closed primary, which is expected to hurt Bernie, Hillary winning the state by 15 points would be pretty surprising to me. Personally, I'm of the opinion that the poll is a fluke and am still expecting Bernie to edge out Hillary in the state (or at least for it to be very close), but I would love to hear what others think of the poll especially from people familiar with the state, which I am not." }

It's of course necessary to remember these are benchmarks not predictions for the primaries. \n\nUseful info from this update:\n\n* Sanders is benchmarked to require wins in 19 of the remaining 22 contests, losing only MD, DE, and DC. \n\n* He will need 56.5% of the remaining delegates (down from 58% last week).\n\n* Upcoming states of Wisconsin and New York are required to go +16 and +4 respectively to keep pace.\n\nThese numbers would be to reach a even delegate count with Clinton.

The issue is that there aren't really any red-state Democrats up for election, but there are a host of blue and purple state Republican governors who will either be term-limited or up for reelection.\n\nTerm-limited:\nNew Jersey (Chris Christie),\nFlorida (Rick Scott),\nMaine (Paul LePage),\nMichigan (Rick Snyder),\nNevada (Brian Sandoval),\nNew Mexico (Susana Martinez),\nOhio (John Kasich)\n\nThere are also a lot of governors who aren't term-limited, but could lose given the fundamentals of their state if popular opinion turns against Trump:\n\nIllinois (Bruce Rauner),\nMaryland (Larry Hogan),\nMassachusetts (Charlie Baker),\nNew Hampshire (Chris Sununu),\nVermont (Phil Scott),\nWisconsin (Scott Walker)\n\nBaker in Massachusetts and Hogan in Maryland are two of the most popular governors in the country, so those mansions may not be winnable. But Rauner is very unpopular, Phil Scott is new, and Walker is controversial.\n\nThere's also the possibility that Dan Malloy could lose in Connecticut, as he is very unpopular, which would offset a Republican loss.\n\nI assume Dems would be the favorites in New Jersey, Maine, Illinois, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, New Hampshire, and Vermont unless Trump manages to be surprisingly popular.

He eventually ended up in Williamsburg, MA at some point in the early 1700's. He was all about America after he moved here. He named his son George Washington Maupin and was considered a huge patriot. In Willimsburg he opened up The Market Square Tavern and ran it during the entirety of the Revolutionary War. Not a small feat in itself. It's been said that he repaired arms for the patriot army &amp; I've been told that his tavern was a meeting place during the war for high ranking patriot army officials.

There are three primate groups that you can encounter and observe in Africa – monkeys, apes and humans. We all have complex brains, excellent eyesight, the ability to walk upright and skillful opposable thumbs, and the interesting part is that this is only where our similarities begin! \n\nInteresting facts about baboons, bush babies (galagos) and vervet monkeys,plus best places to observe them in their natural habitat, here:\nhttps://www.bookallsafaris.com/news/african-safari-primates-habitat\n\nThe Mountain Gorilla\n\nOnly two primate species build sleeping platforms on the ground – humans and gorillas. Yet the world’s largest primate struggles for survival in the last protected patches of African rainforests – thanks to deforestation.\nHumans and apes share about 98% of their genetic material. That’s unbelievably close. Ignore the fur, and you’ll begin to the similarities. Although chimps are considered are closest relatives, gorillas might resemble us more. Mountain gorillas are primarily terrestrial and their feet are adapted for walking, not to mention that their facial expressions are worth a thousand words.\nGorillas display an advanced communication system that uses complex facial expressions, smell and touch. Just like we humans give reassurance and comfort by patting each other’s backs, so do gorillas. A highly endangered species, less than 1,000 mountain gorillas live today, spread in four national parks.\n\nFind best places to see mountain gorillas here: https://www.bookallsafaris.com/news/african-safari-primates-habitat\n\nThe Chimpanzee\n\nCurious, hairy, noisy and highly intelligent, chimpanzees spend their days in trees as well as on land in most East African forests.\nUnlike other apes and monkeys, chimps are individualistic. They do however form large communities of up to 100 souls sharing one territory. With forward-facing eyes, flat face, small nose and the same number and type of teeth as humans, we have a lot more in common. Chimps observe and learn, take care of orphaned children, show compassion (http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2917009/Chimps-kind-Primates-learn-compassionate-behaviour-just-like-humans.html) and even laugh. They defend themselves from predators like lions and leopards by throwing large sticks and branches at them. Plus, they build tools to obtain food. They use stones to crack nuts, sticks to dig for insects, and they sharpen their tools, all while displaying exceptional hand dexterity. They teach their young how to use tools and correct their errors. Therefore, it’s safe to say apes have a culture (http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110817/full/476266a.html).\n\nWhat other interesting facts about our tree-dwelling relatives do you know?" }

Most people tend not to secure the things they need to live or prioritise things like getting food without making any preparations for covering their other basic needs. Think of the people when a disaster hits that you see in the news stocking up on food panic buying, but most of them will have little in the way of water or when they do they buy vastly to little of it to support themselves, let alone their families \n\n&gt; http://news2.onlinenigeria.com/world/263678-panic-buying-in-cyprus-ahead-of-deadline-to-seal-eu-bailout-as-wealthy-savers-face-losing-fifth-of-money.html\n\n&gt; http://time.com/money/3682510/blizzard-panic-shopping-groceries/\n\n&gt; Above: A good example of panic buying after concerns about lack of basic supplies being available, yet you look at a lot of what people are buying and see that a lot of pointless items being picked up and little thought towards possible problems. The second example being that people securing their food need but not considering the 'what if' their mains supply of water cuts off. \n\n&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_needs\n\n&gt; http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-americans-underestimate-personal-water-usage-study-says-20140227-story.html\n\n&gt; http://modernsurvivalblog.com/preps/the-average-gallons-of-water-people-consume-each-day/\n\n&gt; Obviously what you need will depend on a specific set of circumstances of the event you are talking about having happened. As your question is non specific the best course of action is hard to say because for example your country goes into a state of war in the area you live in, then getting away from that is going to be one of your main concerns. However a global event like a global pandemic, your immediate needs will be to cover your basic needs and getting away from possible lines of infection and how to do that will depend on the route of infection eg person borne may be better to stay where you are and seclude yourself away, water borne may be best to get away from bodies of water or secure a location where you can get fresh uncontaminated water safely and to a new location should that end up contaminated and similar actions for airborne. \n\n&gt; In the case of world war 2, survival rates of people living in urban areas like London was much lower compared to those in rural areas, the main reason for this is that bombing a place where all the places people might be and that a bomb is pretty likely to hit something with a person inside. Where you get to the rural areas, bombing is pretty much empty space and a few odd houses. It's the advantage of indiscriminate bombing campaigns that it didn't really matter what you hit so long as you hit something that makes these campaigns successful. \n\n&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom\n\n&gt; One thing people forget is that just because you've secured a source of a basic need that you should still be constantly looking for an alternative source to secure that need or saving up what you have to secure your long term future. To demonstrate this you only need to look at normal daily life, which is just a glorified fight for survival in a way that people accept as the norm. You see that studies show that some people are very poor at budgeting with money (a resource) to secure their basic needs and long term survival in terms of savings for when they have a change to their use or availability of resources.\n\n&gt; http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/09/michael-gove-right-some-poor-families-do-budget-badly-its-not-their-fault\n\n&gt; https://www.thinkmoney.co.uk/news-advice/is-poor-budgeting-preventing-people-from-saving-0-4248-0.htm\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n---\n\n####*(Score: 38)* [**TMAF about Nine Inch Nails**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TellMeAFact/comments/4saw3n/tmaf_about_nine_inch_nails/) *by /u/Aiviish*\n\n---\n##### [Comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/TellMeAFact/comments/4saw3n/tmaf_about_nine_inch_nails/d58bbru) by /u/ffatty with a score of 20:\n\n&gt; In the the music video for _Down In It_, frontman Trent Reznor falls off of a building and dies.
