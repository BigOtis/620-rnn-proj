He remembered Norman junior used to be obsessed with Pokemon in his younger years, and now that it was making a comeback, he decided to see what all the fuss was about.\n\nHe created his character, naming it Norman1970, because \"Norman\" was already taken. \"Boy, there sure are a lot of Norman's in the world,\" he said to Norman, scratching him behind the ears. He chose his \"monster,\" he thought the blue little turtle looked cute\n\n\"Now what?\" Norman thought to himself. Nothing was happening.\n\nHe thought maybe Norman Jr would know. He texted him, \"Hi Norman! I just got that new Pokeman app. Have you got it yet?\"\n\nAlmost immediately he received a reply, excitedly, Norman checked his phone. \"Hey dad, yeah it's great! And it's Pokemon\"\n\nConfused by the last sentence, but ignoring it, Norman replied, \"yeah it is fun. Is there a way for me to be friends with you on it?\"\n\n\"No, not yet.\"\n\nDisappointed, Norman replied, \"Okay, we'll have fun. Don't forget to play your turn on Words with Friends!\"\n\nNorman didn't receive a reply, \"he must be busy playing that new Pokeman game,\" thought Norman. He opened up the app again, but still didn't understand what to do and couldn't find any instructions. Sighing, Norman laid down his phone and turned on an old episode of CSI. About 30 minutes in, his phone buzzed with a notification that Norman Jr had played a word." }

He cooked balsamic-glazed salmon fillets, a quick yet impressive recipe he learned a few weeks ago from a book he found on the floor of the university library.\n\nIt went over *very* well– The fish, not the book.

He noticed his cell phone glowing as it sat charging on his dresser.\n\nConfused and perturbed, Norman got out of bed and walked across the bedroom to check why his phone had made this noise. As he stumbled towards his phone, he considered using the outlet next to his bedside table in the future. \n\nWhen Norman got to his phone, he saw that he had a text message notification. Norman was surprised, because he never gets text messages.

Do they know I have to wake up in 4 hours?\", Norman asked Norman, who sat squinty eyed on his cat perch in the corner. \n\nCuriously, and somewhat nervously, he opened the text message. \n\n\"AMBER ALERT - Plate HHG-5509 (PA), White Toyota Camry, 4 Door\"\n\nNorman's heart sank, and he felt extreme guilt for questioning the urgency of the text message. Now Norman was wide awake. He began considering his options. He tried to recall CSI episodes of kidnappings. After 5 minutes of consideration, Norman realized he didn't have a enough information to do anything. He laid back in bed and repeated the license plate number in his head so that he could be on the lookout tomorrow. \n\nNorman didn't get any more sleep that night.\n\nHe got out of bed 4 hours later to get ready for work. On his way to work, Norman noticed 5 different white 4-door cars, but didn't believe any to be a Toyota Camry. \n\nFeeling somewhat disappointed in himself, Norman sat at his computer and opened his web browser, whose homepage is set to the local news station. He read the headline, \"Missing girl found\". Norman was very relieved, and felt a huge weight off his shoulders. He smiled and thought about how great this day had started." }

{ "subreddit" : "lifeofnorman", "title" : "The Book of Norman- The Time Has(almost) Finally Come/The Writers Who Made the Final Cut", "text" : "(If you're interested in hearing some of the progress on the book over the last number of months, feel free to read this overly long speech. If you're here to see who made the cut, and why others did not, skip to the last two paragraphs.)\n\nHello all! After a long, long while, I'm here with another update. Unfortunately I stated that there was a final update, and that no other update would come after it, which somewhat made me a recluse when it came to sharing information. Most of my info let out was through people specifically asking me, \"What the hell are you doing with the book, Cameron!?\", and I realize that isn't fair that I made you all have to reach out to me to find out that info. Anyways, I have some news.\n\nThe book is finished. Finito. Completo. Donno. Sort of. The innards, all the stories, and all the edits, which there were many, are complete. Frankly, I've had enough stories included in the book since February; that being 365. However, things change. The tone of the book has shifted a lot since the conception of the project, and because of that, stories I collected at the beginning no longer lined up with the thought process I had near the end.\n\nSo more stories were collected. Newer, fresher, more in line with what I had in mind. Then, the book shifts again, and I realize there's only so many stories you can have of Norman missing the bus and getting caught in the rain. So I scrapped some repetition.\n\nSo more stories were collected. Now, people are starting to write plotlines on the subreddit! Lisa is born! Frank's a drunk! Norman gets some confidence! Ideas that were non-existent start to pop up. \"I wish I thought of that earlier\" turns into \"Damn, I can't *not* put this in the book.\" So more stories are cut, and more are added. Variety. Levels of skill in writers advance. Some people just disappear and I can't make edits to their story, forcing me to cut. \n\nSo more stories were collected. Now, it's just the best of the crop. Months after finishing, I'll find some damn good stories, better than anything already included. More is cut. More is added. More is cut, yadda yadda.\n\nThen I realized, this will never stop. So long as the subreddit exists, there will be more stories, better stories, than anything written thus far. It evolves. No matter how many rounds of edits I do, re-reading the exact same story two dozen times, there will undoubtedly be typos. I hope not, I did my best, but there will always be grammatical slips, like finding grains of sand in your shoe years later. \n\nSo now, the book is done. It's reached a point where I can be proud of what its become, something that I hope you'll all enjoy. The thing that let's me know it's good, is when I re-read a story, one I've read dozens of times, and known the punchline for a year, but still manage to crack a smile, or even feel a punch in the gut from. It's littered with remarkable talent, fun stories, cute illustrations, and the fine line of boring yet undeniably charming that Norman always had.\n\nThis is not the end, and I realize I should stop praising the final product before it even exists. Hell, the whole point of this post here was for one purpose- to show which writers made the cut. I feel that I should post it well ahead of time, since, as this post has hopefully made clear, I had to cut a lot of stories. I felt bad about it. After a while, I had to move the names of the writers away from the stories and number them instead, since some people were so sincere and heartfelt with me, that I just felt horrible removing their stories after I told them it'd be included. If you didn't make the list, know that I am sorry, that it was nothing personal, and it wasn't always because it was better or worse than what made the book. There was a bigger picture involved. Sometimes a fantastic story delves too far from the books set canon, and creates inconsistency with a dozen other stories. Sometimes there will be a story similar to three other stories, but only one of them hits the notes needed for that part of the book. Sometimes, people don't respond to me, and I didn't feel comfortable publishing an altered story. Things get cut.\n\nBut it was all for the best; to make this book to be in the best shape it can be, without strings attached. And so, without further ado, here's the list. To those of you included, you'll be receiving a PM shortly. Basically, I'll give you one last chance to see what your story is, if you're interested, and make sure that if I made any changes that you're not fine with, that you can have this last chance to pull out or work it out with me. \n\n- /u/samuel2097\n- /u/renanFerrari\n- /u/Marine2014\n- /u/Xezer\n- /u/BatmanHimself\n\n- /u/RamsesThePigeon\n- /u/RUBY_FELL\n- /u/alien6\n- /u/Case_A\n-

Odd, since he’d gotten his usual eight hours of sleep, and had drunk the same warm cup of coffee with cream that he always drank.

Norman did not want to consider the ramifications of such a thought, and though he feared making a scene, the urge to yawn was creeping slowly but steadily through his body.\n\nThen a strange and new thought occurred to Norman. He realized that he really WASN’T engaged in the presentation. He WAS rather bored by his manager today. Perhaps, Norman thought, I AM willing to shake things up a little, and give a good yawn. Nothing big, nothing flashy, just a nice, satisfying yawn.\n\nAs Norman considered it, he liked the idea more and more. He sat up and prepared himself for his act of rebellion.

As usual, Norman didn't have any weekend plans so he thought maybe he would stop for dinner after work tomorrow. He'd never been to an all-you-can-eat buffet before. \n\nThe next day at work, Norman spent his lunch break looking at the website for the restaurant. There was a list of all the foods included on the buffet and Norman carefully wrote down exactly what foods he wanted to get on each trip. He planned on pacing himself so he didn't get too stuffed and tired. He had two episodes of CSI recorded that he planned on watching when he got home. \n\nFinally, it was time! Norman got in his car and drove to the restaurant. He arrived at 5:15, and as it was still early in the evening, he was seated immediately. A young blonde waitress arrived to take his order. She let him know that the special that night was the all-you-can-eat buffet and that it was $14.99. Norman ordered an Arnold Palmer to drink since it was the weekend and told the  waitress he would have the buffet. She smiled and told him to go ahead and grab a plate from the stack and enjoy his dinner. \n\nHe shuffled up to the buffet line and grabbed a plate. He consulted the note in his pocket detailing what food items to get. His first course was to be a salad. He piled on a small mound of iceberg lettuce, some cheddar cheese, and tomatoes. In another corner he added a small scoop of cole slaw. He wanted ranch dressing but he didn't see any and didn't want to be a bother, so he ladled on French instead. He found a cup for soup and poured himself a small bowl of chicken noodle. That would do for the first round. Nothing too filling right away. He made his way back to the table and sipped his beverage and began eating. \n\nNorman polished off the salad and cole slaw before eating the soup. He realized he had erred when his soup was just luke warm, but reasoned that he could always grab more on another trip. \n\nThe smiling blonde waitress stopped by to ask how everything was and ask if she could take his plate out of the way. Norman froze. His eyes darted around at the other tables, but there weren't many to look at. As this was his first trip to an all-you-can-eat buffet, he wasn't sure if he was supposed to use the same plate or get a new one. He replied that he wasn't quite finished and that he would keep his plate for now. The waitress left the table. \n\nNobody close by was having the buffet. Norman didn't want to look silly and do the wrong thing with his plate. He sipped his Arnold Palmer slowly. The waitress stopped by a few minutes later and asked if Norman was doing okay. He asked for the check. \n\nHe paid his $18 tab and left an even 15% tip. He got in the car and drove home, his stomach rumbling. He didn't even like French dressing. " }

So Norman quickly ran in the house, opened a can of Fancy Feast and set it down on the ground.

His pants were wrinkled, his hair disheveled, he'd forgotten his lunch and when he walked in, all eyes would be on him. \n\nAt 9:09, he pulled into the parking lot and was surprised, then relieved to see there were no cars. \"It's Saturday,\" he thought to himself. \"Not late at all.

Lisa commented on how plush the couch was, she enjoyed that when she sat on it, she sunk right in. Norman slid even closer to Lisa, now sitting right next to her. He put his head on her lap, and she began to slowly stroke his hair. Norman was getting quite excited, he really enjoyed Lisa's touch. It was about that time that Norman walked around the corner into the living room, holding the pig documentary DVD, and saw Norman sitting on Lisa's lap, purring. Lisa took the DVD, thanked Norman and Norman, and went on her way. Norman popped his meatloaf meal in the microwave, and settled in on the couch with Norman just in time to watch CSI. " }

Before this dream came to fruition, however, he noticed that, while the address was correct, the name on the envelope was actually Lisa's. He chuckled to himself. Yet another company newsletter had swapped their addresses, despite the complaints they had both filed. (Complaint was a strong word, Norman mused.

He bent over to stick the letter in the mail slot when an unusual thing happened- the letter wouldn't fit! It made sense to Norman, because the envelope truly was large, and perhaps the mail slot was on the small side as well. He had come all this way, however, and wasn't going to give up. He struggled with the sizing issue for a few seconds before the overstuffed A4 envelope reluctantly gave in. Norman was pleased with himself, and hoped that the contents were not too bent when Lisa opened them.\n\n\"Sorry I'm late,\" Norman told Norman as he walked through the door. Indeed, he was a good five minutes later than he had previously anticipated, and feline Norman was sitting by his food bowl impatiently. \n\n\"The letter didn't fit in the mail slot, so...\" At that very moment, he realized the perfect opportunity for a joke.

{ "subreddit" : "lifeofnorman", "title" : "Norman Encounters his High School Band", "text" : "It was late in the evening, Norman decided to head out to The Pub for a bite to eat. Sure, they had good beers available, but Norman wasn't a big beer drinker. He was a bigger fan of their dish, “Mount Nachos.”\n\nAs Norman sat at a bar-stool, happily eating his nachos, a band was starting to set up their instruments on the small stage in The Pub. The band members were all older men, somewhere in their forties, and each grunted and groaned excessively as they positioned their drum set, electric guitar, and bass guitar. Then a realization came over Norman.\n\nThis was his band from high-school.\n\nIt had been many decades, but Norman still remembered the band very clearly. Norman and the three men setting up on stage started a band in the 11th grade, called The Dusty Knucklers, and their specialty was hard rock. First there was Roger, the bass player. Back in the 80's, Roger was a heavy rocker, took style cues from David Bowie, and had a soft spot for Matilda, the bands muse. Norman had wondered where Matilda ended up after high-school. He had also wondered where Roger ended up as well- but it was answered for him this very night. Roger's hairline, as well as Tyler and Deacons, had fared well. The show began to start.\n\"Hello everyone, thanks for coming tonight!\" started Roger. He wiped the sweat from his forehead to slick back his long hair. Norman slicked back his hair as well, and wiped the excess sweat from his hand onto his pant-leg. \"We're the Wet Knucklers, and we hope you all have a good night. Party hard.\"\n\nThe old band started to play their songs; songs that Norman recognized well. The difference in the songs however, was the lack of Norman's keyboard. Norman wondered if he would still remember how to play a keyboard as well as he did then. It had been so many years…\n\nAfter an hour of playing, The Wet Knucklers put down their instruments and headed for the bar. Norman's heart began to pound intensely. *Would they recognize their old friend?*\n\nThe three men took a seat beside Norman. Norman's plate was clean. The band ordered a few beers.\n\"You guys did great tonight!\" cheered the bartender. As a bonus, he lined up shots for them.\n\nTyler smiled. \"Thanks mate. Always appreciate the compliments.\"\n\n\"So,\" started the bartender, \"You play hard rock, but no one on the keyboard? Seems like a missed opportunity.\"\n\n\"We used to have an keyboard player,\" said Roger, solemnly, \"back when we started the band. But we vowed to never have another one again. Not after Norman.\"\n\nNorman's heart sank. *Did they really not like me?*\n\n\"Why not? Did the guy just suck?\"\n\nRoger gulped down his beer, shaking his head as he swallowed. \"Not at all. He was a great player. But one day he left the band and... well... he died.\"\n\n\"How did he die, if you mind me asking?\"\n\n\"We heard it was from a heart attack. That happened about a year out of high school... I don't know, mate. It just doesn't feel right to replace him; you know?\"\n\n\"I understand.\" said the bartender sympathetically. \"Here- let me get you another round of shots.\"\n\nThe bartender poured another row of shots for the band. Everyone was silent- including Norman. Who said he was dead? Did no one look into it? Did everyone from his childhood assume he died?\n\n\"For Norman.\" said Tyler.\n\n\"For Norman.\" said Deacon.\n\n\"For Norman.\" said Roger.\n\nNorman wanted to say something- anything- but he couldn't find it in him. A tightness in his chest stopped him from being able to say a word. He hoped they might recognize him, that they would do him the favor of starting the conversation, but he knew it was hopeless. He looked like a completely different person since high school. He looked like his father. As the band went back up to play a second set, Norman paid his bill and left.\n\nNorman went home, humming the band's old songs.\n" }

He thought that this only happens in movies! He knew what this girl is!\n\n\"N-n-no thank you mam, I gotta head to work\" he responded as he  quickly walked toward the other subway station.

{ "subreddit" : "lifeofnorman", "title" : "Norman joins a protest", "text" : "When Norman bought socks he bought black socks. He bought black socks because all of his other socks were black. He did not enjoy pairing things up - life was much easier when all of his socks were aesthetically apathetic.\n\nBut it wasn't just the colour. They had to be of the same brand: \"Filmores Black Socks\". And they had to be cotton-rich. He imagined the Kings of England wearing them in bed, swivelling their heels and soles together in shear delight.\n\nNorman estimated that his socks' useful life stretched across about two years. Their relatively short life-span was the price to be paid for luxury. He had calculated that his socks of 2014 would soon be reaching their expiry date and so he had made an appointment with the menswear department.\n\nA lot had happened in two years. Now, the elasticated landscape spanned shelves ranging from hiking socks to a grotesque hybrid of sock and slipper. Norman carefully negotiated his way to the 'no-nonsense' section. He examined the rank and file of black socks and finger-walked his way to 'Filmores'.\n\nExcept they weren't 'Filmores'. They were a sock species called 'Flagmores. Norman closed his eyes and squeezed a bunch. No, they were not the same. They were not Filmores. There were no Filmores.\n\nWithout thinking, he took one of the impostors in hand and made his way to the checkout. He rationalised: he wasn't complaining, he was merely asking. He was going to place the Flagmores on the counter and say \"Sorry to be a nuisance but I was hoping you could tell me where I can find a pair of Filmores.\" Perfectly reasonable. Perhaps putting them on the counter might seem a little combative, like throwing down the sock gauntlet. No, he was only asking: the Flagmores were for reference; they weren't a weapon.\n\nHe arrived at a queue and clipped himself in at the back. He wondered whether he could buy Filmores from the internet but that didn't feel right. \n\nThe counter was only two arm's length away now. Only one customer stood between him and his question, an older woman wearing a silk kerchief around her neck. He craned over her shoulder and saw that she was buying a pair of Flagmores. The cashier looked pained. Silkerchief picked up the Flagmores and waggled them in the air like an eagle its prey.\n\n\"I've been coming to this store for over twenty years and you try and pass these off as the real thing?\"\n\nThe cashier grimaced, \"I'm sorry madam.”\n\nSilkerchief leaned in “I don’t think you understand. I came into town especially to buy Filmores. These,”  - she let the socks dribble off her hands onto the counter - “are  of an inferior quality. I daren’t use the term knock-off in an establishment such as this but these” - and this she whispered - “are second-rate.\"\n\nThe cashier stood unblinking as his hands found the phone, \"I will speak to the manager.\"\n\nSilkerchief crossed her arms: \"O.K.\" She turned around and, seeing Norman's Flagmores, raised her eyes to the heavens.\n\nThe cashier delivered a strangled mutter into the handset as Norman tucked the socks under his armpit. \"The manager will be with us shortly he flat-smiled.\" The cashier motioned to Norman. \n\nThe complainant took a staccato step to the side and Norman fell into place. He looked to the cashier then back at Silkerchief. He felt the Flagmores swell in his armpit. \n\n“Can I help you sir?” asked the cashier.\n\n“Uh,” Norman enunciated carefully.\n\n“Do you need a bag for them?” the cashier pointed at the swelling.\n\n“Uh.” Norman whisper-shouted. \"I’ve forgotten something.” Norman swivelled on his heel and retreated back into the store. He found himself a column to watch from but was soon shooed away from his post by an idle security guard.\n\nHe wished people were more like his socks.\n\n\n\n" }

Norman knew he could turn on the TV without the remote but he worried that it might become too loud and he would have to get up from his chair to change it. He searched everywhere he could think to look in his living room but it was nowhere to be found. Norman was starting to get anxious now, CSI would be on soon but the remote was nowhere to be found. He sat down for a moment, gathering his thoughts to think about where he might have left it. After a good 3 to 4 minutes of thinking he decided this was all too much for him and skipping tonight’s episode of CSI might be for the best. He slowly trudged up the stairs, upset about missing CSI but confident he had made the right decision. Norman turned off his lights and moved his bed sheets over to lay down.

He remembered now, it had run out of batteries and Norman kept all of his batteries upstairs in the bedroom. Norman quickly got out of bed, grabbed the remote and walked down the stairs with a smile on his face. He sat down in his chair and let Norman rest on his lap, he turned on the TV just in time for the opening credits of CSI and held down on the volume button just because he could now do so. “That was a close one!” Said Norman.

Although payday was a couple days away, Norman decided to treat himself. After all, it was his first time winning the quarterly raffle at work. It seemed like fate that he walked away with a $25 gift card to his favorite restaurant.\n\nAs the waitress leaned in to grab Norman’s plate, she placed the check face down on the table. “Whenever you’re ready” she said, smiling as she walked away. On any other occasion this moment would have given Norman anxiety as he hated to depart with his hard earned money, but with the gift card in his pocket he reached for the check with a confident grin.\n\nNorman calculated the meal perfectly: Diet Soda - $3, 8oz Steak (Well Done) a la carte - $11, Chocolate Cake $6. After tax, that left enough remaining on the gift card to give the waitress a 15% tip. The service wasn’t great, but Norman felt that leaving anything less than a 15% tip would be rude. \n\nHowever, when Norman grabbed the check and glanced down at the total his sense of confidence deflated like a balloon- $24.63. But how, he wondered. Anxious and confused, he brushed the beads of sweat forming on his brow and reviewed the breakdown of his bill. He noticed the problem instantaneously. The waitress charged his steak as a meal and not a la carte. \n\n“Is something wrong, sir?” \n\nIn his state of disbelief Norman hadn’t noticed the waitress approach the table to retrieve the check. Norman shifted in his chair as he looked up at the waitress, and folded the receipt as if hiding the mistake on the bill would help avoid the waitress from prodding any further. \n\n“No…no. Everything is fine” he replied as he reached for the gift card in his pocket and handed it to the waitress. \n\n“Ok, I’ll be right back.” The waitress left and Norman breathed a sigh of relief at the small victory. Yet, the problem remained. What would he leave as a tip? He pulled out his black leather wallet and searched for cash but found none. Then, he considered giving the waitress his debit card when she returned and ask that she run the tip on that. However, he quickly dismissed the idea in fear of inconveniencing the waitress. Plus, the extra minutes spent running the card would make him arrive home late and miss the beginning of his favorite show. \n\n “Here you are, sir. Have a great rest of your night.” The waitress returned quicker than Norman anticipated. Norman returned her pleasantries with a nod; avoiding eye contact with the waitress, hoping she wouldn’t see his panic stricken face. \n\nFacing defeat, Norman grabbed the pen to sign off on the bill. The tip of the pen met the receipt as he attempted to sign his name, but the pen was dry. Then the idea hit him.\n\nNorman exited the restaurant. His shirt pocket felt lighter than it had when he walked in, but the bill was paid – tip included. He only hoped the waitress would enjoy his favorite pen as much as he had. " }

By this time, Norman would be finished logging onto his work computer, tucking his briefcase underneath his desk, and packing his navy blue lunchbox safely away in the top right corner of the communal refrigerator (Norman liked to be one of the first people to choose a spot for his lunch – the bottom two shelves always got leaked on and more than once, Norman had excitedly pulled out his lunchbox to eat his turkey bologna sandwich only to have a pool of ice water cascade over his work slacks).\n\nAnd every Monday between 9:12 and 9:13, Jasper would ask Norman how his weekend had been.  “It was nice,” Norman would respond, following up with varying attempts to desperately remember if he had left his house at all, other than to do the shopping - “I got caught up on some reading and spent some time with Norman” (Jasper would assume Norman meant his son rather than his cat). Sometimes, Jasper would ask Norman which book he was reading now, but more often than not, he would simply smile pityingly and tell Norman about his excursion to Long Island or his day out on his wife’s sailboat.\nThis particular Monday, however, Norman was prepared. Norman’s son had invited him to a move-in celebration at his new apartment in Upper Manhattan and they had spent a lovely weekend together, with Norman Jr. showing his father his favourite places to go for brunch and the best time of day to go for a walk in the nearby park. This Monday, Norman would have an answer to Jasper’s regular question that he could be proud of.\n\nNorman glanced at the clock on his computer monitor. 9:14. Norman’s brow became increasingly furrowed as he glanced again and again at the monitor over the next sixteen minutes, wondering if Jasper had taken the day off. He finally felt his shoulders loosen as Jasper jogged into the office, panting. Norman smiled expectantly, waiting for his coworker to ask him about his weekend.\n\n“Some traffic today, huh?” Jasper directed the question at Norman. “It’s like three drops of rain trickle down and everybody forgets how to drive.”\n\n“Oh, yeah, right? Nuts,” Norman laughed.\n\nNorman always made sure to get to the office at promptly 8:57, so he had missed the rain and, apparently, the traffic, too. Norman waited for Jasper to follow up with their usual exchange, but Jasper sat down at his desk and got to work, making up for his lost time. Norman opened his mouth, thinking about bringing up the weekend first, but he thought better and closed it again. Jasper was probably eager to get caught up. Disappointed that he couldn’t share his story with Jasper, Norman opened up the Excel spreadsheet he had been working on. *I’ll take myself somewhere special this weekend*, Norman thought." }

While Norman’s ascetic lifestyle typically prevented him from having much to contribute to the aforementioned garage sale, he always tried to find an item or two to sell. A pair of shoes that rubbed his heel wrong. A button-down that had been liberated of a few of its buttons. Things that were still useful, but not to him.\n\nThis year Norman elected to check the attic. He seemed to remember stashing a few of Melinda’s things up there, and he was certain he would find some of Norman Jr’s old toys as well.\n\nIt had been years since Norman ventured into the attic. He noticed immediately that some of the insulation had fallen down. *A chore for another day*, Norman thought. He rummaged through old boxes of bowling trophies and wondered why he had stopped playing. He seemed to remember Melinda disliking that he came home smelling like cigarettes. *But smoking is banned in most places now. I don’t need to worry about smoke any longer*, he mused, and then he remembered that he no longer needed to worry about Melinda either.\n\nAmongst the detritus Norman found Norman Jr’s Big Wheel, sun-faded and missing a rear wheel, an old baseball mitt, and eight large Rubbermaid containers filled with Legos. Norman stuffed the baseball mitt into his back pocket and began hauling the Legos out of the attic.\n\nAfter wiping the copious amount of dust off the Rubbermaids, Norman opened each one. Each box was organized by color, and in one of the boxes he found a three-ring binder containing the directions for all of the sets he and Melinda bought for Norman Jr. Pirate ships and castles. Spaceships and cattle ranches. Norman sat down amongst the boxes and flipped through all directions. There was a time in Norman’s youth when he would have ignored the manuals and simply let his imagination build whatever it pleased, but now the thought of not following the instructions made Norman’s palms sweat. He settled on a model of a plane. He thought it looked like a crop duster, and he always enjoyed watching crop dusters come in close to the ground, close enough to touch it seemed, and then soar back up into the air again, unreachable.\n\nAt first the build went smoothly. The plane used a lot of standard size pieces, and finding them within the boxes was easy. However, when he got to the more intricate parts of the plane, the pieces became increasingly difficult to find. *Why didn’t organize these by type*, he thought, *That would’ve made this much simpler.* But Norman was committed. After an hour or so, he had completed his airplane. He set it upon the coffee table and then laid down on the couch. \n\nMuch to his surprise, Norman napped. While he slept, Norman had joined him on the couch, curling up on his abdomen and partaking in a nap of his own. Norman awoke to Norman’s soft purring and the kneading of his paws. “We must’ve been tired, Norman. Perhaps the heat of the attic took it out of us.” Not wanting to upset Norman, he picked him up before he swung his own legs off the couch. Norman had made sun tea yesterday, and a cold glass of tea seemed a perfect post-nap refreshment. He took two steps towards his kitchen when a pain he had not felt in years coursed through his body. Without thinking, he dropped Norman and simultaneously raised his right knee, catching Norman with his thigh. Norman yowled just as Norman yowled. Norman fell back on the couch, cradling his right foot. He ran his hand along the base of his foot and dislodged the small white Lego that had planted itself in his heel. For several minutes Norman rubbed his foot. \n\nOnce the pain abated, he attempted to find Norman, but he had run off and hid. Norman hoped he would forgive him. Forgoing the tea, Norman dismantled his airplane and returned the pieces to their respective boxes and gave his carpet a final sweeping for any other renegade Legos. Satisfied there were no remaining pieces, he loaded up the Rubbermaids and carried them down to his neighbors.\n\nHe hoped some other father did not suffer the same fate as he.\n" }

Norman, the curious creature he was, came out to examine the leaves. Seeing them drift in the breeze, he couldn't help but pounce! Norman landed in Norman's largest leaf pile with a great \"whoosh!\" Norman couldn't help but laugh. He threw handfuls of leaves for the cat to chase. \n\nOnce they were tuckered out, Norman realized he'd made more of a mess than there had been when he started. \"Oh well, I guess I'll have to start over tomorrow,\" he told his little yard-work partner. \"But, you know, raking the leaves wasn't quite as bad as I thought after all.\"\n\nEDIT: Added a comma and deleted a typo" }

Just make a move!\"\n\nNorman did not make a move. He thought back to Lisa's final shift at his office, before she was transferred to a downtown branch. She wore a beige blouse with a long white skirt, and Norman, desperate to try and speak openly about his feelings for her, had to change his shirt three times that day due to the excessive nervous sweating.\n\nAt the lunch hour, Norman and Lisa were in the break room, by themselves, silently waiting for a popcorn bag to be finished with the microwave. Lisa squirmed, stepping her toes on top of each other, and each time Norman and her glanced at each other, no words were spoken- just raised eyebrows and a smack of the lips as if to say, 'Yep, here we are.'  \n\n\"So!\" Lisa said, in between a lip smack.\n\n\"Busy day?\" Norman asked. \n\n\"Yes! Very... It's my last day and all...\"\n\n\"Oh, yeah!\" Norman responded. He was sweating again. He wanted to stop, but he figured if he just blurted it out, if he just told Lisa that she made him feel like a little boy with a crush on the prettiest girl in school, or that he felt happier with her than any time spent with his ex-wife, or that, if she requested it, would move to the downtown branch along with her, if it meant that they could stay together. \n\nNorman said none of those things. The popcorn timer dinged, and three hours later, Lisa's desk was packed into a cardboard box, and left scant a trace behind.

He remembered his feelings for her, and the incredible urge to be bold in the final moments of knowing her. But now, as time goes on, Norman didn't feel as if he really missed anything out of the ordinary in his life. He had many crushes over the years; barista's, secretaries, regulars on the bus route, next door neighbors, and celebrities every now and then.

All these people that had gathered here, and from them not a single scream was heard, nor a broken cry, nee, not even a breathless whisper escaped their lips. He couldn't believe it. Were they really oblivious to the terror so rapidly approaching them? How were they able to sit there so casually, on the field of grass, with the picnic blanket and the sleeping dogs? He felt like the only man alive, yet unable to make a difference as he could feel the giant feet soundlessly come nearer.\n\nAs he stood there, his feet rooted to the ground, he realized that to continue this silence was to continue the beast. He tried to scream, but his voice wasn't there. As his body failed him, his mind jumped into action. The determined focus that had been a part of him for as long as he could remember, that often burdensome quality which seemed to make him a bore to the world, was suddenly hard at work. He closed his eyes and listened. The quiet now seemed almost overwhelming, but his focus had grown so strong that even the thought of a sound made the tiny hairs in his ears tingle.\n\nAnd there it was. At first it was less than a whisper. But with continuing attention it grew louder, until it was like a breeze. Louder, and a memory clicked in place: he saw the waves crashing into the shore and heard their gentle swooshing. Louder still it grew, as he started walking towards the ocean, that now seemed to beckon him with its sloshing call. He started running, arms swinging wildly around his body, his mind entranced by the pull of the waves. He ran into the surf and fell to his knees. He reached his arms up to the heavens, opened his mouth and let out a cry of desperation, \"POSEIDON!\".\n\nAs the waves gently engulfed him he saw how the heavens opened, and a bright white light appeared that grew bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and biggger and biiggher ant bijghjerrrrrr bjghrrrrrr, bjghrrrrr, bjghrrrrr, bjghrrrruurrhhrhrh ugh.\n\nNorman scratched his head. It was still dark outside. The Ocean alarm tone was nice, he thought, but he should really switch off the vibrate function. Still drowsy, he clicked through the app's settings to find it. There it was, under \"Advanced\". The word made him think: was this really the smartest thing to do? And so early in the morning? His father always used to say, \"If it won't work easily, don't force it\". This decision did not feel easy. Norman pressed the \"Home\" button, closed the app, and locked his phone. \"Why am I on my phone first thing in the morning?\", he asked himself. \"That's not a healthy way to start the day\". This got him thinking about healthy ways to start the day, health food, vegans, alternative medicine, the New Age movement, and he suddenly thought of a colleague of his who was always talking about dreams, and finding meaning in them. He wasn't sure whether any of that was true or not, but he had so far found himself unable to explain what exactly dreams are.\n\nHe remembered being in a dream, but forgot what it was about. Something to do with being boring and everything was quiet. He tried closing his eyes, as his colleague had told him, to get back into the dream state. This sounded very appealing, and so he dozed off for a moment, until a sudden thought, \"Work!\", awoke him with a shock. \"I'll think about the dream later\", Norman said to himself, his voice sounding somewhat determined.\n\nAs soon as he poured the milk over his cornflakes, he had forgotten about it.\n\n" }

While Norman does not boast having a good day-to-day memory, sometimes a random piece of his past finds its way to the forefront of his mind. \"Huh, it's December 19th,\" Norman thinks to himself. \"This is about the time Melinda and I first started getting serious.\"\n\nIt was the first finals week of their first semester of college, a whole week of firsts for the two freshmen. Melinda had just finished her last final for the semester, and Norman agreed to meet her in the local coffee shop for a celebratory caffeinated beverage. Although the past two weeks were stressful, Norman saw a noticeable difference in Melinda's countenance. Her smile was radiant, and her laughter was contagious once again. Norman felt like he was seeing her for the first time all over again. \n\nDuring a brief pause in the dialogue, Norman felt like the moment was just too right. The soft jazz playing over the speaker, her perfectly messy hair, her scarf a tangled mess around her neck, the genuine peace-with-the-world feeling he had in his heart - Norman felt truly alive in this moment, and bolder than he ever felt before.  If he did not say those three words now, he may never work up the courage to say them again. \n\n\"Melinda, I love you.\"\n\nShe glanced up from her coffee with a surprised look on her face - a good kind of surprised. She smiled her crooked smile, and looked down at her coffee. Her cheeks turned the color of fresh-picked roses. \n\n\"I love you too, Norman.\"\n\nThe coffee maker sighed as the last drops of coffee fell into the pot. Norman sighed along with it, feeling the weight of reality starting to creep back onto his shoulders. \"Oh, well,\" said Norman. \"Time to start another week.\"\n\nNorman smiled faintly as he drank his coffee. Maybe a little walk down memory lane isn't such a bad way to start a Monday. " }

Wiltshire sat perfectly still in Gladys' wrinkled arms, her tight curly coat matching Gladys' perm to a tee. \"What can I do for you?\"\n\n\"Do you know how to play Euchre, sonny?\" Gladys asked with a voice that sounded like a thin breeze through ancient papyrus. Norman did dimly recall the rules of the card game from his undergraduate days but hadn't played in years. \"My partner is out of town today and I always go to the Euchre night at the community center on Saturdays. But I don't have a partner for tonight! Mind taking an old girl out on the town?\"\n\nNorman simply couldn't say no, but he knew that he was no match for the wizened greybeards and bluehairs at the community center. Would they mock him for his poor play? Would Gladys be upset if he didn't agree to take her? Words from Norman's father echoed in his mind - \"humor the elderly - they know things you don't\". And how brave Gladys was to ask such a thing! Norman just couldn't say no.\n\n\"Su-sure, Gladys! That sounds like fun. I'm a bit rusty though.\"\n\n\"Glad to hear it, sprout!\" Gladys' eyes wore a rheumy twinkle while fingers stained brown with years of digging in dirt ran through Wiltshire's fur. \"If you're not up to anything why don't you come meet my daughter Carol and have a cup of tea at my place? She and her friend are visiting before a concert in town tonight and we can have a few trial hands of cards.

Norman wondered how so many plants grew inside with only the one, albeit large, window. Outside, the balcony dripped with ruby-red cherry tomatoes. Leaves of plants unknown to Norman waved in the gentle breeze. The complex camphor of flowers and spices lingered even indoors.\n\n\"Cream in your tea, Norman? Or are you one of those heretics who ruin their tea with sugar?\" Gladys had wasted no time in getting tea ready for her guests. Carol's rebuttal was half-embarrassed, half-teasing.\n\n\"Mom, I'm pretty sure calling people heretics is a few centuries outdated. And yes, I'm one of those heretics now.\" Gladys tut-tutted with her tongue. Even while joking Carol had a soothing voice.\n\n\"I take my tea black, thanks\", said Amal.\n\n\"Whatever's easiest by you\", said Norman. It would not do to be a nuisance.\n\nDeftly dodging an assortment of leaves near the window, Gladys navigated the tea tray to her tiny coffee table. Gladys hadn't skimped on the cream for Norman but he could only barely start sipping the brew before the flapping of cards being shuffled rang through the apartment.\n\n\"Okay, kids! Time to play Euchre. My heretic daughter and Amal versus the people who know how tea *ought* to be served. Teas vult, Norman!\"\n\nNorman had no idea what that meant and he wasn't about to ask.\n\nThe cards were dealt. Gladys winked as she called trump; Norman had the left bower but nothing else to help her.\n\n\"Hey, Norman\". Norman looked at Carol. Her fingernails seemed impossibly long. \"You seem tensed up. Anything on your mind?\"\n\nThere was plenty on Norman's mind. He still hadn't thought of a gift for Norm's Convocation. There was a tricky assignment at work that came right from the top waiting on Norman's work desk. And of course he couldn't let Gladys down tonight at the community center.\n\n\"Oh, you know...work and things.\" Norman was almost certain that Carol wouldn't buy his attempt at sounding confident. He burned the nine of hearts and Gladys took the trick. Amal played the trump Ace on the next trick. Here was Norman's chance! His left bower won the trick. Norman smiled - he hadn't had this much fun playing cards since undergrad.\n\n\"Speaking of work, what do you two do?\"  Norman feared that his attempt at conversation was weak. If it was, nobody mentioned it. Amal was a traffic engineer; Carol was a therapist doing her Masters at Norman's alma mater and working on a clinical research study with her supervisor.\n\nIt's funny, Norman thought, the last time he played Euchre he was also with students from his alma mater. Maybe Norm learned how to play while he was there too.\n\nThe afternoon passed quickly in chatter and warmth, and soon it was time to part ways. Gladys told Wiltshire not to eat her tomatoes and Norman shuffled back to his unit to make sure Norman had food before the two started off for the community center." }

Called Da-uh, Norman today about the tickets. He seemed really hurt. I don't know why you even want Randy to come to Convocation. He doesn't exactly seem to care. Anyways, you should get the tickets today or tomorrow. I'll see you at Convocation.\"\n\nShit. Norm was upset. No \"I love you\" - not even a goodbye. Face pursed, she scoured the mail that Randy had crudely piled on the table and found the tickets. As her finger traced the crest of her alma mater on the envelope Julia fretted. Why was Norm so cold towards Randy? Randy was a part of their family. And besides, seeing Norman would be upsetting. He had never taken Norm skiing in the Alps, or on safari, or even to sports camp. Julia had worked her ass off to be able to afford the best for Norm, and Norman hadn't. Simple as that. Norman's feelings were less important than having the family together to celebrate Norm's Convocation. Right?\n\nJulia tried to take her mind off of the matter by running over her mental checklist for Norm's surprise Convocation afterparty. His roommate Steve had suggested guests for the event. She had already organized the caterers. She read somewhere that scrapbooks were in, so she had hired some woman off Etsy to make the thing. Julia had been putting off digging through the albums to send scrapbook content to the Etsy woman. It wasn't like Randy would do it. Once again, Julia thought, I have to do everything.\n\nAt the sight of the dusty albums Julia felt a deep stab of guilt in her soul and remembered why she was putting it off.\n\nIf there was anything Julia regretted most about the divorce it was not telling Norman where the family photo albums went. Norman was adamant about photographing their young family - it was something between a vocation and a hobby. He wasn't bad at it either. There were pictures of baby Norm in a wagon, Norm with Julia's parents, Norm as a toddler in a bumblebee costume - all gold.\n\nAs she organized the future contents of the scrapbook into a parcel Julia ruminated. A part of Norman died when she said that the albums were lost. Nobody deserved that. How could she have lied like that? Julia was haunted by the memory - Norman's staggered sobbing, her closing their front door for the last time...\n\n\"Focus, Julia\". She stomped her feelings down as she sorted the photos and prepped the parcel for mailing.\n\nAs she fitfully struggled to fall asleep that night Julia wondered how Norman took the news about Convocation. She really hoped Norm would like the scrapbook. She loved her son so very much." }

It would spill into rumors eventually. Perhaps he should take hold of it while he can. Norman felt like the Monica Lewinsky of the office place.\n\nNorman decided not to confront Frank- not today.

Perhaps junk-mail was now being delivered in bulk. He bit his lip and carefully scissored open the seal.    \n&amp;nbsp;    \nHe lifted the flaps to reveal that the box was filled with cassette tapes. These can't have been his. He couldn't remember lending any cassette tapes to anyone. In fact, he couldn't recall even liking this much music. 'The Human League', 'Ultravox', 'Dexys Midnight Runners'.

Norman slowly stretched out while staring at the bedroom door. On a tired dresser to Norman’s left sat two photos in identical frames and a daily pill organizer with one day remaining. The first photo was a black-and-white shot from a long time ago, and the other was of Norman sitting sphinx-like on the couch. All was normal here. Feet fell on plush beige carpet and Norman headed down the hall, dodging some socks that hadn’t made it to the laundry hamper. The apartment definitely had to be cleaned up a little. Even the two degrees hanging in the bedroom were lazily askew.\n\nNorman turned the corner, passing the washroom and the washer/dryer while looking towards the closet at the end of the hall. Nothing seemed off here. Oddly quiet, perhaps. Norman turned to take a look at the front door. Nothing. Hmm. Ah, well. Suddenly, a pang of hunger. Time for a snack.\n\nNorman started for the kitchen by walking through the living room. The drapes had been pulled closed and the sparsely-furnished room as a result sighed a tired, lifeless shade of blue. The old wood-panelled television lay dead against the wall, staring blankly at the once-luxurious brown couch that Norman had known and loved for so very long. An old handmade quilt limped across the arm of the couch and onto the floor, grazing the half-finished crossword that lay awkwardly sprawled over the other cushions. Norman stopped to scratch an itch before continuing.\n\nHooking through the dining room, past the cheap tablecloth flopping over a formica table as if resigned to a grave fate, Norman reached the kitchen. Norman sat a moment in there to enjoy some food and a quick drink. Sunlight creeped into the kitchen through the window in the next room. A crayon drawing of a house and a photo of Norm as a child clung to the fridge by way of a souvenir magnet from London. Norman had never been there. The clock, a tacky affair that looked like a black cat clicked its eternal temporal rhythm. Norman watched the counterweight swing for a few seconds before moving on.\n\nThe rich smell of old books and the gentle kiss of sunlight greeted Norman in the library. This was the warmest room in the house, handsomely housing a fastidiously-curated book collection. But today Norman had another reason for enjoying this room so much. A forgotten cup of tea and a flipped-over sci-fi novel sat together on the wooden endtable next to the chair. The table on the other side of the recliner held Norman’s record player. Milk crates full of records sat loyally underneath the table. The pillow usually tucked against the back of the big plush recliner had fallen over in the sun. It felt warm and soft on Norman’s fur, and the sunbeam nuzzled him to sleep as the two big speakers against the walls kept watch.\n\nLife was good.\n___\n\nWelcome to this Normanverse!

He stepped on his linoleum floor, noticing the sound his slippers made on the floor.\n\n\"Hmm. I feel like I'm making a ruckus. What do you think, Norman?\" Norman simply nuzzles his flannel pant leg, in hopes of a snack himself. \"I'll turn on the tv, that should drown out the noise.\"\n\nHe quickly returned to the living room, turned on the tv and settled on a volume that wasn't too loud, and didn't bother changing the channel because he didn't want to caught up in whatever show was on.\n\nHe returned to the kitchen, grabbed a plate and pulled out some turkey, cheese, and grabbed the bread from the top of the fridge. He tore off a tiny piece of turkey, which was low sodium because he thought it would be better for him, and dropped it on the floor in front of Norman, who jumped with delight as he started to eat it. While Norman was preoccupied he put a few slices of turkey on a slice of bread, then a single slice of cheese, then the top slice of bread. He put everything back in the fridge, and walked, with his planted sandwich, to his favorite chair and pulled a tray table towards him.\nHe looked at the sandwich, his stomach growling slightly, and told himself that he was going to wait until he decided on what to watch. He reached on the coffee table for his remote, but his hand couldn't find it. He switched his gaze to the coffee table, thinking he moved it from it's spot but it wasn't anywhere in the table.\n\"That's odd,\" he said to Norman, who was licking his face trying to get every last flavor of turkey that remained. \"Do you see it under the table?\" Norman just looked up at him, and gave a very content 'mrow'. Norman stood up and looked on the other tables in the living room, none of which had the remote on it. He looked under the coffee table, and then under the chair. Nothing. He digs around in the sides and under the cushion of the chair, and he still couldn't find it.\n\n\"Oh goodness,\" he muttered.\n\nHe went over to the bookcase and looked on each shelf, hoping he left it there by mistake. But, unfortunately, it wasn't there. He scratched his head in confusion, checked his pockets, and walked back into the kitchen.\n\"They should have a bell on these things. I mean, come on, where could I have left it?\" Norman walked to the fridge, and noticing it wasn't there he walked back to the living room where Norman had jumped up on the tray table and was sniffing around on his plate. \"Norman, no! I already gave you some turkey. If you get down now, there's a good chance I'll give you another piece.\" As if listening, Norman jumped off the table and laid right next to the chair.\n\nNorman sat down, pulled the tray table towards him, and with a sigh he bit into the sandwich. \"At least the bread's soft.\"\nHe gazed up and started watching whatever was on tv. It was the end of a documentary on inmate life in prison. They went into detail on what food was available through commissary, and how inmates use food as money.\n\"Norman, can you believe you can buy all these things with just food?\" Norman looked up just as Norman dropped another piece of turkey, and this time he pawed at it before eating it. Norman was on his last bite of the sandwich and before he got up to put the dish in the sink he pet Norman and said \"Good thing we're not in prison, Norman. I don't think I'd know how to price food, for all I know I could've bought another Norman with that turkey.\"\n\nNorman meowed at him, stretching. \"Oh, Norman, you know I would never get another Norman. You're my favorite.\" Norman dropped the dish in the sink and noticed the remote was on top of the fridge, right next to the loaf of bread. \"Oh, my.

Norman decided it would be a good day to take a stroll along the beach; it wouldn't be too busy at this time. With each step, the wet sand consumed his feet, grinding between his toes. The scent of the salty ocean swept up into his nostrils with each crashing wave, clearing his head as well as his sinuses. Norman had been worrying all week about the presentation on Monday, but today his mind felt fresh and liberated.\n\nSuddenly, something hard collided with his toe. Norman looked down. The end of his toenail had cracked ever so slightly, but there in front of his feet was a glass bottle. He picked it up, pulled out the cork, and discovered a wet, rolled up piece of paper inside. He unravelled it, reading as best he could the smudged words. It read simply this:\n\nTo whom it may concern,\nI am writing this letter because I am lonely. It is my fortieth birthday today, and I am celebrating by signing divorce papers. You don't know me, you don't even know what I look like, but I really believe I am a good person at heart. I have a lot to give. I just fell for the wrong man, who left me utterly lost and alone. I have no friends, no family. I just want someone to sweep me off my feet, someone to make me happy, someone to hold me at night. I just want... someone. Even if it's just a friend, or a shoulder to cry on. Maybe you're in a similar situation to me. Maybe we could help each other. Make each other happy again.\n\nShe provided details of her whereabouts. Apparently, she could be found sitting on a red bench at the top of a hill at a local park Norman knew well (he was connoisseur of walking routes after all) at precisely midday every Sunday. It was obvious nobody had come across this letter yet. If they had, and if they had intended to pay a visit to this mysterious woman, they'd have most likely kept the letter.\n\nNorman placed it delicately inside the bottle, and squeezed the cork back in, carrying it along the beach. He approached a lifeguard, sat in his high chair.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" he said. \"I found this on the beach just over there. Could you please tell me where I can dispose of it? I wouldn't want anyone to accidentally step on it and break it. It'd be awfully sharp. Someone could really hurt themselves.\"\n\nThe lifeguard pointed him in the direction of a bin. Norman disposed of the glass bottle, smiling with pride at the thought of his good deed. Besides, anyone could have found that letter: a murderer; a stalker; a rapist. Later that day, Norman sat in his recliner, watching the latest season of Grey's Anatomy. He fell asleep at 8:00pm, Norman purring on his lap, waking up briefly again at 9:00pm to write in his diary:\n\nDear diary,\nToday was a good day." }

What if he didnt like the flavour? He thought long and hard about whether or not he'd take the gum and as he was about to answer he noticed the jogger gone, Norman felt terrible.

He had been running low for quite a while, but had not yet completed the task, simply because there were so few occasions in which they were needed anymore. (This, Norman thought, was a shame.) \n\nUsually, he'd head off to the Post Office after enjoying his toast and feeding Norman, but today, Norman had a different idea. While he never fancied himself an eavesdropper, he couldn't help but overhear things occasionally- and, the previous week, he had overheard his coworker Lisa mentioning that she had seen some lovely novelty stamps online whilst browsing for some new hand lotion.\n\nNorman felt a small thrill as his laptop whirred to life. What a strange thought! He no longer had to settle for the options his local Post Office stocked. The sky was the limit! Feline Norman stretched lazily, not seeming to grasp the exciting prospects ahead of Norman.\n\nAfter clicking on a few wrong links (he had typed in \"stamps\" instead of \"postage stamps\", leading to some red herrings) he finally reached an online marketplace filled to the brim with different types of stamps.\n\nAs he scrolled through the page, his timid smile grew. Stamps with cats on them! Stamps with coffee cups! He even marveled at a colorful Kwanzaa stamp; although he did not celebrate the holiday, he appreciated the mastery of the art.\n\n\"What do you think I should get, Norman?\" He asked the disinterested cat. The cat did not acknowledge Norman.\n\n\"I wonder if they have CSI stamps.\" He chuckled to himself. Norman, of course, would never actually *use* such a silly stamp, because it would seem odd to the receiver, but his mind delighted in showing off his interests in a small, impractical way.\n\nAs he scrolled back to the top of the page, intending to type \"CSI\" in the search bar, he noticed something alarming.\n\n*Page 1 of 148*, declared the arrow in the top right corner.\n\n148 pages of stamps? *That must be a mistake*, Norman thought with a hint of awe. *That is entirely too many stamps.*\n\nNorman asked Norman for his opinion once more, but the cat offered nothing more than a tail-flick. \n\nFeeling suddenly overwhelmed, Norman slowly shut his laptop, and decided he would visit the Post Office on Thursday.\n\n" }

He strode with purpose towards the nearest strip mall.

He admitted to himself that Family Dollar was probably equally terrible when it came to exploiting workers, but one had to start somewhere.  \n\nHe entered the store and reached for a hand basket.  Then feeling uncharacteristically bold he grabbed a bright red shopping cart instead.  He began his shopping at one side of the store, stashing items in his cart as he went.  Store brand of aleve, cheap shampoo, a new pack of combs.  Finally he was in the aisles that held the holiday decorations.  He wondered about getting an artificial tree, but knew he wanted a real one instead.  He had really not been in the mood for Christmas for the past several years, but he had to get out of his funk!  Sometimes, Norman thought, one has to at least go through the motions.  He chose a green wreath decked out with multi-colored balls, a cinnamon scented candle, a couple of strings of lights, two stockings, one green for himself and one peppermint striped for his cat.   He realized that stockings meant gifts.  Hmmm, thought Norman, what would Cat like?  What would I like?  Swiftly he walked to the pet aisle and grabbed several bags of kitty treats, a box of premium cat food, and a catnip mouse.  Feeling reckless he tossed in a ball with a bell and then put in a new cat dish, too.  Smiling, he walked to the food area.  Candy canes, chocolate kisses, shortbread cookies, all went into the cart.  He also bought two boxes of breakfast cereal, and then getting stern with himself, added a sensible box of old fashioned oatmeal.  \"Boring old oatmeal\" he muttered.  He hated plain oatmeal but knew it was good for him.  He added a bag of dried cranberries and some brown sugar to his cart; if he had to eat it plain it would just languish on his shelf.\n\nUpon arriving home he hid all the cat gifts in the closet.  He hung up one set of lights on his porch, the other around the window inside where he and his cat could enjoy them.  He realized that he was almost happy.  He began to head outside with the wreath so he could hang it on his door but thought better of it.  instead, he hung it on the inside of his door.  If I put it outside he thought, I will hardly ever get to enjoy it.\n\nHe sat down, thinking hard.  Cat came and sat on his lap, purring loudly.  Gently, Norman scratched his cat's ears, the cat closed his eyes in pleasure.  \"Cat\", said Norman, \"tomorrow I am going to go get us a real Christmas tree, and some decorations for it.  You have never seen a Christmas tree but I think you will like it.  I should only buy unbreakable ornaments, so it won't matter if you climb the tree.\"  Norman was quiet for a time, then said to his cat, \"I am also going to get a couple of Christmas cards, I'm going to send one to my ex-wife, and also my son.  I wish I was closer to him.\"  Sadly Norman realized he had no idea what his son would enjoy getting for Christmas, but he had the bright idea to stick a $100 Amazon gift card in the envelope.

{ "subreddit" : "lifeofnorman", "title" : "Norman Crosses the Bridge", "text" : "Norman was having an unfortunately poor day. A Monday, no less. That morning he showed up to work with a pile of paperwork waiting to greet him, and Rich Tucker, his boss, was also having an unfortunate day, resulting in a few snaps and jabs at Norman. Norman sighed as he took down the paperwork one page at a time, eager for the lunch break.\n\nDuring the lunch break, Norman explored the possibilities of renting apartments in different cities. Chicago, Dallas, Springfield- all these places could be the answer to Norman's monotonous life. A change of scenery. His cat hated travelling, but perhaps it was necessary for Norman to feel good about where he was in life once again.\n\nAfter work, Norman felt exhausted, but it was the first warm day of the season, and he decided to go for a walk. He wasn't quite sure where he was heading towards- at first, it was to find a Burger King, but Norman passed by a road he's never walked down before. In the distance was a sunset, and to Norman, it almost seemed as if it was speaking to him.\n\nThe road went on and on, until it stopped being a road, and more of a trail. Soon Norman started to realize where he was- a nature trail, leading into a nearby valley. He knew the valley well- the public bus Norman took everyday to work crossed a bridge that hung over the valley. However, in the 10 years that Norman lived in the city, he never once stepped foot in it, until today.\n\nIn the ravine, Norman was enamored by the tall trees; the deer wandering through the woods, and the families having afternoon pic-nics. He bumped into one particular family that reminded him of his own; a man, a woman, and a small boy. It didn't help that the little boy looked just like Junior. As Norman passed by the family, he noticed they were trying to take a group photo.\n\n\"Would you like some help with that?\" Norman offered. They graciously accepted, and as if he were a ghost, Norman took a photo of the family, framing them along the river.\n\nNorman continued his journey through the woods, taking a moment to stand by the mostly dried riverbed. In front of him were a flock of geese, huddling near the pillars of the bridge. A beaver dived into the water and swam into its dam. What Norman found most relaxing of all, was the wind- a long and groaning whistle came from the trees, and like an aftershock, the grass whistled too. The sounds of the city were gone.\n\nAs Norman headed home, he took a walk across the bridge that he was solely used to being driven across. A bench sat in the center, looking out at the river. It was calm, like glass. Norman spat off the edge, waiting one, two, three, four seconds before it splatted below him. For a moment, Norman thought of jumping.\n\n Normally, the reasoning against it was always selfless- if he died, who would look after his cat? What would Junior think? What kind of child might find his body? It would scar the child for life, and it would be his fault.\n\nBut this was different for him. It wasn't the thought of others that stopped Norman from jumping, but it was the moment itself. Norman wasn't afraid of heights, and he knew that the only way he would fall off the bridge is if he jumped. But in this moment, Norman didn't want to jump. He was enjoying himself, he was happy, and everything seemed to be okay. He was having too good of a time to end it all early.\n\nNorman walked home, thinking about his day. The answer isn't that the city is boring, that it would all be fixed with a move to another city. The answer would be the same wherever he was- the little things; helping a family take a photo, skipping rocks on glass, the sound of the wind. He knew it wasn't the view that made him happy today; but his perspective.\n\nNorman went to sleep without watching CSI this day. On his bedside table, Norman put down a flower that he picked earlier on the trail. It smelled good, it reminded him of the adventure he had. He knew it would die eventually. He would have to go pluck another soon." }

Frank was slender, balder, and far more quiet than Norman- whose own hushed demeanor was something not to be underestimated. For the past nine years, the two men sat solemnly beside each other in the confines of their cubicle. In the morning they would say “Morning” to each other, and as they packed up their briefcases for the day, they would say “Evening”, even though both of them left the office at the same time, rode the elevator at the same time, and even wait at the bus stop at the same time. It didn’t help that they lived in the same apartment building, as well as the same floor.\n\nNorman knew very little about Frank. Occasionally he would hear Frank discuss politics with Robert from sales, and from the amount of times Frank ordered in for lunch, Norman could tell he was a fan of Vietnamese food. Norman also knew that Frank had a wife named Josie, and an eight year old daughter named Amber. Norman felt that this was his one connection to Frank, if the two ever talked. Norman and his ex-wife divorced when Junior was only seven, and because of that, Norman was jealous of Frank.

Please take a moment in your day to wish him Happy Birthday!”*\n\nNorman hesitated. He quickly closed the email, just in case Frank saw it. It would spoil any surprise birthday parties, if anyone had happened to plan one for him. Norman then had to consider his options- say Happy Birthday to his face, and risk stumbling over his words, or write a carefully worded, but less thoughtful, email? \n\n“Hey Norman,” said Frank as he swung his chair around, “it’s my birthday.”\n\n“Oh really? Happy-birday,” Norman slurred unconvincingly. He wished that Frank had said that to him in an email instead. \n\t\n“Since it’s Friday, I’m looking for someone to get drunk with tonight. I don’t normally ask you, but all I know is I’m not getting home until it’s real late.

Glancing to the couch he saw Norman curled up and purring softly, sleeping soundly, with no knowledge of the weight of the matter at hand. Norman almost envied his blissful ignorance,  yet at the same time was excited he stumbled upon this opportunity. With Norman being asleep he knew this was his best chance to begin. Norman reached slowly into his jacket pocket. Pulling out its contents he unexpectedly found a JC Penny's receipt from the previous week he had forgotten to file with his other receipts.  \"How could I be so careless?\" He thought to himself.  However, Norman was much to excited about what he sat down to do and instead of filing the receipt in its proper place, Norman tucked it away in the \"to file\" section of his filing cabinet. Norman sat back down making sure not to wake Norman. Reaching back into his jacket pocket he pulled it out; a small leaflet of paper taken from a coffee shop bulletin board. It read: \"Creative Writing Contest: 1st palce $20 Walgreens giftcard.\" Norman had always wanted to write short stories and had fond memories of the time in high school where he almost signed up for a creative writing course. \"This is it.\" Norman said quietly to himself,  \"This is the day the world meets Norman; short story author.\" \n\nAfter many hours, it was finished and ready to be submitted. Norman patted Norman's head and filled up his food bowl with a special treat for being so good while he wrote his story. Hopping in his car he sat out for the coffee shop. When he arrived the reality of the situation sat in, \"it's now or never\" he thought. As he got out of the car he almost forgot his story. Walking into the building he looked over to the contest flyer on the bulliten board and could see this was the last day to submit any work. He noticed only 6 of the original 10 leaflets hanging from the flyer. Norman knew he had competition. Walking to the counter he handed the barista his most prized possession asking, \"When will the winner be announced?\" She said they'll post the results on the bulletin board a week from today. Norman thought that to be an eternity. With a sigh of relief he walked to the door with a slight smile as his eyes made contact with the flyer again. \n\nThe days seemed to stand still and Norman's anxiety grew. Monday came and went, then Tuesday, Wednesday,  Thursday. The weekend was close, friday dragged by. Norman could have swore he saw the hands on the clock moving backwards as Saturday neared. Finally, it was Sunday. Today was the day. Norman gathered his nerves and after his normal sunday morning routine made his way to the coffee shop. \"Breathe\" he thought. His palms were sweaty. Entering the shop he approached the bulletin board.  There it was, the results. Norman closed his eyes, took a deep breath, reopened them to see the list of winners:\n\n    1st prize: Darlene McMann\n\n    2nd prize: Yvonne Bates\n\n    3rd prize: Stephen Marks\n\nAnd there it was. His name in what seemed to be lights. \n\n    Honorable mention: Norman\n\nNorman exhaled.

I see now\", Norman jumped in the box and grabbed his toy mouse and immediately ran upstairs leaving Norman alone in the secluded area. Another sigh. Norman closed the box in the same manner as when he did when she left, being sure to leave things neat in case she ever returned....'for her things'. As punctual as Norman is he was pressed for time and did not have time to make himself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for lunch.

The rest of the show was significantly more to his liking, as he found himself no longer distracted by the man's stench.

He wanted desperately to thank the mysterious sender, but still could not fathom who it could have been.\n\nAfter the show Norman stood to leave, but with horror noticed that the stinky man had turned to him. He tried to avoid eye contact, but then the man began to speak. Norman's palms were sweaty. His heart pounded. The man was going to accuse him of making fun of his body odor! He was going to angrily insult Norman! \n\n\"Great show, don't you think?\" the man asked. \"I didn't know if it was worth all the praise, but it definitely was!\"\n\n\"Yes, it certainly was,\" muttered Norman. \n\nHe quickly made his way out of the theatre and sped home (not a millimeter over the speed limit, mind you) in his car.

It was Sunday afternoon and the station was almost empty, and Norman stood watching for the yellow and blue train that arrived exactly on time. He got in and settled himself down on the window seat of a four-seater. There were a few other people in the carriage, all of them alone and looking at their phones, reading papers or listening to music. It was peaceful here.\n\nThe first leg of Norman's trip was quiet and beautiful. As soon as the train left the station, Norman's mind drifted off into nothingness, quietly taking in the green fields the train casually rode by. In his mind, Norman imagined a little man hopping along over obstacles like trees, rivers or sheds that were on the route. It was a game he had played in his head ever since he was a kid, though he had never told anyone about the silly imagination.\nThen Norman thought about what he'd say if someone asked where he was going. He always had a backstory prepared about visiting friends in a nearby city, just in case someone, like a conductor, would ask. Thankfully, that hadn't happened yet, so Norman went back to enjoying the beautiful view or the countryside.\n\nWhen Norman's train arrived at the first station, he noticed something strange. The platform was more crowded than usual. Way more crowded. Normally, there would hardly be any people here, that never had been, not on Sunday afternoons, but this time Norman saw even from the window that there were a lot of passengers here, making it seem almost like rush hour.\n\nWhen the train stopped, the massive crowd squirmed itself into the carriage. In no time, all seats were taken, and some people even had to keep standing. Norman's four-seater was full too, and he had to sit up straight not to touch knees with a rather annoyed looking man opposite him. Next to him there was a woman who had headphones on. Norman could hear the beats of her music.\n\nAs the train left the station, the conductor spoke over the intercom. \"Ladies and gentlemen, as you've noticed we're a little over our usual capacity. This is due to a reroute elsewhere, which made us pick up some more passengers. We apologize for the inconvenience.\"\n\nNorman tried to ignore the crowd and stared outside again, but he simply couldn't enjoy the landscapes anymore. His mind kept going to the man opposite him, wondering if he wasn't bothering him with his knees. He also kept glancing at a women who was standing up, and contemplated whether she was old enough that he should offer her his seat or that she might be offended because he'd think she was too old. He decided not to do it.\n\nThe next 20 minutes weren't much fun. Norman didn't enjoy his trip at all and decided to get out at the next station. When he'd squeezed  himself through the other passengers in the aisle, muttering \"excuse me\"s under his breath and gently elbowing his way around them to the doors, he found the platform deserted. He went to the little kiosk on the station and bought a large coffee to go, and sat down on one of the benches. \n\nHe patiently waited for the next train which would arrive in only 29 minutes. He didn't mind. He didn't have a particular destination anyway.\n" }

It was a rotten day for Norman to forget the charger because he was awaiting a call from a woman he had met Friday night with whom he had been getting on famously.\n\nShe had told Norman she would call him today, and he felt just terrible about leaving the voicemail she must have left unanswered on his dead mobile phone. What must she be thinking of him? Would she want to talk to him at all anymore, or had he blown his chance with her? He imagined her giving up after trying his phone again and again; placing it out of sight so she wouldn't try to contact him again. Would she think Norman didn't like her? Or would she just assume he was very busy, after all? Would she refuse to talk to Norman if he called her back this evening? Norman hoped it wouldn't come to that.

Not much had happened to Norman over the past decade, since he figured he would save all his energy for his fifties, and wait for time travel to be invented so he could go back and use his time more wisely. But he didn’t have a decade. If the doctor was correct, he only had two weeks.\n\nNorman packed his cat into his travelling cage, a spacious box with a blanket at the bottom and a treat in the back, and prepared for the long drive into the city.

He needed the coat to hide the wet spot on the back of his shirt, but now it was causing uncontrolled sweating and he just knew that the rest of his shirt would be soaked through soon enough. He struggled to get his coat off and saw the beginnings of dark marks around his arm pits. But the he was finally at the bus stop and he sat down to try and get control of his reeling mind.\n\nNorman looked at his watch to see that not only was he not late, he was actually 20 minutes early! He let out a sigh of relief and sat back on the bench, closing his eyes and breathing deep breaths. When he felt calm again, he perked up and looked around. The bus stop was rather empty. Norman had never considered that an earlier bus might help to miss the morning traffic, and made a mental note to try and get up early on Mondays just to have some time to himself on the way to work from now on- what a lucky discovery! The day that started out so ominously was starting to look up.\n\nThe bus came and Norman got on. Seeing that there were only a couple other riders and he could essentially pick whichever seat he wanted sent a thrill through Norman and confirmed to him that getting up early at least once a week was a grand idea. He stopped sweating as he took his seat near the front and the air inside the bus was cool enough that he figured his shirt would be dry by the time he got to work. Yes, things were definitely looking up!\n\nTwenty minutes later Norman got off and walked the block toward work feeling as though he was walking on clouds. When he reached for the door of the office, he was surprised to find that it was locked. Was he *too* early, perhaps? He looked about and then took a seat on the planter in front of the building to wait for someone to open the doors. A few minutes later and Norman spotted Harold, one of the security guards, coming around the corner.\n\n\"Good morning, Norman,\" said Harold amiabily.\n\n\"Good morning, Harold\" replied Norman. \"C-\" \n\nBefore Norman could ask Harold to open the door, he had a horrible realization: the missed alarm clock, the rush to get ready, the empty bus, they all came together to form a ball of nausea in the pit of Norman's stomach.\n\n\"What are you doing here on a Saturday, eh, trying to impress the boss?\" Harold asked with a grin and knowing wink.\n\nNorman mumbled out a response that must have been some sort of agreement with the notion, and Harold opened the door for him. Sitting at his cubicle, Norman stared off at nothing wondering how he could get himself out of this mess. If he left, Harold would know what a fool he was, but he wasn't authorized for overtime so he didn't dare do any work. If used his computer for non work-related reasons, he was sure he would be found out and let go, and he didn't even have a book to keep him company! Norman closed his eye and slowly lowered his head down until his forehead touched the edge of the desk. After 8 agonizing hours replaying his morning over and over and trying to spot how he could have realized his mistake before making it to the office, he finally headed out the door." }

Suggestions?\n\n___\n\nGladys had refused Norman's offer to drive them to the community center, and Norman was struggling to understand why. To be honest Gladys confused Norman more often than he cared to admit. As they walked out the front door of the apartment complex Gladys stopped to grab a discarded can from the flowerbeds. \"I'd love to have a bench here, Norman. Right about...\" she pointed to a shady spot between two flowering trees \"there. Those magnolias are majestic, don't you think? With a little footpath leading there it would be perfect. I tell you, Norman. Not a place on Earth I'd rather be.\"\n\nAs the branches swayed and the rich smell of the blossoms wafted over Norman he found it hard to disagree. A block up the road Gladys was again staring at a tree. \"These guys make conkers. You ever play conkers, Norman?\" He hadn't, but he wondered if the two of them looked a bit daft standing there. He fidgeted a bit. Why hadn't they driven? There was free parking at the community center, but when he mentioned it at the apartment building Gladys' face went dark. \"Parking lots are the enemy\", she said with a flash in her eyes. Norman dared not vocalize any disagreement.\n\nThe more they walked, the more Norman learned about the neighborhood. He hadn't really explored the area since he moved into his apartment. It seemed to Norman that Gladys knew more about this stretch of town than anyone. Gladys seemingly knew everyone and waved to people as she told Norman stories. He struggled to keep up as Gladys' finger pointed out landmarks. \"When Arnold and I first moved here that building was a theatre called the Prosperity. Double features were a dime in those days.\" Norman would have never guessed that of the humble laundromat.\n\nThere was a corner market on Saturdays here back then. That house on the right was once owned by two Belgians and made truffles that Gladys described with more colorful language than Norman was used to hearing. When they reached a non-descript parking lot Gladys paused. \"This was once Amal's Dad's bakery. It was so good to see him again. I'm glad Faisal is doing well.\"\n\nBefore Norman had time to comment Gladys was already gone, chatting while beckoning Norman towards a place called the Caffe Valletta. \"Leo! Anna! Merħba! Meet my friend Norman!\" Norman hoped he sounded sincere while shaking hands and introducing himself. Norman declined an offer for espresso for fear of staying up too late.\n\nAs they carried on their way Norman thought about what Gladys said. \"Meet my friend\". He was her friend. That meant a lot to Norman. Even if he was a terrible partner against the wizards of Euchre he felt that Gladys would still care about him. Before he knew it they arrived. Some wrought-iron streetlamps had winked to life and Gladys was nose-deep in a flowerbed in front of the community center.\n\nNorman dimly understood why Gladys would rather walk." }

It was his first new car and he got a great deal by trading in his 1996 Ford Taurus for what the salesman kept referring to as a “Smart” car. \n\nNorman wasn’t entirely sure how the car was smart, but was relieved to be rid of the salesman’s endless – “You’d be making a *smart* choice if you purchase this car” – puns. In spite of his discomforts, the great gas mileage and opportunity to save a little money was really what made Norman feel smart for buying the car. *Up to 40 miles per gallon*, the salesman told him; *even more if you use cruise control*. Norman had never used cruise control before as his old Taurus didn’t have that feature, but he figured he’d give it a try if it meant more mpg’s. \n\nAs Norman got on the freeway he slowly pressed down on the gas pedal and got up to a respectable 60 miles per hour. *I think it’s about time to try out this cruise control*, he thought to himself and pressed his thumb down on the cruise control button. A small green light labeled “CRUISE” popped up on his dashboard, and he cautiously removed his foot from the gas. \n\nJust then, the brake lights on the car in front of him lit up sending a jolt of fear from his chest to his toes. As he quickly placed his foot on the brake pedal he wondered why he ever thought relinquishing control of his life to a car would be a good idea. The green “CRUISE” light disappeared from Norman’s dashboard, he breathed a sigh of relief, and he safely remained five car lengths behind the car in front of him. \n\n“Whew, that was close,” Norman muttered to himself. \n\nHe then turned up the radio to clear his mind and started to feel little less “Smart” for buying a new car." }

Hope you enjoy! Tell me later what you think.”\n\nNorman grabbed a fork and plate, scooped up a small amount of tuna casserole and returned to his desk. *I can just throw it away and she’ll never know*, he thought.

The cubicle became a rather quiet place- albeit it had always been a quiet place. Norman missed saying “Morning” and “Evening” to someone, and while Norman tried his best to make a friendship blossom with the secretary, Norman’s greetings were only met with a cold smile. Norman did not confront Frank about the shouting he heard that one night, or the night after that, or the one after that, before Frank left on vacation leave. In Norman’s defense, it was never as aggressive or violent as the first night; it was slow and dithering fighting, one that Norman supposed exhausted itself after some time.\n\nOne night, Norman came home and heard no shouting, no fighting. It was quiet. Norman was relieved that it came to an end on its own without him needing to get involved, but he was left wondering how it came to be. Did Josie leave? Did she take Amber with her? Or did they work it out? Or were they killed and hid in the closet? Were they hid in Norman’s closet? Norman checked his closet,  and learned nothing. He continued to speculate regularly as he rode to work on the public transit, to put in his hours in the small and empty cubicle. The smell of Vietnamese lunches started to dissipate, weeks passed, and Norman’s mind started to become occupied with irrelvant day-to-day problems once again.\n\nNorman walked home from the grocery store one evening, settling on having chicken breasts and rice for dinner. It was his favorite meal- he didn’t know why, it just was- and he was soon daydreaming about if he would rather bread the chicken or have it grilled. Norman waited for the dreadfully slow apartment elevator to arrive. *There are only three floors,* Norman grumbled to himself, as he shifted the plastic shopping bag from one hand to the other, trying to revive his curled fingers from feeling so numb.\n\nThe elevator doors opened to reveal Frank, his head hung down, buried into his phone. He would have walked past Norman completely if Norman hadn’t mumbled hello. \n\n“Hey Norman,” said Frank quietly. “How have you been?” \n\n“Good, good… How’s your vacation? Did you go anywhere?”\n\n“I thought about it. I have family in Maine I was thinking of visiting…”’ Frank stepped out of the elevator, shifting his way towards the front door of the apartment. “But I changed my mind. Just kicked it here for the time being.”\n\n“Well it’s always good to take a break,” said Norman. Frank nodded.\n\n“When will you be back at work?”\n\n“Not sure, Norman. At least another week. I was thinking I might quit.”\n\n“Oh really?” said Norman. “Yeah, maybe.” said Frank. Frank stepped towards the door. “Anyways, I have to run Norman. Good to see you.”\n\nFrank made his way towards the door, leaving behind Norman with an open mouth.\n\n“Frank,” Norman called out, before the door shut completely. Frank stuck his foot out. Norman hesitated for a moment, unsure if he was about to say something rude- if he wanted to say something rude- or if saying something rude was the only option he had.\n\n“Is everything okay, Frank?” Norman started to blush, feeling as if he’d overstepped a boundary.\n\nFrank shrugged. “No,” he said. He then started to laugh it off, passing it as depraved humor. Norman didn’t join in.\n\n“Well if you want… I have some extra chicken breasts for dinner. If you’d like to join me and my cat Norman tonight…”\n\n“Your cat’s name is Norman?” joked Frank. Norman nodded. “I never knew that.. I never thought to ask, I guess.”\n\nThe two of them laughed, and Frank transitioned to hold the door with his hand instead of his foot. “… Sure, Norman. Why not.” Norman nodded to Frank and Frank nodded, back, before Norman nodded one more time and made things uncomfortable. \n\n“See you, Norman.” Frank said. He stepped out the front door, and Norman called for the elevator one more time, with a warm smile on his face. \n\n\n***\n\nWell, that's all, folks.

With a peculiar look on his face, Norman wondered if he should flip his phone over with one hand, and at least see who the messages were from. As he came closer and closer to a red light, Norman was getting anxious. He felt his right hand break contact with the steering wheel, but he immediately re-grasped it. \"I should keep both hands on the steering wheel at all times,\" Norman said to himself. The phone would have to wait. " }
{ "subreddit" : "lifeofnorman", "title" : "Norman's evening.", "text" : "Norman sighed heavily.  He was sitting on the bus, very disgruntled. His car was in the shop, so was reduced to commuting by bus.  He had missed the express bus and so was forced to take the slow bus...the one that stops every two blocks and is filled with odd folks.  Finally, after an agonizingly long ride he was able to exit the bus and breathe unused air.  \n\nHe walked the several blocks to his home.  As he came close he saw the string of Christmas lights he had hung up shining in the dusk.  And at the window, peering out at him was Norman.  Norman felt a surge of love jolt through him.  He went in and stroked Norman, and kissed him on his furry head.  Norman hung up his jacket and placed his going-to-work shoes in the closet.  Then he laid out on his bed clean navy blue sweats and thick wool socks.  \"I have got to get the bus-people pollution off me\", he informed Norman.  Norman blinked his calm, green cat eyes at Norman, not understanding but loving the sound of his person's voice.  Norman took a long hot shower, steaming up the bathroom.  He had a new bottle of Dr. Bronner's Peppermint Soap and he inhaled the minty scent deeply.  After his shower he got dressed in his sweats and headed to the kitchen, Norman trailing behind.  \n\nNorman stared in his fridge, considering.  Making a decision he reached for the pack of chicken breasts.  He made a marinade with red wine, basil pesto, and black pepper.  He poured himself a glass of wine and smiled softly as he took a sip. Next, Norman poured a saucer of milk for Norman.  Norman lapped happily at the milk.  \n\nNorman put on a Malcom Watson cd that he had had for many years.  The soothing violin sounds filled the warm kitchen.  Norman sipped at his wine while stirring up a batch of whole wheat muffins and making a green salad.  Finally he sauteed the chicken in his old cast iron skillet.  It had been his Grandmother's and he felt that she would be happy to know her grandson was using the same skillet she had cooked so many good meals in.\n\nHis meal finished he and Norman sat side by side at the table.  Norman and Norman both loved chicken.  \"Don't worry, Norman\", said Norman.  I made the whole pack.  We will enjoy leftovers tomorrow.\"  \n\nAfter supper Norman headed to bed.  He had a new Jim Butcher book he was looking forward to.  He snuggled in, glass of wine at hand and Norman snuggling against his full stomach.  Norman turned to the first page, content, and began reading." }

After he sealed each envelope, Norman realized he'd forgotten an important detail: stamps.\n\n\nNorman ransacked his desk with the fury of an elderly barbarian before accepting the devastating truth. He had no choice but to abandon his Saturday routine, put on pants, and go out. As an added indignity, his desk was now somewhat messy.\n\n\nWhile choosing between slacks and the risky-but-satisfying freedom of jeans, Norman muttered. It was inconvenient to go out to buy stamps. They're a paper product, they should be available to anyone at any time. In fact, they should be printable. Foreign excitement flooded Norman. Stamps SHOULD be printable. It was a genius idea.\n\n\nNorman pulled the slacks from his closet since he may see someone he knew at the store. It wouldn’t do to be seen in jeans. As he dressed, he imagined the potential for his concept. He could make millions and finally earn the respect he’d believed he always deserved. To complement the slacks, Norman slipped on a collared shirt and tie. The would better suit his new persona. Rich Norman. Successful Norman. Before leaving, he paused at his computer to see if anyone else already had the notion before him.\n\n\nHe typed Google into the Yahoo search engine, then from Google's site he searched for printable stamps. He stared at the results. Norman wasn't sure which disappointed him more, that someone had marketed the idea long before it blossomed in his own mind, or that he'd put on a tie unnecessarily. He sighed. At least he didn’t have to go out. Norman undressed while his printer slowly hummed out the stamps." }

Apparently, Norman needed to relax more but the idea of getting a massage from anyone other than Norman was terrifying. Norman enjoyed when he and Norman would cuddle up together and Norman would start to purr and knead his thigh with his paws. This is the closest Norman had ever come to a massage. So, here he was, in the waiting room not sure what to expect. When he heard a voice over the new age music saying \"Norman?\" \n\nIt was a man with a Russian accent who looked like a body builder, wearing scrubs. Norman wanted to run away but instead he followed Dr. Egglestein's orders. The man said \"Hello, Norman, my name is Boris. and I'll be your massage therapist today.\" He had a firm handshake and a welcoming smile. Which made Norman slightly more comfortable until ... He took Norman into a room with dim lights, scented candles and whale sounds with ocean waves playing from an ipod. Then much to Norman's surprise, Boris asked him to get undressed and lie face down on the table. Boris stepped out and Norman was alone in this unfamiliar room getting undressed. But, HOW undressed should he get? He was too nervous to ask. So, he gets down to his tidy whities and decides to leave them on. After all, this is a first visit. He lies face down between the sheets with his face in this little toilet seat looking pillow. Boris knocks on the door and Norman answers \"Come in\" even though he didn't mean it. Boris put his warm hands on Norman's back and for the first time Norman took a deep breath and started to relax. As he exhaled slowly he felt himself drifting away. Within 2 minutes, he was snoring. 50 minutes later, Boris gently nudges Norman out of a dream and tells him he's all finished. \"Get up slowly and come out when you're dressed.\" Realizing he is no longer in French Morocco, Norman rubs his eyes and gets up. Norman dresses himself and floats out of the room. Boris is standing there with a little paper cup of water for Norman. He tells him to stay hydrated and come back next week.

He eventually settled on a romantic comedy starring Steve Carrell and Jennifer Aniston. \n\nAfter purchasing his ticket, he made his way to the concession stand where he decided to buy a medium popcorn and medium drink to enjoy as he viewed the movie. 'Oh boy,' Norman thought worriedly as he was leaving the concession stand and making his way to his movie, 'having only popcorn and soda for dinner will be terrible for my cholesterol.' 'I should eat some of my leftover tuna salad when I get home. Wouldn't want it to spoil either.' And after that thought, he found himself in the movie room, where he quickly chose a seat in the lower middle and prepared for a night of love and laughs.\n\nLater that night, he re-heated his tuna salad and ate in his bed as he watched CSI with Norman and waited until it was time to sleep." }

{ "subreddit" : "lifeofnorman", "title" : "Norman rips his pants", "text" : "Norman arrived home from work and hastened towards the door. He had stopped off at the store on the way home to purchase some cereal. Norman typically does his grocery shopping on a Sunday as to avoid this sort of rushed job, as he likes to peruse the fruit and vegetable section and see what new produce has been packed on the shelves. Last Sunday Norman had bought a mango. This particular day though, Norman had had a double serving of cereal for his breakfast as there was not enough left in the cereal box for another serving. \"What a lovely, unexpected treat\", Norman quirked at Norman, \"but this means I will have to make a quick dash to the store after work to refill\". \n\nTraffic was busier than usual on the way home. He had missed the peak traffic hour coming home from work thanks to his trip to the store, so he wondered why it was still just as busy. Norman peered at the digital clock on his radio dashboard, he made sure it was a quick glance, as to not hold up traffic in case there was a sudden burst of movement. '18:30' the clock read. 'CSI begins at 19:00', he thought to himself. Beads of sweat started to gather in his palms. He wiped his hands on his shirt quickly, before placing them both back on the steering wheel. The traffic started moving.\n\nAs Norman opened his front door and manoeuvred himself, his work bag and his shopping bag into the hallway, his belt loop became entangled on the doorknob. Norman had not noticed as he was too concerned with maintaining the integrity of the cereal box wedged in between himself and his work bag. It was too late anyway, the belt loop had snapped and released him. \n\n\"Oh fiddlebumps - what a nightmare\", Norman sighed. He had not thought to replace the sewing material his ex-wife had taken with her after she left, and now it had come back to bite him. \n\nAfter getting himself settled, he put on some long pyjama pants and turned on the television. It was the first segment of adverts during his CSI episode. He had already seen this one plenty of times so he did not mind missing the first 8 minutes. An advert popped up on screen advertising a new online clothing store. 'For the every day man, at an every day price', read the tagline. He decided to load up this website on his Dell laptop whilst waiting for CSI to return. He browsed the different categories until he found the section labelled 'Trousers'. There were some filters down the side to help him find something catered exactly for him. He chose the following filters, 'workwear', 'beige', 'neutral', 'N/A', 'medium'. It returned exactly 1 result. Realising his time was running out until CSI returned, he clicked on the trousers' thumbnail, quickly browsed through the model photos, before deciding that they were perfectly suitable, and at an 'every day price' too. He checked them out to his basket, input his debit card details and confirmed the purchase. Norman had received free next day delivery too as it was his first order. The CSI theme music played.

{ "subreddit" : "lifeofnorman", "title" : "My own adaptation of a few Norman stories", "text" : "I combined a few Norman submissions to imagine a different, larger story than before.  Not what is traditionally posted here but I thought I'd share.  \n\n\nHalfway through his day at work, Norman yawned.\n\n\"Oh no, don't start doing that now!\" Lisa joked.  Norman almost chuckled. \n\n\"Yeah, I know.\"\n\n\"Had a rough night?\"\n\n\"You could say that,\" Norman lied. Lisa laughed again, and Norman let out a rare smile that she didn’t notice.  Norman didn't have a rough night. Norman had gotten eight hours of restful sleep. He was always a little tired.  Instead of driving a route he was just working in the post office for the day.  Norman was perched over the counter, welcoming any customer that stopped by.  Weekly the hours passed as Norman fitted packages and sold stamps.  Whenever the bell rang Norman was trained to meet the customer’s eyes first.  Presently, the open door framed an elderly man.  He was a balding, whiskered fellow wearing a pack of cigarettes in his front pocket, only carrying a weak smile.  The worn baseball cap struck Norman’s memory.  “Armstrong, Will.  3502 Northside Drive,” Norman thought.\n\n“Found any work yet Bill?” What was left of Bill’s smile disappeared as he looked down at the skinny 30 something year old.\n \n“I’ve been looking for 5 months now, I’d say,”  This took Norman off guard, making his words take their time on the way out.\n\n“S-sorry to hear that,”  Norman tried to sound disappointed yet hopeful for Bill’s sake.  “What’s kept you busy then?”\n\n“Walking mostly.”  Without another word Norman sold 3502 Northside Drive some stamps, searching hard for anything cheery he remembered from the last encounter he’d had with the smoky fellow. Norman couldn’t think of anything.\n\n“Well have a good one!”\n\n“Uh-huh,”  grunted the old man.  The door tripped the bell on his way out, ringing in the sad, still silence.  Norman hoped that everyone at the office sympathized with his best efforts but, every head was bent down and away, all pretending not to notice.  Regardless, Norman couldn’t shake the thought of Bill out walking aimlessly, feeling unwanted.\n\nAt 3pm, Norman and a few others, including Lisa, stopped for a short break.  Lisa was young. She seemed to be of college-age (although Norman could only guess). Norman himself wasn’t old yet, but he didn’t feel that way around Lisa.  She was new enough to the office to ask daily where to find things.  She stood out in the office most, at least to Norman. Suddenly sitting up in the break room, turning to him as if to ask a question.\n“So Norman what did you for the weekend? See your family with the time off?”  Norman was taken back.\n\t“Yes.” he said, eventually. “We had a great time.”  Norman lied.\n\t“Well what d’you do for fun around here?”\n\t“We… went to a baseball game”  Norman had always wanted to.\n  \t“How fun!”  Norman nodded, rubbing his cheek uncomfortably.  \n\nThe manager, Mike, took notice of Norman.  And like a good host, he always tried to help things go smoothly.  He tempted Norman to smile at a joke about the weather, but Norman didn’t move, thinking of Bill, stuck without work. \n\n Finally the day was nearing it’s end when the bell tolled one final time.   Norman recognized the guest right away.  An elderly woman; “Bridgers, Marilyn 710 West Walnut Street”.  710 West Walnut Street had short gray hair that curled in all directions.  Eyes that were once sharp squinted behind faded glasses on her wrinkled face.  She seemed tired, not from fatigue, but simply worn, like Norman felt.\n\n“How are you today?” Norman inquired.  He recalled a distant memory of 710 West Walnut Street loving to get those letters from her grandkids.  “Heard much from the grandkids lately?”\n\n“I’m sure they’re fine, but they haven’t written in a few years now.”  Norman could hardly speak when he heard this. Regret slowly started to gnaw at him for prying in with such a senseless question.\n\n  “I’ll just take some more stamps, thank you.”\n\n“I’m sorry ma’am.”   Norman pulled out the sheet of flowered paper. “Is that all I can help you with today?”\n\n“Just that would be lovely, thank you.”   She left him feeling cold.  Norman knew that cold, and wondered if she felt it too. Norman didn’t speak again until he got home. \n\n\n“I have to do something for her.”  Norman said to himself.  He paced through the living room, which was darkened by a thick black curtain that spread across the only front window.   “But she’s not going listen to a word I say!  Should I just send her cookies? Flowers?”  Norman asked all this to his friend, Leon, wondering if flowers would even be appropriate.  Norman had never given gifts like these before.  Leon watched intently as Norman set the short table for dinner.  Norman did so inaccurately, arguing aloud with himself while he trickled cheese onto the spaghetti.   “What do I even say to her?  She doesn’t care about me or know me at all,”  thought norman. The cooling spaghetti meant that dinner was over. Leaning back in his chair, Norman looked down. Leon was sleeping curled under the lamplight, the sight of which helped to calm him. Norman thought he shouldn’t worry either, since Leon wasn’t worried, even if Leon was a cat. \n\nThe next day was Tuesday, and Norman was walking as usual to his building. Norman saw Lisa walking across the parking lot.  He also noticed that their paces were the same and would reach the door at the same time. Norman slowed down. \nThrough the day, Norman was particularly distracted.  He managed to avoid Lisa by working through the breaks and looking down and away, trying to look focused on his dull work. Norman fought with himself all this time, deciding if he would reach out to to Mrs. Bridgers that evening.  When finally it was closing time, Norman had settled on writing her a card. He printed out something that could pass for a card on the office printer.  Standing up, he tucked his seat back under the desk.  Norman walked a little too quickly through the halls.  He passed Lisa’s concerned look on his way to the exit.\n\n“Norman?” Her voice rose a little higher than normal. He stopped and looked back over his shoulder, not letting go of the door’s handle. “Where are you rushing off to so quickly?” \n\n“I have to go.”  Norman didn’t wait to find out if Lisa had more to say, as Lisa’s response was lost in the slam of the door.\nNorman couldn’t get Lisa off his mind as he drove.  Having driven this route a countless number of times before, Norman had no trouble finding 710 West Walnut Street amongst the winding streets in the wooded neighborhoods.  Norman parked a few houses before Mrs. Bridger’s.  It gave Norman time. Norman wanted to turn back and go home, but against his own will Norman’s hand descended on the card.  It was gray, with a silver flower on the front that he didn’t know the name of.  He walked meekly up to the single story home.  Norman rang the doorbell.  The buzz summoned a voice from the house. The voice was faint but came quickly.  The door opening revealed an elderly women with hair that curled in all directions.  \n\n“Good evening! How’re you today!”\n\n“I’m fine.” \n\n“Aren’t you my mailman, Mr-”\n\n“Just call me Norman.”  Norman cut in, surprised at how his own confidence.\n\n“Norman! Well how can I help *you* today?”  \n \n“I just came to deliver some mail,”  Norman looked down at the modestly colored card, “from me. I know you haven’t seen any letters from your grandkids a time now.”\n\n“How nice of you to do!  But I wouldn’t count it against them,” She dismissed. “You can hardly blame them, they’re all grown now,”  she sighed.  It wasn’t a sad or even lonely sigh, but one with a hint of a smile.  A lump in Norman's throat started to tug as he stared.\n\n“You don’t, miss them then?”  \n\n“Well of course I miss them,” she laughed “but they have lives of their own now, and I’m glad for them.  And of course they’ll visit when they can.” Norman nodded, feeling a little stupid holding the door for so long. \n“Thank you very much for the card!”  \n\n“Well I’m happy for you and your family,” Norman said.  “I’d better get going, have a good night.”\n\nThe next day was Wednesday, and halfway through he yawned quietly to himself.  This gave him a thought.  Norman peered over her cubicle to look at Lisa. Her hair was curled today.  He stared at his hands pondering this sudden shift, wondering how he felt about the change.\nStanding to \"walk to the water cooler\",  he passed by, confirming that her hair was indeed different.  \nWhen he came back to the front counter with a cup of water, he stopped in front of her's and said, \n\n\"Hey, Lisa.\"  She turned around and said, \n\n\"Oh hey Norman, how're you?\"\n\n\"I'm well, thank you. I noticed your hair looks different today.\" he ventured\nLisa laughed, to Norman’s great alarm.\n\n\"Well actually, my hair is always this way naturally. I hate how curly it is, but I was too lazy to straighten it this morning. So it's normal today!\"\n\n“Oh” He thought for a moment. A part of Norman fought back, but a less vocal but more intimate voice in his head took control this time,  \"I like normal.\"\n\nNorman stepped through the office back to his desk, amazed by his sudden courageousness. He couldn’t wait to tell Leon about the curls when he returned home.\nLooking at herself in the monitor, Lisa smiled. \n\n\n\nedit:\n\nHere are the posts I used to imagine this story.

{ "subreddit" : "lifeofnorman", "title" : "The Fourth of Norman", "text" : "There was a special place in Norman's heart for the Fourth of July. Every year, the office rented space at the city park to hold a picnic. It was quite the celebratory affair. Everyone in the building came out in their best casual clothing, laid out red-white-and-blue blankets and towels out on the grass, ate hotdogs, and played rousing games of volleyball out on the sand courts.\n\nNorman's part in the festivities was simple. He was to bring the potato salad. It was a simple job, but Norman took pride in his work, using an old family recipe which he'd first learned at the tender young age of thirteen. \"The secret,\" his mother had told him, \"is that each new generation adds an ingredient they think will go best with the current taste.\" His mother's sister, being the older of the two, had added a dash of lemon juice. Norman had deliberated for some time before settling on classic Dijon mustard. Norman's mother had taken one bite and declared it was the best potato salad she had ever eaten.\n\nThat Monday, Norman arose at 9 AM and went about his morning routine. Instead of putting on his work slacks and a dress shirt, however, Norman opted to wear jeans and a simple Hawaiian shirt decorated with pictures of tiny palm trees. He briefly debated whether or not he wanted to wear sandals or tennis shoes, then decided to compromise. *Socks and sandals it is,* he mused.\n\nNorman mewed happily as Norman entered the kitchen. \"Happy Fourth of July, Norman!\" Norman greeted his cat. He opened the fridge to check on the already-finished potato salad chilling in the crisper and retrieve some bread and jam for his breakfast. Then he went to the pantry to get a can of tuna to add to Norman's dish. He scooped the tuna out over Norman's regular kibble, and let Norman dig in.\n\nNorman left the house at 10 with the potato salad tucked safely in a patriotic-looking cooler, surrounded with several bags worth of ice. The radio played a big-band rendition of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" halfway through the trip. Norman tapped his fingers on the steering wheel the whole way through the song.\n\nLisa was in charge of the picnic food, as she was nearly every year. Once Norman arrived at the park, she directed him to the pavilion and had him set down the cooler on a picnic table.\n\n\"There it is,\" she said, lifting the Tupperware containers out of the cooler. \"Norman's World Famous Potato Salad!\"\n\nNorman blushed. \"I'm glad you like it.\"\n\n\"Norman, could you do me a huge favor? We don't have enough lemonade, and I need someone to buy some more. Could you do that?\" Norman accepted. It took him three tries, but he finally found a convenience store that wasn't closed and used his company card to buy five more gallons of lemonade. By the time he returned, it was time to eat.\n\nNorman spent the afternoon watching his coworkers play volleyball and fielding comments about the \"superior quality\" of his potato salad. He thanked them for the kind words, but politely declined to give anyone the recipe. Around three, Norman received a text message from his son:\n\n&gt; Hey dad, just wanted to say thanks for emailing me the potato salad recipe. My friends love it. I decided to add some bacon bits to the recipe though, I hope you don't mind. Maybe next year I'll come down and you can make it your way. Happy Fourth. TTYL\n\nBelow was a picture of Norman Jr. and his girlfriend on the beach. Norman chuckled to himself and sent a reply.\n\n&gt;Bacon bits on potato salad sounds perfect. \n\nHe watched the fireworks that evening with pride in both his country and his son." }

I think it's high time for a vacation!*\n\nAfter work, he went to the library to research places to go. France would be far too expensive in a few months' time and Italy would be too warm. England was too crowded for his taste. But, ah, Germany looked like just the spot! So Norman went about booking his plane ticket, hotel, etc.  \n\nOn the big day, Norman dropped off Norman the cat at his son's house and drove to the airport. The flight was long, but not unbearable, and as soon as he knew it, he was touching ground in Berlin. \n\nBy the time he'd set his bags down and had a shower at the hotel, it was dinner time and he was growing hungry. He had noticed some food stands on the same block as the hotel and decided he would try out one of those. \n\nThe very first one sold pizza. No, he thought, pizza was no good. He could get pizza in the United States. The second one said \"Eis\" on it: too many vowels-- too foreign. The third one said \"Döner\". Hey, he had heard about Döner in the travel guide! He decided he might have that. \n\n\"Gooten tag\" he said to the old, Turkish-looking woman manning the food stand, hardly looking up from his phrase book. \"Ick sprecke kein Deutch. Ick bin American. \"Sprickst doo English?\"\n\nThe old lady laughed and shook her head. \"No English.\" \n\n\"Can I have one?\" Norman held up one finger. The old woman seemed to know what he wanted and began preparing his meal. \n\n\"Mit Pommes?\" she asked. He shrugged and nodded while she piled some French fries onto the plate. He didn't like French fries, but he didn't really know what she'd asked. \"Sechs Euro fünfzig,\" she said, sliding the paper plate across the stand. \n\nHe tossed a 10€ bill at her and left without waiting to see if it was enough. The Döner was growing cold by the time he reached his room, but it was still pretty good. " }

It was a modest home, with no more space than was really necessary for one person, with the only exception being a second bedroom. Norman liked the idea of having a place for guests to stay when they came over. Maybe someone from out of town. After all, he was living in a new neighborhood. Maybe someone from work would want to come see his new place and he could offer them a bed to sleep in so they wouldn't have to drive home late. *That would be unsafe,* thought Norman. \n\nNorman also had a small backyard. It was something he had wanted for a long time. He wanted Norman to be able to go outside and play and maybe chase birds and squirrels; though hopefully not kill them. Norman didn't want to have to clean that up. \n\nNorman began exploring his new home. The kitchen was quite nice, with a fancier stove and refrigerator than he used to have. He had debated getting a garbage disposal, but that seemed excessive. Norman was more than happy to take the garbage out to the curb himself. He realized that the refrigerator had a water and ice machine on the front. This wasn't something Norman was used to. Maybe he had gone too far with the appliances. After all, they were very expensive, especially on his salary. Norman began to regret the purchase.\n\nNorman looked around for Norman, but he was nowhere to be seen. *He must be in the back yard.* Norman thought to himself. This made Norman happy, until he realized that Norman might start to become an outside cat, and spend less time with him. Norman loved coming home to see Norman excited to see him. Maybe those days were over. \n\nNorman decided to turn in a little early. He was looking forward to taking a walk around his new neighborhood in the morning and wanted to be well rested. Norman hadn't come inside yet, so Norman left the back door open for him to  come in when he was ready. He was sad to not be sleeping with Norman at the bottom of the bed, but tried to be happy for the fact that Norman was able to go out and explore more. He wondered what Norman was up to.\n\nNorman was woken up by his need to use the restroom. He ran into the bathroom to relieve himself. As he was standing there, he noticed that he was hungry. Norman decided to try out his new kitchen. On his way in, he noticed that Norman was sleeping on the chair in the living room, looking quite comfortable. Norman smiled at this thought as he looked over his breakfast options. He didn't have many different ingredients, and he realized he hadn't purchased a recipe book for his new home. Norman decided to make waffles. \n\nNorman fired up the stove and began to cook. As he did, he looked over to see if Norman was still asleep. He was. Norman wondered what Norman was dreaming about, and wondered whether or not he would stop going outside and exploring. He missed their old friendship, and Norman didn't seem like his usual, cuddly self.\n\nSuddenly, Norman looked down to see that a fire had started on the stove. He began to panic, looking around for a way to stop the fire. He realized that he had completely forgotten to purchase a fire alarm for the kitchen. *Silly Norman* he thought. *How could you forget that?* \n\nThe fire began to spread all around the kitchen.\nBefore he knew it, Norman was surrounded by flames. He ran as quickly as he could out of the house onto the sidewalk. He watched as the fire spread into the rest of the house. Through the open roof, he saw Norman escape out the back door. \n\nNorman turned off his computer monitor. *That wasn't very fun at all.* Norman thought. He had never been one for video games anyway. \n\nLater that night, as Norman got ready to go to bed, Norman, purring heavily jumped up and nestled himself by Norman's feet. *It's good to have things back to normal* Norman thought to himself.

It was the everything after. She slept sparsely, keeping awake to run her fingers along Norman’s stomach, her head resting on his chest.

He liked that it was going numb; it meant that she was as close as she could be.\n\n“Your heart is racing,” Claire whispered. \n\n“Sorry.”\n\n“You don’t need to apologize so much, Norman. You have more confidence than what you liked to believe.”\n\n“Then I’m not sorry.”\n\nNorman felt her smile form on his chest.

While his Mom had already offered him a job at her firm, Norm wanted to see if he could strike out on his own.\n\nThe front door slammed open to the sound of hollering. Steve's back, thought Norm. Shit. Even though the thin door to his room was closed it would be seconds before that ape of a man turned on his massive stereo and burs-\n\n\"Hey, buddy!

An unwashed plate rattled on his desk, moved by the thunderous bass of the beats pounding in the living room.

I'm sorry...\"\n\nThat's not how letters should start, Norm thought. Why had his mind jumped immediately to that unhappy memory? But Carol had told him to write what came naturally to him. What did come to him was a confusing mess of sadness, frustration, and lamentation weakly buttressed by crumbling syntax. It wasn't any kind of letter Norm would ever let see the light of day. Well, at least he had a list of things to talk about with Carol. He ended the letter before he totally collapsed.\n\n\"...why did you never call?\"\n\nOutside, the sound of smashing glass and cheers.

Across the street he noticed the neighbours' car. There were two young boys crouched behind it giggling to themselves. Norman smiled to himself and pretended not to see them. He went back inside and waited behind the door. As he waited, his smile became a chuckle as he rememered playing this game when he was a boy with his friend who lived two doors down. Norman wondered what old Richard was up to these days. He hadn't heard from his old friend since his father took a job in another city and they moved away. Norman hadn't thought about Richard for a long time. He was his best friend. \n\nNorman's nostaligia was interrupted by the sound of approaching footsteps and hushed childish giggling from the other side of the door. The doorbell rang and footsteps scampered away. Norman decided not to open the door straight away. That would spoil the game. Allowing an appropriate amount of time for the boys to resume their hiding place, Norman cleared his smile and opened the door. He stepped outside, still pretending not to see the boys behind the car across the street. He theatrically scratched his head in wonderment. He looked up and down the street, with his hand shiedling his eyes from the summer sun. As he scanned, he could see the boys trying to smother their laughter behind their hands. Norman found this strangly thrilling. He gave a dramatic shrug to himself and turned around, allowing a small smile to creep back to his lips. He could hear the boys laughing out loud as he closed the door behind him.\n\nWaiting behind the door again, Norman rememered how he used to make Norman Jr laugh when he was a young boy by acting the fool. Norman Jr laughed hardest when he did his pirate impression. \"Arr, it be time te be goin' te bed, matey. Ya harr\" he'd say, to Juniors squeals of delight. Norman chuckled to himself and wondered what Norman Jr was doing today. \n\nNorman decided that the next time the door bell rang, he would open the door quickly and shout \"YARRRR!!!\" like a pirate. He hoped it would make them laugh. He would have to make sure it was not too aggressive. He didn't really want to scare the boys. He waited with his hand on the door handle and listened closely, but he couldn't hear anything.\n\nAfter two or three minutes had passed, Norman returned to his chair. He scratched Norman behind the ear and smiled to himself, still lost in nostalgia. He reached for his phone, flipped it open, and with his index finger typed the message \"YA HARR MA8EY!\" and sent it to his son. He watched the message send and closed the phone.\n\nTwo hours later, Norman was watching CSI when his phone beeped. He opened it up and saw that it was a message from his son.

Deciding that he would have plenty of time he opened Internet Explorer and, after glancing at the latest news on MSN, typed \"www.google.com\" into the search bar and hit enter.  Once on the Google homepage, he searched \"how to sign up for a Facebook account\" and, because he happened to be feeling particularly daring, clicked I'm Feeling Lucky.  Norman was directed to the Facebook sign up page and began to fill in his information. Once he had finished he sent Lisa  a friend request, as promised, and checked the clock again.  It was 7:30 and CSI started at 8:00. Norman had just enough time to make a microwave dinner and feed Norman before the episode started.  Once his dinner was ready, Norman sat down to watch CSI until 10:00 when he promptly went to bed. \n\nThe next morning Norman awoke at 6:00 and fed Norman, fixing himself a bowl of unflavored oatmeal.  Normand decided that he would check to see if Lisa had accepted his friend request. Norman sat down at his computer and opened Facebook.  When the website loaded, he noticed a small red number on one of the icons and clicked on it.  A message appeared on the screen that said \"Norman Jr. would like to be your friend.\" Norman could hardly contain his excitement and clicked accept. Clicking on Norman Jr.'s name brought Norman to his son's profile where he had pictures of him and his friends at college.  Norman smiled to himself, happy to be a part of his son's life and grateful Norman Jr. would take the time to send the request.  Norman considered posting on Norman Jr's wall but decided that his son seemed much too busy for such frivolities. Instead,  Norman shut down his computer and sat down on the couch to watch CSI." }

A small dog ran into a plate glass window. Norman chuckled softly, and Junior, a fourteen month old baby, laughed so hard that he spewed up the chicken back onto the plate.\n\nNorman only managed a jerk forward motion to clean up before his wife took the lead. She took the plate out of Junior’s reach and tossed it into the kitchen sink, clanging violently with the dishes from the day before. She then went over to Junior, pulled his shirt off, and stomped over to the laundry room.\n\n“Need any help?” Norman muttered. No response.\n\nShe disappeared into the laundry room, shutting the door behind her. *What’s she doing in there?* Norman wondered. Norman continued to eat his dinner. Ten minutes later the episode of AFV had finished(the plate glass dog had won the ten grand), and Norman’s wife still hadn’t come out of the laundry room. Norman wondered if she was angry at him, if it was something he said. He didn’t see why that would be- he barely said anything at all this evening. Was it his socks? He did do a lot of walking about today, and perhaps the stench was getting to her.\n\nNorman walked quickly past the shut door and headed for the bedroom, finding a fresh pair of socks and put them on. He then sat down in his recliner, a wedding present from the in-laws.

Norman reasoned that normal people would either shop at the start of the week, or at the start of the weekend, so he would be beating the rush by doing it on Thursday. What Norman failed to account for was that not everyone shared his pathological lust for routine. He'd never find out that Tuesdays are just as busy as Mondays at the supermarket, because he'd never deviate.\n\n\n'A pity', Norman thought to himself as he browsed the scary new diet food for a reason to not go through with his promise, 'that Thursday is shopping day. The others at work have a Thirsty Thursday that I could go to if it wasn't held on Thursdays.' Norman didn't really think it was a pity though.\n\n\nPicking up a surprisingly heavy can, Norman added it to his cart, and sighed. Looking at the tin, he remembered why he was doing this, and whispered “Do it for Norman.” to himself. Norman smiled, and wheeled the trolley to the checkout area. He was almost excited about the diet. He thought about standing on the wheels and riding it, and got a rush of adrenaline from the thought. He was worried that the checkout lady might say something when she picked up the 'new' purchase, but she did not. \n\n\nAt home, he went over the instructions on the tin, and then opened the lid, and put it on a plate, tossing the can into the bin. \n\nIt didn't look very appetizing. \n\nNorman retrieved the discarded tin from the bin in case he forgot a step, but he didn't. He sighed, and put the plate down, and washed his hands.\n\n\nNorman looked at the strange new food apprehensively, and took a small bite from it. It wasn't very good; Norman scrunched up his face, and then meowed.\n\n\n‘Oh well,’ Norman said while reaching for the regular cat food, ‘you at least tried it this time’." }

Tacos came by the pair, and, for $3.99 he could get chicken, pork, or chorizo tacos. For $4.99 he could get two different varieties of tacos as a combo.

The footsteps sounded agitated- the other man wasn't interested in the urinals.\n\n*He was interested in the toilet.*\n\nNorman had hoped the man would see the locked door, leave the room, and check back in a minute, but no- the person paced back and forth, sighed, stood by the mirror, and waited, ever so patiently, for Norman to make a move. Norman couldn't do a thing under pressure like that. \n\n*Who would do this to me?!* Norman thought to himself in a panicked tone. He tried to peak under the stall to see the shoes of the other man. He knew that Andrew had recently purchased new orange sneakers, and was quite proud of wearing them, despite going against appropriate office attire. Norman bent down and saw the shoes- they weren't orange, as he'd hoped, but black, and scoffed. *Are those...*\n\nNorman looked up to the crack between the stall door, and there, he made contact. Eye contact.\n\nQuickly Norman's eyes flitted away, and the impatient man quickly left the bathroom. *It was Frank!*\n\nFrank was Norman's cubicle mate. He should have known that the scoffed shoes were his! He saw them every single day!\n\nNorman left the bathroom a moment later and returned to his cubicle. There, he saw Frank, quietly eating his sandwich over his keyboard. Black scoffed shoes leaned against the swivels on his chair. Neither man acknowledged each other.\n\nNorman pulled out his own lunch, and began to eat, pretending that violating act had never taken place.. Maybe he should say something. It would spill into rumors eventually. Perhaps he should take hold of it while he can. Norman felt like the Monica Lewinsky of the office place.\n\nNorman decided not to confront Frank- not today. He also felt too uncomfortable to eat his lunch beside him either. Norman carried his lunch into the bathroom and continued to finish eating it in the safety of the bathroom stall." }

It amounted to a cat, a television set, and a cubicle mate named Frank who would say \"good morning\" a little too late in the day, usually right before lunch. Norman was desperate for companionship.\n\nLuckily for Norman, he received an email from Andrew in sales. It was an invitation to drinks with a few of the other fellas from sales, and Eleanor from accounting, who's very popular in the office despite her dramatically-close-to-retirement age. Norman accepted the invitation.\n\nHowever, Norman felt differently once at the bar.\n\n\"The pussy-cocker, Danny, *oh* makes me fuckin' livid!\" shouted Tom to Andrew, with his back turned to Danny. The uproarious laughter failed to include Norman. \n\nIt's not that the jokes or the conversations tried to not include Norman, no, it was quite open for Norman to join in whenever he pleased. However, Norman still felt distant, disconnected from his peers, and lonely. Lonelier than he ever felt sitting by himself in front of his television with no one but his cat.\n\nNorman left The Pub early that night, only saying goodbye to Eleanor, as she was the only person to notice his departure.\n\nThe walk home only made things worse. *One step away from people, one step closer to a different kind of loneliness*, Norman thought solemnly.

So was Claire, but not so much as Norman. Together, the two spent the last five hours drinking and talking at a pub. They talked of nothing at all, a topic that Norman was well versed in, and despite Norman having trouble even saying “Good morning!” to the secretary back home, he found everything was just effortless with Claire. Something was burning inside of him that he hadn’t felt in years. *Maybe that’s the rum,* Norman thought to himself. \n\nThe two headed back for the hotel past dark; Norman leading her by the hand. Norman had a lovely evening, but he knew it was well past his time for sleep. Norman planned to have Claire back home within the hour, and have himself nursing this hangover to be soon after in the safety of his four star hotel room. The world was trying to knock Norman’s butt to the ground and he would not be having it.\n\n“Thanks for the evening once again, Norman.” Claire said calmly, and drunkenly. “Would you like some coffee?’\n\nNorman was drunk- but not stupid. Of course he knew that coffee was a bad idea at this time of night. What is she thinking? Norman thought. Drunk people have the darndest thoughts. Norman’s throat was rather parched, however, and after the maple cappuccino he had earlier in the day, he certainly had a hankering for more. He also had a hankering for pizza, and perhaps with another beer he would feel like Chinese food. Norman knew very well his level of sobriety.\n\n“I could have a cup, I suppose.” Norman stated. Claire smiled, and pulled the middle aged man by the shirt collar into the room. The door clicked behind. \n" }

Wembly Memorial Hall” read the tidy broze plaque affixed to the door. Internally Norman was terrified. Inside the hall were formica tables and fold-out chairs scattered like seeds on the heavily-glazed brown of the hardwood floor. Swooping lines and circles on the floor told Norman that the room also doubled as a room for indoor sport. At the end of the hall on a small counter sat an old kettle and a bowl of teabags. Here was where his rusted Euchre skills would be put to the test.\n\nGladys had already set to chattering with folks waiting for their fourth player to arrive, holding a steaming Styrofoam cup and shaking with laughter. Norman and Gladys’ opponents had yet to arrive. What surprised Norman was the distribution of ages. There were people Norman’s age; a teenager was staffing the tea and coffee bar. This wasn’t so bad, Norman thought to himself. So far.\n\nBefore too long Norman and Gladys’ opponents arrived. Burkes was Gladys’ age but stood nearly a head taller than Norman and had a voice like a church organ. His nephew Jonathon, a smaller chap probably around Norm’s age stood to introduce himself. Hoping to avoid awkward silence, Norman offered to grab his opponents something from the counter.\n\n“Thanks, Norman. I’d like some water”. The depth of Burkes’ voice reminded Norman of when his mother dragged him to church as a boy. Walking from the counter after thanking the acne-riddled teen, Norman thought about his old church and its massive pipe organ. It seemed omnipotent when Norman was a child, a gaping maw of unimaginable power that in theory transported its listeners to holy thoughts. Norman hadn’t gone in years but that deep timbre never stopped ringing in his soul.\n\nAs tricks and hands came and went Norman settled into routine. He had definitely made some bad plays here and there but the gentle teasing from the rest of the table didn’t sting like Norman thought it would. He learned more about his opponents and discovered that Burkes, like Norman’s father, had served in the war before quitting the Army. When Norman mentioned the commonality with his father Burkes asked if Norman’s father had said anything.\n\nHe hadn’t. In fact, Norman remembered his father to the table as a silent, sunken figure. He had never really gotten through to his father before he died. Before Norman sank into melancholy Gladys piped up about her father, an officer in the Navy who smoked a pipe and told fantastic tales of his time at sea. To have believed him Gladys’ father had fought the Kraken, repelled pirates, saved princes and princesses, delivered royal messages, and done all that before breakfast. They had a good laugh.\n\nAs they folded up their chairs Jonathon asked if Norman would be back next week. “But what about Gladys’ partner?” Norman was worried – he couldn’t supplant that person!\n\n“It’s okay, Norman. I finally convinced uncle Burkes to come out”.\n\nNorman looked forward to next Saturday.\n" }

As Norman pondered this, it occured to him that he could save some money by signing up for a movie rewards card. He checked his watch. His finance report was finished, and lunch was in seven minutes. \"I have time,\" thought Norman.\n\nHe logged on to the CineMovie rewards website, and clicked the \"sign up button\".

His coworkers were cordial with him, and he was back.  Judith, the new intern, cracked a joke he found quite amusing while taking his files.\n\nAs lunch approached, he considered his meal--leftover takeout from last night.

He placed the stuff on the table and proceeded to unpack. He put everything away except for the storage container and a box of cornflakes.\n\nNorman opened the cornflakes and took the plastic inner bag out of the packaging. To avoid making a mess he immediately threw the cardboard box in the bin. \"I won't be needing that anymore!\", Norman thought to himself. \"I have my new storage container now! The days of old, soft cornflakes are over! No more air will be allowed to meddle with my flakes!\"\n\nNorman snickered at his own waggishness. \"Let's give this bad boy a good wash before I put the cornflakes in!\", Norman said. Norman gave an affirmative \"meow!\" from the sofa. Norman turned on the tap. He wondered whether more people disliked the taste of food from a brand new container. \"Well, if they don't, they could surely give it a try sometime, and they will probably find it to be much better!\", Norman said. Norman did not meow anything. \"Or maybe not\", Norman thought.\n\nNorman dried off the container and set it down on the counter. He removed some soggy greens from the strainer and threw them in the rubbish. He washed and dried his hands thoroughly and grabbed the plastic bag of cornflakes. He carefully ripped it open and tilted it into the container. The flakes came sliding out, but Norman soon realised he'd made a mistake. There were too many cornflakes to fit the container.\n\nFor a moment Norman marvelled at his own idiocy. \"So stupid\", he thought, but he didn't say it. He didn't want Norman to hear. He figured his best course of action was to put only a part of the cornflakes in the container, and keep the rest of them separately. But Norman didn't want to keep them in just the plastic bag, which couldn't be properly closed. He needed the cardboard box to at least have a double wall.\n\nNorman went to grab the old box from the rubbish, but found it with soggy greens splattered all over it. \"Yuck!\", Norman said. \"Meow!\", Norman said, from the table this time. \"Get off the table Norman\", said Norman. \"Meow\", said Norman. Norman sighed, and looked at the plastic bag half full of cornflakes. \"I guess I have to eat them\", Norman said. \"Meow\", said Norman.\n\nAnd so he did, and skipped his dinner, and went to bed early feeling a bit sick. The next morning he did not have cornflakes for breakfast." }

He seemed to be hoping that someone would offer him one. \n\nThe conductor arrived and Norman showed him his ticket. The conductor was broad, and he took his time. He swayed with the motion of the train. It made him seem tired, physically tired. \n\n\"I need to show you this,\" the passenger said, once Norman had passed the conductor's scrutiny. \n\nThe conductor took the large sheet of paper that the other man held out, and made a low sound. Norman saw that it was handwritten, and had been stamped and dated. Half a minute passed. \n\n\"I don't do this.\"\n\n\"Excuse me?\" asked the passenger.\n\n\"Your train was cancelled, fine.

His new hope was never to be in the same situation as the man across from him now. You're more anonymous on a plane, you can make it so no-one can catch your eye, he thought. \n\n\"Well I didn't know that at the time, did I?\" the passenger was saying now. \n\n\"I can't kick you off, but you don't have a ticket and let me tell you: I *don't* have to be nice to you. I don't know why they always write that.\"\n\nThe passenger relaxed. Norman could not. He was imagining being the centre of attention. \n\n\"Sir, I'm supposed to be on the way to Philadelphia. Instead I'm here, because of the cancellation. I've had to change all my plans, and I won't see my girlfriend til Monday. I have a ten page form to fill out to get a refund. I've already had my day ruined once, and you're angry over this note, which I didn't write. The other conductor - \"\n\n\"I DON'T HAVE TO BE NICE TO YOU!\"\n\nThe passenger thought of a short remark, but held it back, and instead only smiled, slightly. \n\nIn the silence, there seemed to be more light, like on a stage. The conductor looked around, saw the faces of his audience, lost his momentum, felt the sway again. He was muttering now, moving away. \n\nThe passenger changed seats, to face the other direction.

Sorry about the trouble.\n\nYour Friend,\nGladys\n\nPS: Wiltshire says hello\n\n--\n\nBefore Norman could bring himself to question what \"exciting people\" meant, he felt a tingle of excitement. The morning paper was forgotten as Norman put an album on and settled into his recliner in the library to think. Who could he ask to play with him? In some distant corner of his mind Norman thought of Norman Jr., sitting across from him with a handful of cards as steam rises from a Styrofoam cup. Now that would be exciting.\n\nBack to reality, Norman thought to himself. Maybe the intern would want to come along? The intern, a quiet fellow who had just graduated from a prestigious university in his home country had once mentioned that he felt lonely. Yes, Norman thought to himself. He might appreciate an invitation. But would be know how to play? One way to find out.\n\nIt would be another ninteen minutes before the record finished and Norman, now sipping a weak cup of coffee, realized that he was still without his Sunday paper. Norman took the lift to the lobby and walked to the mail table. As he tucked the paper under his arm Gladys came into the building, fingers covered in dirt.\n\n\"Good morning, Gladys! I got your note - don't worry about a thing. I'll ask the office intern if he wants to play\". Norman hoped he didn't sound too eager that she was leaving. \"Have fun with your old friend!\"\n\nGladys smiled. Was that a pang of sadness Norman saw in Gladys' eye?\n\n\n" }

He would start at the crust, and work his way to the tip of the pizza slice.  He was concerned it would make a mess, so he had prepared a few napkins just in case.  Once the pizza was ready, and he had slipped a slice to Norman (because he had forgotten to feed him in all the excitement) he thumped onto the couch and carefully fed the pizza, crust first, into his mouth.  He got some sauce on his fingers from trying to hold the tip up, but that was okay, he had already prepared for that.  He felt a mildly calming sense of satisfaction wash over him as he ate the last bite, which also had a large pepperoni on it.

He went to sleep confidently, trying his best to make his eyes close without feeling dried after the ten hours of television he had just experienced. \n\nNorman had a wonderful dream, one that made sure to leave on a cliffhanger each time Norman's alarm went off, so Norman was in too deep with this dream-woman to have it end because of a goal to wake up at 9:30, or 10:30, or 11:30. By noon, Norman climbed out of bed, brushed his teeth, and turned on the television to see what the weather would be like for the day.\n\nIt was raining. \n\n*That doesn't do me any favors at all,* Norman pleaded to himself. The next channel was an episode of CSI mid-way through, so he finished it off before doing anything else, but it was also a two parter, so Norman made sure to watch the next hour as well.\n\nNorman turned his head towards the pile of dishes. Norman mercilessly turned his head back towards the television.\n\nBy the end of the day, Norman looked at the note on his night stand. He realized he accomplished none of the goals he had set for himself the night before. In embarrassment, Norman decided not to throw out the note, but to burn it. That way, no one would ever know that he set goals for himself that day. \n\n" }

It's just as good, and it should be OK for you\".\n\n\"Alright, I'll try it. Thanks\" said Norman fairly sheepishly. Mercifully, Lisa excused herself and walked away, leaving Norman to his work.\n\nWork was much the same as usual, and Norman stopped by the grocery store afterwards, as he did every Monday. He remembered Lisa's suggestion earlier and grabbed a small jug of almond milk and put it in his cart.

Earlier that morning, Norman turned on his phone for the first time in a week, to no surprise that no notifications were left behind. *As if nothing ever happened,* Norman thought. \n\n\nNorman ordered a maple flavored iced cappuccino and a sausage-and-egg muffin from a drive thru, and came to his office early, per usual. \n\n\nA stack of papers from the half week of work he missed waited on his desk, and Norman got to work.\n\nNorman thought about the haggard Hawaiian restaurant where Claire played footsie’s with him. It led to thinking about the hotel, and their night together. Norman squeezed his eyes shut, until the stars appeared. He forced himself to think about what he would be having for dinner. It didn’t matter what it was, so long as it overcame his thoughts. *I’ll be having chicken for dinner,* Norman stated, *with Sprite.* \n\n\nHe loved his wife dearly. Her affair took Norman by surprise, and after all was said and done, he couldn’t help but…\n\n*Stop,* Norman thought. He tried to remember which episodes of CSI were recorded over the week. He focused on his pencil, thinking about why HB2 could be so successful, to the point of pushing HB1 to extinction. One of the scavenger hunt items was a pencil, delivered to a historical-\n\nNorman snapped his pencil. Norman thought about if he were a different sort of man, that perhaps it would have been okay to stay with Claire. The husband would never find out, and perhaps she already had a plan to sleep with a stranger on the vacation, and if Norman didn’t do it, someone else would have. He didn’t want to think of Claire to be that sort of person. Norman could never be that man, not after spending so many years of being the man on the opposite side. He couldn’t wish this life on anyone, even if they would never affect his own life.\n\n\nNorman counted the tabs he had open on his computer, counting down until none were left, and then counting back up, until he surpassed the original number. He counted the change in his pocket, deciding if it was enough for both the parking fare and a bag of chips later tonight. He felt a sharper object in his pocket.\n\n\nNorman pulled a small turtle figurine out of his pocket, with the word *Waikiki* engraved on its belly. *I must have forgotten it from the scavenger hunt,* Norman thought.\n\n\n Back in his apartment is a shoe-box, filled with trinkets and memories, stretching all the way back to when he was a small boy. Good memories, some sad, but all things he’s cherished, and never wanted to forget. A baseball card. A hair-clip, a comb, a rusted coin. A wedding ring, some flattened flowers; drawings from his son.\n\n\nThe turtle would wait on the edge of his desk, near enough so that it would only take a flick or a misplaced glass of water to cause it to fall down into the wastebasket. It was a decision he would have to make someday. \n\n*Someday,* Norman thought. \n\n\nNorman went back to work.\n\n\n***\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bmCmb7TCso\n\nOnly took me a bloody year to finish writing this story.

He checked the clock and saw he still had thirty minutes to spare, and with a fresh shave and the tinge of his periodontal rinse still on his tongue, he decided it best to read to sleep. \n\nHe turned to his night table and beneath his nose plugs and water glass was that lovely old book he just got new with a red cover and an introduction by an author just as good as the one who wrote the book. \n\nHe skipped the foreword, tonight he wanted a story. He began reading, the first chapter a mundane recount of the past events in the character's life. By the second chapter things began to pick up. The main character, a retired astronaut, was being pressured to come back into work to guide some hotshot new astronaut who'd taken his place. \n\nNorman decided to press on through chapter three before setting it down. The junior astronaut meets his predecessor and they get into a ridiculous pissing match over microphysics and lunar modules. The head of the whole operation is trying to force them together to work for the good of the planet. One is ultimately useless without the other. \n\nChapter three ends on a cliffhanger. Norman can't sleep on it, he must read the fourth chapter. As one could probably guess by this point, Norman fell into the spell of a good book. Norman sat at the foot of the bed, waffling his tail and trying to stay awake as long as Norman was, but giving up when his eyes became heavier than thoughts. \n\nWith a warm cat to curl up with Norman was led on a journey through space and time. The federal government was the main antagonist, or really, the Secretary of Defense was. The astronauts band together and go to fight human-alien hybrids on a distant planet just now discovered. But to beat their common enemy, the defense secretary, the aliens must team up with the very astronauts they had previously despised. With a climactic scene taking place on the bridge of a nose protruding from an intergalactic Mount Rushmore, Norman flipped the last page and closed the book with finality. It was now 3:00am and he put a saucer of milk out should Norman wake ahead of him. \n\nAs Norman repositioned himself in bed, he appreciated the fact that as an adult he could choose to stay up all night should he find himself in an engaging book, and there was nobody to stop him. It was one of the first times Norman, already halfway through his life, grasped the meaning of the true autonomy of adulthood. \"And they say never buy books at the airport!\" Norman said, switching his light off and digging in his heels, anticipating another good book and another good day, several dreams from now.

Norman was sweating thinking of how to nicely ask Patrick for his co-worker's Pepto Bismol.

Norman giggled to himself but tried not to be audible. Patrick who was obviously concerned tried to talk to his co-worker through the stall. \"You alright in there Derrick?\" Patrick asked. Norman used this opportunity to sit in the empty stall next to Derrick. \n\nNorman could partially see under his stall. Derrick's feet were pointing outward with pain and strain. But there it was on the floor, Pepto Bismol the solution to his problem. How would he reach it? If he grabbed it Derrick would see and likely be upset.\n\nNorman decided it was time to stop playing around and get serious...but he couldn't grab it. He walked out of the bathroom and headed towards Derrick's  desk with intentions of taking a small sip of his Pepto Bismol. As he got closer he looked over to\nhis desk and noticed his files were untidy. \"Let me fix this before I go over there.\" He felt somewhat confident but needed to prioritize work.

The other problem comes from the fact that screenwriting is a terribly different monster than just prose. If you write something in, you *have* to figure out how it can be filmed, and filmed for the cheap.\n\nSo here's my proposal so far: I'm going to write a 5-10 minute short, and after the script is locked, I'll do the storyboarding and budget planning. Once I've figured out the bare minimum for the project, I'll start a kickstarter, and if we can hit the goal, we'll make the short. \n\nThat's a stretch, I know, who knows how many people will actually care to donate. I'm guessing now, with a project of this size, the minimum would be around 4,000 dollars. I've thought about stretch goals, and I've started to make moves towards some of them, and all I can say now is that if they work out, it'll be super, super cool. \n\nHere's the first draft of the script. I think it's impossible to capture every aspect of Norman, so I just focused on a few.\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/12o1w378hvzvyxm/Norman%20Short%20Film.pdf?dl=0\n\n\n\nThat's my pitch for now. And as for an update to the book, since I'm the same person working on that as well, I'm currently not touching it until the 15th- my last day of college. After that, there's not a whole lot left to do, and I can see me getting the final draft done in May. Then after that, I'll just be waiting for a review copy for myself.\n" }

There were lots of chairs that looked like his chair but each of them were slightly too different. \n\nNorman leaped off the armchair and trotted up to see what Norman was doing on the computer. \"Mewl,\" said Norman.\n\nNorman saw his opportunity and ran back to his armchair, pursued by Norman who jumped onto his lap.\n\nEveryone had the chair they wanted, for now." }

The hotel's continental breakfast was wonderful, Norman thought, and he considered returning to try the lunch buffet.

He crumbled the cookie down to a powder, making sure to fight the urges as he stayed true to a diet he started the week before. As he walked through his apartment hallway, just about to peel open the wrapper and read his fortune, Norman heard shouting. \n\nIt was Frank and Josie. As Norman neared their apartment door, the shouting grew louder, harsher, more explicit, and clear as day.\n\n*“You’re a fucking cunt, Josie! Always were! You gonna try to raise a cunt daughter?! Not on my watch! Don’t you fucking dare!”* \n\n*“You say this shit in front of her, and she’s going to end up fucking miserable like you! You’re a piece of shit!”*\n\nNorman could hear Amber in the room too, a wailing cry. It shook the walls. Norman choked on saliva as he struggled to swallow, his head throbbed in the burst of anxiety, his knees wobbled, and his fist hovered by the door, desperately hoping to gain the momentum and knock.\n\n\n*This is that slap in the face*, Norman thought. The fighting was relentless and it wouldn’t stop unless Norman did something. Norman would just have to knock, that’s all, and perhaps it wouldn’t solve anything, but at least it would stop the fighting. A simple knock on the door. He did it all the time. He wasn’t tired, wasn’t lazy, and he had no physical excuse in the world not to just do it. What if the knock wasn’t heard? What if they were so heavily in the throws of their fight that, no matter how hard he knocked, it wouldn’t be noticed? Norman had no excuse, none but the ones he gave himself, the moments of hesitation forming to something tangible. No one would hold Norman accountable if he didn’t say anything. He could still be at the Chinese restaurant, for all anyone cared. If  someone else came through the hallway, perhaps they could knock together. Anyone at all, *somebody else*. It would be safer that way. It would all end up okay.\n\nNorman unlocked the front door to his apartment. It was quiet, calm inside. A leftover pot of tea from the morning sat on the counter, and his cat slept soundly on the recliner, moving to a stretch as it became aware of Norman coming home. Norman changed into his cozies and turned on television, aimlessly flipping through the channels. He muted the television, and listened carefully. He couldn’t hear anything. He didn’t know if it was always this way, or if the fighting had stopped. He could hear stomping on the ceiling sometimes. The streets below often echoed honking horns through the cracked kitchen window. It wasn’t always this quiet. Things could be worse. \n\nNorman pulled the fortune cookie wrapper from his coat pocket, still filled with the crumbs and fortune inside. Norman pinched open the package and pulled out the paper.\n\n**“Two days from now, tomorrow will be yesterday.”** \n\n*Two days from now will be Friday*, Norman tried to joke with himself. Norman lifted the package upwards and poured the crumbs into his mouth. He didn’t forget about his diet, but he knew that one cookie wouldn’t have made that much of a difference anyways. A single cookie was the least of his worries.\n\n***\n\n[Click here for Part 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5upbzd/normans_chance_norman_frank_part_89/)\n" }

After his morning routine, he decided, he would head over to Mama’s Cafe. He finished getting ready, grabbed his Kangol, wallet, and keys, and headed out the door. It was a short walk to the cafe and he probably managed it twice a week now for at least a year. Opening the door, he was greeted with a smile by Theresa. “How’s the granddaughter, Theresa?” Norman asked with a friendly smile. A confused look passed over Theresa’s face, but then she responded, “Um, she’s fine, thanks.” Despite being a regular, apparently Theresa didn’t recognize Norman and she certainly didn’t seem to remember telling the table next to him about her granddaughter the last time Norman was in. Theresa asked if anyone was to be joining him today and Norman mumbled that it was just him.\n\n\nNorman sat at his table patiently, knowing already what he would like to eat- the usual toast and two eggs with a side of sausage. A few minute passed and Norman smiled amiably about, noting that the restaurant was a little slow, and wondering when a server would be by to take his order. It must have been about 15 minutes before his server, Angela, showed up to ask what he’d like to drink. Norman was a upset by Angela’s tardiness, but Norman always assumed the best of people so he didn’t remark on how long it had taken her to get to him and simply asked for a glass of orange juice and a glass of water. He was about to say that he was ready to order food, as well, but Angela had zipped off to grab his drinks before he could get a word out about it.\n\n\nMany more minutes passed with Norman’s mouth feeling dryer and dryer when Angela finally showed back up with his drinks and asked if was ready to order. Norman mumbled angrily under his breath “I’ve been ready for quite some time” but Angela didn’t seem to catch it. “I’m sorry?” She responded with a half smile, half look of confusion. Norman took a breath to steel himself and asked for his usual. “Oh, right, The Usual. Which is…?” Angela replied. Norman was certain that Angela was the same server that had helped him at least 3-4 times a month for the past several months, but again he let is pass and Norman gave his order while trying not to sound as annoyed as he was. Norman hoped Angela hadn’t noticed his tone of voice. He was constantly concerned that some spit would wind up in his food if he was anything but nice to servers. Angela just jotted down his order and was off again in a heartbeat.\n\n\nNorman sat there, contemplating everything that is wrong with the world. Today’s youth, Norman thought, have no manners. Can’t remember faces because their heads are always down looking at a screen. No one has basic manners anymore. Common courtesy was less and less common with every new generation, etc. etc. Norman was lost in thought about the woes of the world today when his food arrived. He hadn’t noticed a lot of time passing, but his food was luke warm by the time Angela set it on the table, topped off his water, and asked if he needed anything else. Norman just mumbled that he was fine and picked up his knife to spread butter and jam on his toast. Norman thought that the food would have been wonderful if it had arrived on time and hadn’t gotten cold by the time he was just half way through it. That was the last straw. Norman made his mind up to complain to the manager on the way out. Regulars weren’t supposed to have such bad experiences! They should be respected, remembered, and valued!\n\n\nWhen Norman was done with his meal and received his check, he marched toward the cashier at the front, mentally reviewing everything that had upset him. He paid his bill then asked to see a manager. A tired, grumpy looking gentleman came up front. “Yes?” asked the man, with a bit of a bark to his voice.  Norman thought the man was pretty rude for not introducing himself or shaking his hand. “Um, about the food…” Norman began. “Yeah, what about it?” The man barked again, cutting Norman off. Norman took note of the man’s hard stare and after a few moments Norman lost his nerve. “Uh, the food was great.” Norman finally spit out, “And so was the service.” Norman added hastily. He turned and walked quickly away before the man could yell at him. His heart was racing and he was sure he heard the man mumble something about wasting his time right before the door closed. Norman headed back home, breathing hard and realized when he got to his door that he left his keys on the table at the cafe. He decided to go to the park, and maybe check back at the restaurant for his keys after shift change." }

It was all swathes of color, vague notions of scenes in which the characters had forgotten their lines.\n  \nBut he couldn’t just give up.  Norman had dedicated this time to writing his dream down!  Come on, man, *think*!\n\nThe dream… yes, the dream was split into two halves.  The first half was orange, green, blue… a log across a stream, acting as a bridge.  Bright, sunny walls… rock faces, like a canyon.  There was a person there.  No, not a person.  More like, like a thing that *imitated* people.  It took the concept of a person, and mimicked that, but lacked the small details that made people… individuals.  And, and it came in and out of the dream, like a ghost, phasing through dimensions.  When it phased in and out like that, this thing, was it blinking in and out of existence, or going somewhere else in Norman’s mind?\n\nIn the second half of his dream, Norman met… his own cat, Norman!  Only Norman: The Cat was Norman: A Person, and running for mayor.  They bumped into each other in the busy hallway of a ski-lodge, which was lined with metal lockers, each about the size of a shoebox and painted grey.  Norman asked Norman For Mayor what he thought about tax-funded public art.  Norman For Mayor didn’t say anything; instead nodding politely as he contorted his body and stuffed himself into one of the lockers, so that all that stuck out was a foot. \n \nIt was only while writing it all down that Norman realized that someone running for mayor in a busy ski-lodge hallway would probably be in a hurry, and not have time for questions.  \n\nHe left it at that, set the pen down, and sighed.  Why did he do this?  The sound of soft purring crept up from the floor, and Norman looked down to see Norman The Cat rubbing against his leg.  Norman lifted the cat up and, smiling, said, “You’d make a pretty good mayor, if they let you run.”  Norman smiled back.\n" }

Even though the day wasn't a rainy one, it was just a bit cloudy.  Norman stood in the kitchen and almost sighed.  After triple checking that Norman had ample supply of cat food in his dish, he set off to have his own meal. A few minutes later as Norman was washing the dish in the sink, he suddenly felt a burst of joy as he remembered today was the first day of the month! \"I can change my calendar!\" Quite obviously, Norman had to finish cleaning before he could rush off, but he couldn't help but dry the dish wearing a smile on his face.\n\nAs he cleaned, Norman wondered what next month's picture would be in the calendar. As much as he wanted to, he hadn't peaked ahead before it was time. Norman would surely miss March's tiger striped cat, but April deserved a turn. \"Maybe it'll be a fluffy white cat.\" He mused. \"Or a black one\" Norman quite enjoyed guessing. He was so distracted by thoughts of the calendar, that his hands fumbled and he almost dropped the dish he was holding! \"That would've broken for sure!\" Norman exclaimed. \"I must be more careful in the future.\" He scolded himself \"curiosity can kill the cat.\"  \n\nAfter the whole kitchen fiasco, Norman stood in front of the wall where the calendar hung, and said goodbye to March. He excitedly held his breath and flipped the page to April. The picture was of a tiny brown kitten. \"I never would've guessed!\" Norman was absolutely surprised but pleased. He pinned up the page and grabbed a pen. \"Better get a pencil\" Norman realised. Carefully, he wrote in his dentist appointment time for the 10th. He simply couldn't wait to write in it again. \"At least I have the end of the day to look forward to.\" Norman thought \"Then I can draw a big 'X' for the finished day!\" Suddenly, the sun shined through the window, and Norman's day seemed a whole lot brighter." }

Norman reflected on his activities through the day.  He had arrived at work a few minutes early, just enough to avoid the traffic his later colleagues always complained about, but not by enough to avoid driving past a few stopped cars that had apparently collided.  Even now, as he prepared to leave the office, Norman felt a twinge of guilt that he hadn't stopped to help.  *They were standing around and inspecting the damage,* he told himself again, *and it didn't look severe at all.*  He didn't want to be late for work, or worse, contribute to another accident by behaving unpredictably on the road.\n\nHe adjusted his tie, wishing his manager had told him that it would be unnecessary.  He'd had an interview that morning--an unexpectedly-informal \"meet and greet\" with an applicant for a team that Norman worked with somewhat regularly.  This new guy, Jesse, had big shoes to fill, Norman thought; Marie had her documentation process down to a science.  Norman had often asked her for help with his own work on occasion.  He doubted Jesse would be as helpful.  (But, he had to admit, Jesse would be more effective than a vacant position.)\n\nThe rest of Norman's morning had been spent sorting emails.  One of those networking sites had sent him quite a few messages about openings at nearby offices.  He wondered if it was true that he could get a pay increase by switching companies... But his benefits were very good, and last year the company bought him a new, more ergonomic chair.  It was quite comfortable, once he'd broken it in a bit.  He deleted the notifications.\n\nAt lunch, Norman had planned to meet Lisa at the diner across the street, but when he arrived, he found a text from earlier in the day saying that her boyfriend had made last-minute plans, so she couldn't make it.  His usually-social lunch was much quieter and much quicker than usual, so he popped over to the shops for a few minutes.  It was nice, he decided, to stretch his legs a bit during the lunch break.  Perhaps he would join one of those office walking groups.  He was going to pass the pet shop when he remembered that his cat hadn't received a Valentine's present.  That wouldn't do!\n\nNorman didn't want to take too long picking out a toy, but he felt certain Norman was sick and tired of all the same mouse and bird toys over and over.  He was about to give up when he spotted the perfect choice.  He chuckled to himself at his joke, and took his items to the checkout.\n\nThe afternoon was uneventful.  Many of his coworkers left early, leaving Norman and only a few others in the large space.  Norman liked his coworkers, but he enjoyed the solitude as well.  He felt very efficient in the quieter office, and wished that he had just a little more work to do.\n\nDuring his downtime, he checked on the delivery status for the flowers he'd bought.  The online tracker reported that they were delivered to a person at his ex-wife's house.  He smiled, hoping she was the one who had received them.  She had chastised him for buying her flowers the first few times he did it, but either she had decided to enjoy them as he intended, or to ignore them.  He preferred to imagine the former, especially since he started signing them Norman Jr.  He knew Junior didn't have the spending money, but Norman felt like it was a nice gesture that his son would make, given the opportunity.\n\nNow, after writing down a brief account of his daily activities, Norman was finally ready to leave the office.  He removed his tie the moment he got outside, and drove home with it piled in the passenger seat, next to the bag from the pet shop.  He was relieved to see both vehicles from that morning were gone.\n\nWhen he got home, he went inside before remembering his tie and Norman's new toy, and had to run back out to his car for them.  \"Norman!\" he called.  \"I've got a present for you!\"  Norman lifted his head and sniffed, uncertain what his human's excitement was about.\n\nNorman brought the bag over to his cat, and pulled out two items.  \"Now we can end the day together, buddy!\"  He scratched the cat's head, and then put the new collar--a bow-tie collar!--around Norman's neck.  \"I took mine off early, but I won't make you wear this one very long,\" Norman commented with a smile.  \"And here's your drink!\"  He presented a stuffed wine bottle to Norman, who rubbed his cheek on it before allowing his human to place it next to him on the couch.\n\nNorman went to the fridge and got his leftovers ready for dinner, then grabbed a beer and went to sit on the couch with the cat.  He turned on the TV, and looked over at his feline buddy.  Norman was curled up with the wine bottle.  Norman decided that this was a very good day." }

He grabbed all the things that he would need and left.\n\nWhen Norman got to the café, he saw a small line while in line, he looked at the menu. His gaze immediately drifted to the classic muffin.

His briefs had become twisted during the night and were uncomfortable, so he slumped out of bed, slid on a pair of socks and plodded into the bathroom.\n\nNorman picked his electric razor up and lowered it again when he looked in the mirror. With a finger, he prodded at the limp flesh beneath his chin, his shoulders slumped forward. With two hands now, he tucked the fatty paunch away out of sight and examined his face for a moment. Norman left the bathroom and returned with a roll of sticky tape. He snapped a piece of tape off and wrapped it under his chin as though it were a strap for a bicycle helmet. A few more pieces of tape here and there and Norman was able to see his whole neck again. The bathroom light glinted off the glossy tape, ruining the illusion, so Norman sighed and removed the tape which was a painful affair.\n\nHe looked in the mirror again, now at the red marks on his face from the sticky tape then smiled and shook his head.

(Lefty and Clarissa. Derrik flattered himself 'quaint.')\n\nEver since he took his bus seat, Norman abstractly dreaded the notion of someone sitting down next to him, and this encounter was a prime example of why.\n\nIt must have been forever and six months, by Norman's reckoning, and it wasn't his stop yet.\n\nBefore his mind could be cluttered further by increasingly-personal details of Derrik's daily routine, Norman resolved to find something else to occupy his attention – a decision he would come to regret almost immediately. His wandering gaze latched upon a drooping bit of saliva navigating its way down Derrik's chin. It was a large droplet, glistening, heavy – did Derrik really not notice it? He must have. *Surely I must say something,* Norman thought, but the very idea of broaching the subject filled him with that familiar sensation of abstract dread.\n\nIt wasn't Norman's stop yet.\n\nNorman lost the thread of the conversation. It became evident that all he really needed to do was nod occasionally, and Derrik was content to rattle away. Norman felt a pang of guilt, perfectly aware that he was being at least somewhat rude, and put in a half-hearted effort to re-immerse himself in the tidal wave of inconsequential anecdotes flooding out of Derrik's mouth, but kept finding his perceptions drawn instead deeper and deeper into that large and ponderous bead of saliva.\n\nThere were worlds, galaxies spinning inside that bead. It shined, star-filled, with every passing street-light. Norman has identified and named ten constellations, and it still wasn't his stop yet.\n\n*It must fall off of his chin at some point,* Norman thought. He'd look away, but he couldn't – he was, ostensibly, in a conversation. *If the bead would fall off, I'm sure he'd notice, and wipe his face. I could stop looking at it.* But the saliva clung tenaciously to Derrik's face. It would wobble occasionally; Each time, Norman was filled with hope, and mild disappointment as it refused to move further.\n\nDerrik became angry about something. The change in tone prompted Norman's attention. It appeared that Derrik convinced himself that Norman was a supporter of some political party or other, a notion Derrik found concretely distasteful. His tone got louder, his gestures more wild, the flow of saliva from his mouth increased. Norman helplessly watched as Derrik worked himself into enough of an upset fervor that he got up and found another seat across the aisle. Time resumed, but inconveniently slowly, delayed by Norman's feelings of guilty anxiety at having been misunderstood and yelled at.\n\nNorman's stop came. Before he left the bus, he cast a last, mildly apologetic look at Derrik. In that moment, the drop of saliva came tumbling down. Derrik noticed, and wiped his face.\n\nAlthough Norman quickly forgot Derrik's name, everything about him, and that they even met at all, the profound sense of relief he felt at that moment would keep him reasonably chipper for most of the rest of the day." }

It’s a boy. Mom and baby are both healthy” the nurse said. “Follow me.” \n\nA sense of excitement welled up in Norman as he began to follow the nurse to meet his son for the first time. As he exited the waiting room he glanced back once more at the father and son, and sent a silent thank you for calming his nerves. \n\n------------\n\nThe fond memory faded from Norman’s mind and focused back on the present. Norman couldn’t help but think of how difficult the past year had been for he and his family. He went from coming home to a wife and son, to a cat and an empty one-bedroom apartment. In spite of it all, he was still proud of being a father – his greatest accomplishment. \n\nJust then, Norman knew exactly what to say. He opened the card and wrote: *Happy Birthday, Son.

Without meaning to, he had found himself slipping into a state of mind of which he did not often venture into often, for good reason. “What are my greatest accomplishments in life? Norman wondered. “where am I going from here”? He thought of that one time he single hand-idly wiped out all of the flies in the office in the span of an afternoon. Sighing glumly, Norman realized that this was not the kind of accomplishment he was looking for. As the bus neared the stop nearest to Normans single bedroom home, he slowly rose off of the cracked, dusty seat. \nLater that night, Norman lay in bed after a long day of typing up financial council and report forms. Spying a lone stranger walking the sidewalk outside, he thought back to the conversation he had had with Tau-Lu about refilling the ink cartridges in the printer when they ran out. Several co-workers always forgot to refill the printer, and that small hiccup in the smooth, bland day irked Norman. However, he was able to quickly move on from the interruption, and continue in his arduous but important task of typing up reports. Resuming work was a comfort for Norman, something he liked to think about when trying to fall asleep.\n\n\t\nAt precisely 6:35 AM, Norman stepped unto his regular bus route, and walked to the back of the bus, adjusting his broken glasses as he went. Norman had bent the frame of his glasses two months prior, after falling unto the metal floor of the bus. He had never gone to get them repaired, as he did not want to break his schedule unless necessary. Doing so is never comfortable.  Norman sat in the same seat every day, twice a day. Everyone on the bus line knew that the second-most aisle seat to the back was to be used twice a day, every day, by Norman. After a short trip to the corporate office, Norman ascended the elevator swiftly, arriving on time. Norman was greeted by glances, and a few whispered “hello’s” from the HR department as he passes by on the way to his cramped office. Checking the printer machine outside of the door labeled “NORMAN”, he was pleased to note the ink cartridge was nearly full, a welcome surprise. Norman shuffled into the small office, moving the chair back slightly to make room for the door to be opened. Sitting down, Norman pulled up his e-mail account. Already he could see a few spam e-mails addressed to him. Most came from the travel agency a few cities away, of which Norman made the mistake of breaking his normal schedule to go visit. He was less than thrilled with the prospect of travel after seeing all of the smiling hordes of people on the brochures, and left the brightly colored office with haste, to resume his schedule. But one email caught his eye. It was different for the rest. Norman took a small, calculated risk, and opened the email. Inside was a block of text inviting him to a new group therapy session beginning this Tuesday, and continuing once a week. Norman gave it a small amount of thought before deciding that it was not for him, and sending the email to the trash bin, to be deleted every thirty days with all other threads and spam he had no use for.\n\nLoping awkwardly out of the large office building with his worn briefcase, Norman hopped onto the bus. But not his usual line. Today was Tuesday, and after several days of thought, he had decided to attend the therapy session after work. It pained him to set aside his schedule, but with some healthy reasoning, Norman decided that the session could not do any harm. As a plus, he wouldn’t have to be around all of the people in the group for very long before he had to return home to rest before work the next day. Norman ambled to the back of the bus, only to find a large woman wearing a flower print dress and sun hat sitting in his usual seat. Norman slunk unhappily to the other side of the aisle. Already he knew that taking the time out of his schedule for this was a bad idea. 25 minutes later, Norman had arrived at the grand entrance to the “Samson and Koch Center for Mental Well-Being”. The name was too long, in Normans opinion. It was loud and bold, and took up a large amount of the front of the bricks above the doors. Norman sighed deeply as he walked in, noticing already a circle of chairs, 85% filled. Shuffling to the circle, he glanced suspiciously at the people on either side of his chair. They looked fairly innocuous, so Norman took a seat, glad not to be under judgment and scrutiny.\n\nAlready he felt out of place in his formal work attire, as most of the people here seemed to be men in their 20s – 40s who smelled strongly of alcohol and marijuana, and who looked decidedly unpleasant. The other half of the group looked to be made up of single mothers, a few of whom had to bring their small children along out of the need for a babysitter, but no money to pay one. “If all goes well”, thought Norman, “I may be able to leave without having to speak much”. Much later, after the sun had sunk into the horizon, Norman reflected on his life once more. He decided everything was just fine, for now.\n" }

Norman wanted to show his son how he too could be current. So he ordered a new chair about three weeks ago, which was longer than the given two and a half weeks for arrival. He was anxious to get it. While sitting in his old sofa recliner petting Norman, he dialed the number to the chair company. He waited anxiously while the phone rang, and was pleased when it was picked up on the fourth ring, and not on the third. Norman had a small distaste for odd numbers. He explained the situation to them calmly, and then chuckled to himself when they repeated the address. They had mistaken one of the numbers in his address for one of the house's across his street. The chair company told Norman they would correct the problem, and bid him a good day. Norman was happy that the chair would be coming soon, and continued to sit in his aged seat petting Norman; CSI would start soon." }

But there had been a lot of catching up work to be done with the extended holiday weekend the week before. It was Thursday, and 11:59am, and Norman thought he had earned a treat for himself and was going to go on his lunch hour a minute early. He reminded himself to leave a minute later at the end of the day to make up for it.     \n\nNorman went down to the cafeteria, even though he wasn't buying any food from down there. A couple of the tables were quietly occupied, and at one sat Kyle with a couple other people from the marketing department. Kyle was telling a story, and laughing loudly. The laugh was always the same volume and duration, no matter the quality of the joke, Norman thought as he attempted to walk by to a far table in the corner.    \n\n\"NORMAN!\" Kyle bellowed, a smile on his face. Norman slowed in front of their table. \"We NEVER see you down here!\"    \n\nBefore he could answer, Kyle held the bag of potato chips he had been eating from up to Norman, \"Chip?\"    \n\nNorman thought for a moment and throwing caution to the wind decided just one. As he reached in though, he realized there weren't too many chips left, and Kyle was holding the bag in such a way that he couldn't quite get his finger and thumb properly in to grab just one chip. What felt like an eternity passed by as Norman struggled for a grip. He felt the eyes of the marketing folks upon him, even though one was absentmindedly scrolling through his phone. He wasn't sure if Kyle could feel the length of time, but he was attempting to remain calm without seeming like he was blaming Kyle for the grip on the bag. It was Norman's lack of foresight, after all.   \n\nQuickly and suddenly, his finger and thumb settled on two different chips and managed to bring them both to the surface. His panic faded into guilt. He'd only been offered one and was now unsure of what to do, but Kyle was already saying something about letting him know what he thought about the flavors, as there was some sort of contest going on.     \n\nNorman though was lost in thought as he walked away to his table. He now had nowhere to put this second rogue chip, and he certainly wasn't going to eat both at once, not with this mystery flavor going about.

It was in the lobby of the apartment complex, with a long draped curtain separating the front desk clerk and mailboxes from the washing machines and driers. Norman didn’t mind waiting in the designated seating area, as it gave him plenty of time to contemplate what he would rather be doing once he returned to his home. Norman day-dreamed about what sort of day-dreaming he would do back in the comfort of his recliner, a cat in his lap and a tea in hand.\n\nNorman was caught mid-smile as the curtain was pushed open, a small head peeking through, looking square at Norman. Soon the head disappeared back into the fold, and Josie, Frank’s wife, entered the room with a basket of laundry. The little girl followed closely, wary of Norman in the corner.\n\n“Norman, right?” Josie said as she loaded the laundry into a machine. “I didn’t realize you lived in the building too.”\n\n“Yes, I live just a few doors down from you.” Norman said matter of factly, in a certain way that made it hard for Josie to continue a conversation. She nodded, inserting fifty cents into the machine. \n\n“I’m sorry about that night,” Norman started, “I usually don’t drink. It was a special occasion.”\n\n“Not for Frank…” Josie retorted. “I’m sorry too, I suppose. I was just angry at my husband. It was his birthday and Amber here made him a cupcake and… Sometimes I wish he was just more considerate.”\n\nNorman shook his head in agreement. Amber busied herself with the candy dispensers, checking to see if anything had been forgotten.\n\n He thought about the promise he had made to himself that night; to save Frank’s marriage. It seemed so silly in hindsight, and now, speaking to a reasonable and not at all villainous Josie, Norman was even less certain of what he could do. \n\n***\n[Click here for Part 7.](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5uga14/normans_second_chance_norman_frank_part_79/)" }

He continued to listen to the commercials even though he could have easily pressed the 30 seconds button a few times, but since he wasn't a patron he felt he would be cheating the makers of the podcast. He had heard all the ads before, but today there was a new one. \n    \n \"Hey guys I've had the same glasses for years. Partially because I hate shopping and I have no clue what is fashionable. But earlier this week I was introduced to Warby Parker. They sent me 5 pairs of glasses of the trendiest glasses all for under $100 dollars. With a 1 week return policy if I was not satisfied. Of course I have to admit I was impressed and now have a new pair of glasses that get complimented almost every day.\" \n     \n  Norman could not  help, but be intrigued by this offer. He was in a very relatable situation to his favorite podcaster. He liked to imagine they would be good friends. His calm never over zealous voice matched Norman's temperament and their  frugal behaviour seemed to be akin. And of course Norman hated shopping too. Norman thought about how he had the same glasses since he had last went shopping with his ex-wife she really seemed to like them, but no other women had ever complimented them. He went to work and mulled this offer. A week later after Norman had heard and renegotiated this offer multiple times. He gave in to the excitement of this investment. \n\nThe package arrived. He decided for every week day he would wear a different pair of glasses. The first day of work that week his heart was pounding as he entered his office. Luckily no one noticed. The next day again no one seemed to notice or didnt care. He was relieved, but perplexed he had spent his money too frivolously to garner some attention right? The next day his cubical neighbor Stan  mentioned his glasses and even complimented them. Though Norman was flattered those glasses wouldn't do either. That was not the attention he wanted (he only wanted attention from the fairer sex). The fourth day he saw Lisa for the first time this week (just now realising this, he had been so focused on his experiment). She didn't notice his big change; he was losing hope. \n\nThe last day he questioned if he shouldn't even risk trying the last pair, but since he had ordered it. He felt obligated to try all the glasses or else he would be lying, when he returned the glasses. He wouldn't know if the last pair would have satisfied him or not. Norman's moral obligations almost always out weighed his fears. (He would always return a strangers wallet unless they looked like a thug or were scarily large in which he would drop it off at the police station) The last day of the work week. He hoped no one had noticed this last change he was almost home free. How stupid wasting a $100 dollars, when he had a perfectly fine pair all along he thought. At the end of the day in rare occurence he saw Lisa as he was about to enter his car. She was about to enter her's. In all the clamity of the week he didn't even realise he had parked next to her, which he usely avoided so he didn't seem like he was desperate for her attention. \n   \"Hey I Norman. I just wanted to say I like your new glasses.\" Said Lisa bashfully.\n     Norman smiled and thanked her. Then entered his car and proceeded home. He looked at his self in the mirror and thought I guess my ex-wife was right. He returned the Warby Parker glasses the next Monday." }

Sure, when witnessing a murder his gut would still sink and his palms would still sweat, but it had been years now since he had thrown up.\n\nBut this was different. It marked the very first time he himself had committed murder. Technically manslaughter, but it still counted. And most frightening of all? He found it exhilarating. His heart raced. Adrenaline pumped through him. He had a sudden first-hand understanding of so many rap lyrics, and he felt cooler for it.\n\nThen came the guilt, hitting hard and fast like a speeding cab at a virtual intersection. He had to lie down.\n\nQuestions flooded his mind. Why did he have to hit *her*? An old man stood just to the left.

He wouldn't have liked that at all.\n\nWith a whimpering sigh it dawned on him: this woman probably had a family back home who would miss her. Was she a mother? Did she have friends? Was there a favourite food she would never taste again? Just then Norman crawled onto Norman’s lap, and Norman thought, “Oh no! What if she has a cat who will never snuggle her again!?”\n\nIt was all too much.\n\nAs he pondered the digital woman’s life, he heard sirens slowly growing louder on his TV screen.

He would see people unpacking their shopping, talking with their family as they got home, or most often just undulating light reflecting off the walls as people watched their TV’s.

I should come into the back yard more often.* The tree had many branches which looked rather climbable and Norman could see a fairly straightforward path up the tree to the bathroom window. *Am I really considering this?* Norman had not climbed a tree since he was young. He remembered getting stuck up a tree once and after that he had never climbed again. But by now his stomach was eating itself and CSI was due start so it had to be done. Norman, slowly but surely, edged his way up the tree, testing every foothold before trusting his weight to it. *How embarrassing*, he thought as he crawled along the final branch on his belly, *I hope the neighbours don’t see me!* Finally he was at the bathroom window and able to slither through headfirst, landing his hands and then his feet safe on the bathroom floor.

Norman stretched and climbed onto Norman’s legs, turned around once to curl into a ball and relaxed into his lap.

It’s daylight savings today; I hope you had a good day,” he scritched him behind his ears.\n\nNorman didn’t know what that meant but he felt the golden glow of lights and the TV flickered up on the walls. Norman did not think other people’s routines must be as good as his, although he did wonder why everything was an hour later today as he settled into sleep.\n" }

In the morning they would say “Morning” to each other, and as they packed up their briefcases for the day, they would say “Evening”, even though both of them left the office at the same time, ride the elevator at the same time, and even wait at the bus stop at the same time.

Occasionally he would hear Frank discuss politics with Robert from sales, and from the amount of times Frank ordered in for lunch, Norman could tell he was a fan of Vietnamese food. Norman also knew that Frank had a wife named Josie, and an eight year old daughter named Amber. Norman felt that this was his one connection to Frank, if the two ever talked. Norman and his ex-wife divorced when Junior was only seven, and because of that, Norman was jealous of Frank.

Please take a moment in your day to wish him Happy Birthday!”\n***\n\nNorman hesitated. He quickly closed the email, just in case Frank saw it. It would spoil any surprise birthday parties, if anyone had happened to plan one for him. Norman then had to consider his options- say Happy Birthday to his face and risk stumbling over his words, or write a carefully worded, but less thoughtful, email? \n\n“Hey Norman,” said Frank as he swung his chair around, “it’s my birthday.”\n\n\n“Oh really? Happy-birday,” Norman slurred unconvincingly. He wished that Frank had said that to him in an email instead. \n\t\n“Since it’s Friday, I’m looking for someone to get drunk with tonight.

Norman would never had let his son engage in such douchbaggery.\n\nFeeling even more inflamed, Norman flicked the light switch. Adjusting his eyes to the bright burning, he clumsily scrabbled for the phonebook on the pedestal, next to the phone. He sat on the occasional chair and flicked through the pages. There. Under the Ns, he found 'noise control'. \n\nHolding his finger to the spot on the page, Norman reached for the phone. He pressed in the first few numbers, and froze. He erased them quickly. What had he been thinking? What a spoilsport. They were just kids having some fun. \n\nNorman smiled and closed the phone book, placing it neatly on the pedestal. \n\nBut then again, wasn't he just as entitled to enjoyment (sleep) as they were? They had had their fun.\n\nNorman opened the phone book again and pressed 'back' on his phone. He continued typing in digits, and was just about to press call, when a sudden realisation hit him.\n\nWhat if they somehow found out it was him who put a stop to their party? \n\nHe could see it now. A bunch of dangerous hooligans, sneaking across the lawn. 'Let's do a skux on his porch' they'd say, and they would. Disgusting.\n\nHe shuddered and closed the phonebook. The stakes were too high. Norman could do without sleep tonight. Before turning off the light, he wrote 'ear plugs' on his jotter.\n" }

He'd just played a energetic round of tennis with his neighbor whom he didn't intend to keep in touch with should he ever move away. \n\n\"I better fix dinner before I get comfortable.\" Norman decided, heaving himself up to a standing position. He opened his refrigerator and stood back. \"Nothing to eat in here. It's too full.\" He closed the door and thought a moment. He wondered in his head \"Do I want a whole meal or would a well choreographed snack be sufficient? I guess I did have an early lunch.\" Norman opened his freezer and found two perfectly good options. Half a box of fish sticks or a frozen pizza with pesto and sun-dried tomatoes. He settled on the fish sticks, since they were open. He read the directions and turned the knob to preheat his oven for the specified 325 degrees Fahrenheit. \n\nNorman returned to his favorite spot in the couch, where he'd left a \"comfort\" indentation, to wait for the oven to warm. Just as he was about to sit, it occurred to him, he'd been out of town last weekend. So the fish sticks may be older than he originally expected. He checked the expiration date, and sure enough, they'd turned two days prior. He put his textured slippers on and tossed the box in the outside trash so they wouldn't emanate a fishy odor in thawing in the kitchen trash. He returned and went about putting the pizza in the oven. Fortunately the pizza was also to be cooked at 325 degrees, so no further manipulation of the oven was required. \n\nFinally situated on the couch, he flipped the TV on to channel 12 ice hockey. Or at least, he tried to. The remote wouldn't turn on the television. He tried aiming it at different spots of the TV. He took his cable box out of the cabinet so it was visible to the remote. When that didn't work he finally, begrudgingly, went to the supply drawer at the other end of the room to find a D battery and screwdriver with which to change it. \n\nHe made a note on his pad to buy more D batteries as he returned to the couch. But the battery change was futile. \"I'm sure I still have that warranty card somewhere.\" Norman thought as he gritted his teeth. After searching through old receipts he recovered the manual and purchase agreement which held the warranty code. He located the 1-800 number on his cable box and went through the touch tone menu, then was placed on a brief hold. They played a pleasant mix of muzak and light rock whilst he waited. \n\nWhen an operator came on, he described the issue and the steps he'd taken to troubleshoot it. The operator, who claimed his name was \"Pat\" but was definitely born with a name closer to \"Indrajit\", was mild mannered but efficient. He asked Norman for his zip code, which he provided. He was then placed on another hold to the tune of a pop song which he cared for less than the previous selection. \n\nPat returned a minute later. \"Norman, I am pleased to inform you that EveryTown cable will be able to replace your remote at no extra charge as you are within your warranty expiry date. You can have it shipped to you or you may pick it up at any of our partner stores such as Best Buy or Radio Shack. In the meantime you will find all the regular remote functions are accessible through manual buttons on your cable box. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you, and would like to credit your account $25 to be put towards your next cable bill.\" Norman thanked them for their assistance and arranged to have the new remote shipped to him. He declined expedited shipping as he was going out of town again soon, and wanted to be home to receive the package. \n\nHe hung up the phone and, using a hot pad, removed his pizza from the oven. Transferring it to a plate he sat down to watch his ice hockey game. The pizza was a bit undercooked but Norman had already turned off the oven and decided it was fine as it was. " }

Is that you?” Norm’s face paled over as his fears seemed to manifest in front of him, in the form of this tall, irritable woman asking a name he had no recollection of.\n\n“You know you’re late for work don’t you?”\n\nNorman could only compose himself enough to shake his head. Still, she pressed:\n\n“You were supposed to clock in like, three hours ago Mike.”\n\n“Well…yea, but this isn-“\n\n“You’re lucky I found you.” She began walking with his arm folded firmly into hers, dragging him along the way a nun might perhaps drag a child. And like that child, Norman felt completely powerless to stop her taking him; at once doing both his best to pry away and remain concealed from any onlookers, less they too see his morphed mug and mistake him for that stranger Michael Yeng.\n\nShe was doing her best to keep him moving. They had crossed the street and were heading toward “Double Buns and Burgers” restaurant. Norman began considering the possibility that perhaps Mike hijacked his life on purpose, perhaps to get away from this pushy, fair-faced table-jockey kidnapping him. The woman reached for the door and helped push Norman inside.\n\n“Ok Mike, l’ll tell Jessup your bus caught a flat on the way, that I caught you walking to work. Here’s an apron-you can thank me later honey”\n\nShe went to the backroom. Meanwhile, Norman just stood blankly, clutching at his apron. He gazed over the food-counter, over the stoves and the dining area. His eyes fixed, unblinking, watching each employee in action: the cashier assisting customers, the cooks grilling burgers and chopping vegetables, the janitor pulling a mop and bucket into the bathroom; each and every one wearing that fat, eggshell-colored countenance that he had so carefully studied just after this morning’s concussion. All of them, save not one, wearing the same face as if it were part of their uniform. All wearing the mask of Michael Yeng. \n" }

He rarely felt anything at all beyond a nagging emptiness inside his bones. In all the years of his life, the only thing that came close to filling it was her. He used her for it.. Filling himself of her and everything she gave him, then selfishly discarding her because he knew he couldn't do the same for her. Not because he didn't love her, but the constant aching inside of him left him constantly trying to appease his own consciousness, and this left very little time for her.\nShe cried a lot. This made him sad, but a disconnected faucet cannot leak. So he yelled at her.\n\n\n*Why was* **she** *crying?

Usually, he would just have leftovers, but he was going on his third day of chicken and it was starting to be less appetizing with each passing day.  He needed something different, but what?\n\nSlowly he wandered up and down the aisles, looking for anything that might strike his fancy.  Frozen dinner?  A sandwich from the deli?  Nothing was really sticking out.  He took out his kerchief and wiped the sweat from his brow.  It had been very warm lately and he had parked so far away that he built up a sweat on the way into the store.  Hot weather always reminded Norman of his love for BBQ.  \"That's it\" he thought, \"I'll grill up a juicy steak for dinner!\"\n\nNorman hurriedly shuffled to the meat department, eager to peruse the fine selections.  A delicious looking T-Bone caught his eye.  It was his favorite cut, and this one had beautiful marbling.  Alas, a look at the price tag reminded Norman that he was on a tight budget.  Eventually Norman arrived at the end of the display, where the discounted meats were sold.  He found a New York Strip that was 50% off.  Upon closer inspection, the steak was getting close to the end of its shelf life, and what was once a bright red steak was now gray in spots, and had a silvery sheen when held at an angle.  It was still good, and would fit Norman's needs.\n\nUpon arriving at home, Norman cleared the spiderwebs from his trusty charcoal grill (an old Weber he found on Spring Clean Out Day in his old neighborhood).  A quick scrub on the rusty grate with a well-worn steel brush, a fair amount of lighter fluid on the store brand charcoal briquettes, and soon blue smoke poured forth.\n\nWhile the coals were getting hot, Norman prepared his steak.  He had already poked holes in his potato, and it was slowly turning in the microwave.  He cut the Saran Wrap and drained the blood into his sink.  There was a little bit of slime, but a good scrubbing under cold water helped that.  \n\nNow that it was clean, Norman could see that there wasn't as much marbling as he liked.  Reaching into a drawer, Norman pulled out his meat tenderizer, the spiked hammer he had found at the church rummage sale 3 years ago.  Covering the steak with foil, Norman began to beat his meat furiously, breaking down the connective tissue.   A dash of salt and pepper (from the shakers you see at picnics with cobs of corn printed on the side), and the steak was ready to cook.  \n\nPlacing the tenderized steak on the searing hot grill, Norman took pleasure in hearing the sizzle.  Summer was almost here, and he looked forward to sunny days ahead." }

Resting on top of the tallest hill, its residents saw the long and narrow valley below, and far off in the distance, on the other side of the valley, were tall mountain peaks whose high tips were touched by snow of the purest white. It was a rather large neighborhood, and beautiful, nearing 2000 acres of land with some of the most opulent houses money could buy. Most of them were two stories in height, with complementing colors and intricate details and boasting large and pretty gardens cultivated by masterful gardeners. There were grand exceptions though; one in particular was the house that belonged to Doctor Eugen. To call it a mere house would be a misidentification. Truly it was a mansion that towered four stories tall and was surrounded by a proper field with a hedge maze, olympic sized swimming pool, game court, and garden. A big garden. Every day Doctor Eugen would get in his black Phantom Rolls Royce and drive to work. There was a smooth, dark road with many twists and turns that wound its way through Vista Overlook and this was the road Doctor Eugen would take to exit the neighborhood. On his way out, however, the sight of Doctor Eugen would meet the hideous appearance of a rather out-of-place dwelling on the edge of Vista Overlook. This one house was the only poor exception to the great material prosperity of the other residents of Vista Overlook. The home in consideration was only one story tall and much of it was falling apart. In fact, to a keen observer, the whole plot of land was askew, tilting away from the much nicer homes. Doctor Eugen saw this one bad mark on an otherwise pristine habitation and this filled him with disgust and contempt.\n\nThis was where Norman lived.\n\nAs Doctor Eugen approached the home of Norman in his black Rolls Royce, he saw a lonely man in his dirty bath robes standing before it in the driveway. This man was bald with a wrinkled face, in his early forties, and leaned slightly to his right on account of the arthritis in his left foot. In his right hand he was holding a mug of black coffee and in his left arm he was holding a pretty little white cat. \n\nThis was Norman. Doctor Eugen hated Norman. \n\nNorman and his cat, also called Norman, knew how much Doctor Eugen hated him, yet this did not stop Norman from waving at Doctor Eugen like any good neighbor would do. However, at the sight of this friendly gesture, Doctor Eugen became angry and firmly pressed down on the gas pedal of his black Rolls Royce and its tires lost their grip on the ground and promptly \"burned rubber\". This rather hurt Norman's feelings. He thought: \"Why does he hate me as such? I have always been a good neighbor to him! Since I've been living here, always waving at him or saying 'How do you do?' when he leaves for work. This will not bother me today, oh no. Today is going to be a good day!

Reflecting on Norman's own health, he decided that going to the gym and trying to become more fit himself would be a good thing for his cat, Norman, to see. \"I must try and be the best Norman I can be\", he said to himself proudly. \n\nThe next day, Norman woke up at a reasonable time, ate his oatmeal and berries, and travelled to the gym which was shy of 15 minutes away. Norman sat in the car and looked at his watch. \"2:35 is a perfectly good time to visit the gym\" he said to himself. He strolled across the parking lot and entered the gym. The unfamiliar music was a bit too loud for his taste, but he tried to tune it out as he steadily walked to the front desk. \n\nNorman was second in line, behind a young, fit woman who was renewing her gym membership. \"That will be $450 even please, ma'am\" said the man at the desk. Norman was suddenly beside himself. \"Can I afford $450?\" Norman thought to himself. \n\nThe woman ahead of him flashed a smile at Norman, and left into the depths of the unfamiliar Gymnasium. \"How can I help you today, Sir?\" Said the man. Norman thought, and thought hard as he hadn't done his research about pricing. \"I will take a 6 month membership, please.\" \n\nThe man at the desk looked friendly with bright blue eyes.His eyes shifted to the computer in front of him and he started to type. \"I will need you to fill out this form\" Said the man. \"Please sign here, here, and...here\". He appeared as though he was a regular himself and Norman felt uneasy, maybe even jealous. \"I'm sorry sir,\" Norman added \"I actually meant that I would take the full year membership\". \"Excellent!\" Said the man. \"That will come to $900\". \n\nAt this point, Norman started to sweat. He knew that he couldn't turn down the membership he asked for, or he would look like a fool. \"Thank you\", Norman said as he flashed his Visa.\n\nNorman decided to skip the gym that day, as he figured he would need a few hours to learn about the equipment, and the gym closed at 5. \"There's always tomorrow\" Norman said to himself as he walked to the car, anticipating Norman's me-ow upon his return. \"Today was a good day\".\n\n" }

He tried to see his father in his mind’s eye; a stoic, balding man with weary eyes, edges smoothed down by the weathering of life. He thought about the man who lifted him and spun him around when he was five. He thought about the man who dragged him out to shoot hoops when his eyes were stuck to a computer screen at age thirteen. \n\nNorman Jr. thought about telling his father about this one girl, Cindy, from class. Instead he said, “Oh, I forgot to tell you, Dad. I learned to make spaghetti the other day, and my friend Spencer showed me a work-out regime.”\n\nNorman remembered the first time he held Norman Jr. in his arms. He was so tiny, so fragile, and so dependent. He remembered feeling that suddenly, nothing else mattered in the world, and he gained a suit of armor and an Achilles ’ heel all at once.

Norman spotted a small bag of treats made by the same brand that made Norman's food. He decided on that one, but with tuna flavor.\n\nNorman felt a little giddy inside as he placed the bag in the cart. He was happy to get a little treat for his friend and hoped he liked it.\n\nWhen Norman got home, he unpacked his groceries then opened the bag of treats. He grabbed one from the top of the bag and gave it to Norman. Norman sniffed it for a few seconds, then grabbed it from Norman's fingers and happily ate it." }

How are you? I can't hear you, so I'll do all the talking right now. Today is the last update for The Book of Norman. It's the last update, because hopefully, the next post I do about the book will be telling you how you can read it for yourself! So I guess there's some questions here. Obviously, not all of you are even aware there was a book in the works in the first place- if anything, the amount of messages the moderation team and I receive titled, \"hey! Someone should make a book already!\" and then me having to say, \"I already am!\", and them saying, \"Good luck!\", should be an indicator that no one knows what the hell I've been doing.\n\nWhen I first started this project, the subreddit was a mere 5,000 at the time. I had an overwhelming number of supporters- 36 upvotes- and that was enough to think this project was worth pursuing. At the time, I didn't know how big this book would be, or even how much the subreddit would grow in the span of a year. Nearly a whopping 60,000 at the time that I'm writing this. A lot of that has to do with /r/askreddit threads, and thank God for those occasional blessings. Some people think booms dilute the subreddit, change what it is to fit a broader audience, but I don't think that's ever a bad thing. Maybe there's someone out there who, deep in their heart, know that writing Norman stories is there damn meaning to life. That all their mundane adventures finally have an outlet. Those people would never discover the subreddit unless those booms happened. So for that, and all the generations of new Norman readers and writers, I'm glad. Anyways, enough sappy congratulations before any is due, let's get down to it.\n\n\n\n**What the hell is The Book of Norman about?**\n\nThis is definitely something that has to be addressed before the book is released- it's not a conventional book. It's not a 1,000 page epic about Norman and his romance with Lisa(On that note, Lisa will only have a cameo in the book- I'm sorry for those of you looking forward to her, but, well, she didn't exist by the time I stopped collecting stories.), instead, it's a calendar of sorts. \n\n**The book is a day by day telling of Norman's life, over the span of a year.** Each day is a different story, all stories collected from here, the subreddit, although there are a number written specifically for the book that can't be found online.\n\nThe way that I formatted it was to keep a canon for myself- so even though any story can dress Norman differently here on the subreddit, the book has a much more concrete depiction of Norman. In it, Norman is in his late 40's, his son, Norman Jr is all grown up, but doesn't speak with his father, and Norman drives a Daihatsu. All familiar things, but I'm just making it clear that this Norman is a clearer image. There'll of course be contradictory parts of the book- it's really, really hard to remember all the times that Norman uses his phone, times where he goes grocery shopping, and times where he watches different television programs- but there shouldn't be any glaring inconsistencies, I assure you.\n\nWhat I kept in mind was to balance the emotions that Norman stories usually carry- yes, there will be stories where Norman is goofy and anti-social, there'll be times where he's too afraid of answering the phone, and there'll also be several stories of Norman's romantic failures. There's also times where Norman's depression, is a factor. Those stories hit in bouts, sometimes a full week of Norman feeling blue. I like those times- those are the ones where I want to keep reading on. \n\nA thing I want to stress about the book before it comes out is that it's not a conventional book. You've probably never read a book quite like this before- not in the sense that it's phenomenon of sorts, well maybe it will be, but just in the sense that it's formatted very differently. There isn't a first, second and third act- there isn't a massive overarching story that'll be resolved by the end. It's more about an experience, a lasting memory of Norman's life. So yes, it may be boring to some people. But it is what it is, and Norman's life is what you would expect it would be.\n\n**How you can buy it, and where the money goes**\n\nThe book, for now, will only be available for e-book purchase. Unfortunately, publishing a physical novel is a lot of hard work- and not all my decision. I would have to find a publisher who would accept the book, and strike a deal with them. And if any of you are interested in publishing a book and have done your homework, you would know that the feat is easier said than done. So for now, an e-book is all the book will be, unless it happens to find success and the attention of a publisher, I doubt it will be much more than that.\n\nI'll be sure to get it on as many devices as possible- Amazon Kindle definitely, Kobo e-reader as well, and any other e-reader that you guys can suggest now. The book will be priced at **7 dollars**. It's not a lot, and without page breaks, the book is around 200 pages; 75,000 words. It's not a large price, but the thing that should certainly be kept in mind is that **100% of the profits of the book will be donated to charity.** This is a promise I've made to everyone a long time ago, and something I've been up front with from the beginning. I'll be crediting my name as the publisher/creator of the book, and I'll be collecting the money. That's something I'm working on right now- I'm trying to find a way to make it very transparent for all of you, to show how much the book has made. I've opened up a second account with my bank today, and none of it will get muddled with my own accounts. I'll be sure to put my own ass on the line here- my name will be publicly available, so if I do end up scamming you guys out of your money, I'll be sure to give you plenty of ways to kill me; that's all just for assurance to know that I'm not giving you guys the short end of the stick. \n\n\nEDIT: All this ebook stuff is a lie! In the time since I wrote this, I've been convinced, haggled, and persuaded to make it a physical copy. So, I can't promise it will be 7 dollars anymore. However, if the book does well, I will make the ebook and release it for 7 dollars. \n\n**The Charity**\n\nI've had an idea for quite a long time for where the money should go- I always just said charity, but that's such a vague description. My college fund could be charity. But, I've always felt that the money should go towards something very... Norman. So what's more Norman than cats?\n\nhttp://catscradleanimalrescue.com/\n\nFor now, I've decided on the animal shelter called Cats Cradle, located in Victoria, British Colombia, Canada. The reason I chose it is because:\n\n1. It's in Canada, I'm from Canada, meaning I could go and visit it if I needed to,\n\n2. It's a cat shelter. I feel like, if there's any way to help people with Norman's stories, it's that Norman's silver lining in life is his cat, Norman. I thought it's a nice gesture to help out cats find their own Norman too. \n\n3. Cats Cradle is a shelter that focuses on, from their page:\n\n \"Cat’s Cradle Animal Rescue was founded to rescue, rehabilitate, spay/neuter, and re-home distressed, abandoned, or neglected cats and dogs considered un-adoptable by reason of health, age, appearance, or temperament.\"\n\nI think that the idea of cats that are, based on appearance, unlovable, but still have heart, is what made me choose this charity. Norman looks unlovable, sure, but it's what's inside that counts. Finding these cats homes is the best fit for the subreddit's mantra.\n\n   . 4. They're an independent charity, as well as 100% non-profit as well. I'm sure there's bigger charities to help, but at the same time, don't you want to know your money is making an apparent difference? I'm sure the few thousand we could raise wouldn't bat the eyes of UNICEF, but certainly mean the world to a smaller charity. \n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAnyways everyone, that's it for now. The book should be ready for release sometime in January- although I still have a lot of work to do before then.\n\nI'd just like to say thanks to everyone for their support to me, support to the book, and support for the subreddit. I'll say the sappy cliche thing- this place couldn't be what it is without all of you. This book is a collective effort of hundreds of people, and it's all in the name of something so peculiar- a little man named Norman. But in the end, this fictional character will have an actual, physical impact on the world, aside from just our imaginations. I think Norman would be happy with what he has become; from a grumpy man writing a review on a Mac, to an icon of boredom, loneliness, and the always powerful idea that is positivity and looking on the bright side of life is all that matters.\n\nI look forward to my next update- the release of the book. Hopefully, even if you don't want to read the book, that you can make a donation to the shelter anyways. Every little bit helps. " }

It's great that the subreddit is getting attention once again; things get a bit slow every now and then and this surge definitely breathes a breath of fresh air into the subreddit. Like many would know(default subreddits being an example), a large number of new people leads to a lot of new issues. So I'll try to be quick to talk and hold your attention, and use bullet points and bold to get my points across.\n\n\n*  **Be kind to one another.**\nThis is a peaceful subreddit, and we're here to relate about the lifestyles of Norman, not to bully or put down each-other. If you don't like a story, let them know with some criticism and not with bullying.\n\n* **Norman isn't just about making fun of a small man.** Something that always happens with surges is a change in how stories are written. When there's a flow of thousands of stories, the idea of what a Norman story is changes. It goes from sad, depressing, a hit to the gut in a way that only makes Norman relatable. [For example, this story from a few days from before the surge](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/3p03p8/norman_moves_into_his_new_apartment/), to more stuff [like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/3phv44/norman_says_hello_again/). It's just the trend when you have thousands of new posts, but always remember- in a funny way- Norman is a person. There's a lot of people who relate and care about Norman, so don't make stories with the sole regard to put him down. **Norman is a character- not a caricature.**\n\n* **Keep trying!**- You won't always get the true heart of Norman when you write your first story. Sometimes to takes a few tries, and that's okay. Hell, my first stories (I joined the subreddit when it was a wee lad of 4,000) were downvoted because they were so... *Not Norman*. So don't feel too bad about having your first story unsuccessful. It's all about perseverance and trying again. \n\nAnyways, enjoy everyone! I would say have fun, but we know that not all Norman stories lead to that conclusion. Treat each-other like your mother knows your reddit account name.\n\n\n Thanks guys and gals. \n\n\n" }

The salty flavor came as quite a shock, but Norman dared not spit it out in front of Lisa, for fear of being rude.  Norman chewed away at his mouthful, determined to see it through, and to his great surprise, he rather enjoyed it!  Norman was astonished.

You should be able to read this one on it's own, but it definitely benefits from reading the other story.*\n\nNorman was always closer to his father. He had a very relaxed, friendly personality (not unlike Norman himself) that he found both welcoming and reassuring. Norman didn't dislike his mother by any means, she was a small lady who was often assertive, he just always gravitated to his father. \n\nAs Norman drove up in his used station waggon he bought with his tuition refund, he went over what he needed to say. It had been nearly 6 months since he found out about the pregnancy. He thought perhaps he waited too long to tell his parents and was nervous about their reaction, specifically his mother's. He had wished his girlfriend, now fiancé, joined him but she wasn't feeling to well.\n\nNorman slowly walked down the familiar pathway through the yard. He climbed the steep stairs, and let himself in. His parents were watching the news, and both stood up when Norman entered for a hug. He hugged them both, and told them to sit back down.\n\nNorman began the story about the pregnancy, having to quit school, the decision to get married. His parents always let Norman finish talking before saying anything. They stared at Norman somewhat blankly. Norman finished the story by placing an invitation to his wedding on their coffee table.\n\n\"Norman, we love you no matter what,\" His mother spoke first.\n\nNorman's father sat back a little in his seat, and scratched his beard, as he always did before he said something important.\n\n\"We do love you, Norman, but we can't support this,\" Norman's mother almost looked as shocked as Norman himself, \"I can't support a child out of wedlock and I can't support you giving up school.\"\n\nNorman stared blankly at his father. He never talked back to his parents, not even as a child.\n\n\"Well, Pop, it is extremely important to me to get married before the child is born,\" Norman began as respectful as he could, \"and maybe after the birth I can go back-\"\n\n\"We will not support this child and we will not support you in this.\" Norman's father spoke in a stern tone that Norman had never heard before. This was extremely unlike Norman's father, but like Norman himself, he had a very traditional sense.\n\nNorman looked to his mother for support. Surely she would stand up for him, be his saviour. She looked like she disagreed with Norman's father but never said a word against him. She placed her hands on her husband's hands, and supported his decision.\n\nNorman didn't understand but would have to respect his parents decision. He walked towards the door, and when he exited he heard it lock behind him, something which had never happened in any previous visit. He knew what this meant, and defeated, he returned to his car.\n\nAbout a month later, Norman was sitting comfortably in his favourite chair, sorting through mail. He received a return RSVP to his wedding, and began opening it. Instantly, he recognized it was from his parents. They had checked off the box \"Respectfully Decline\".\n\nIt didn't matter much, as the wedding would have to be postponed, as Norman's fiancé went into labour the morning of the wedding. It was a little bit early, but the baby was delivered successfully. It was a boy.\n\nAs Norman held his son in his arms for the first time, he was overcome with emotion. It was a truly beautiful thing that he helped create. It was someone he would love, cherish, be proud of, and support, all unconditionally.\n\nNorman wondered if his own father felt the same feeling when he was born." }

Norman usually drank one at most, but last night he realized how lonely he was, so tried \"to drink the pain away,\" as they say. Norman knew that he needed a companion.\n\nAs soon as he woke up he used his laptop and searched for the local Humane Society, finding out it opened at 9am.

Not a kitten?\"\n\n\"Yes ma'am,\" Norman replied.\n\n\"How delightful, most people come in here wanting a kitten, and I always feel so bad for the adult cats here.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Norman replied, not quite sure how to answer.\n\n\"Right this way,\" she said, smiling, leading him down a hallway. \"This is our cat room.\"\n\nNorman entered the room, unsure what to do next. The receptionist closed the door behind and left him inside. He walked around the room, careful not to trip over some of the cats nuzzling in-between his legs.\n\n'How ever should I choose one?' Norman thought to himself. \n\nHe sat down in a worn out, and clawed armchair, pondering his decision. As he sat down, it spooked a gray cat which had been napping behind the armchair. It jumped out, licked its paws, then looked directly at Norman. \n\n\"I'm sorry little guy, I didn't mean to spook you,\" Norman said, while reaching out his hand. The gray cat nuzzled against it, purring. Norman scooped it up and knew this was the one. He would name it Ash, to match his or her fur. It was the perfect name, because it really was quite clever. If it was a boy, then it'd be short for Ashton, if a girl, short for Ashley. \n\nNorman walked back to the receptionist, carrying Ash.\n\n\"I would like to purchase this one please.\"\n\n\"Aww, how adorable,\" the receptionist said, \"He's been in here for a while, I'm so glad he'll have a happy home to go to.\"\n\n'Ah, so it's a boy,' Norman thought to himself, while scratching Ash's chin.\n\n\"What's it's name?\" asked the receptionist, filling out the paperwork.\n\nNorman wasn't paying attention, he was too distracted scratching Ash's chin and enjoying his purring. He thought the receptionist asked \"What's *your* name.\"\n\n\"Norman,\" replied Norman, continuing to scratch Ash's chin.\n\n\"Aww, what a perfect name for him,\" the receptionist said.\n\nNorman realized his mistake, but it was too late. The receptionist had already filled out all the paperwork.\n\nNorman and Norman left the Humane Society together, with Norman smiling, and Norman purring.\n\n\n\nEdit: fixed a few grammar mistakes, and changed beer to root beer\n\n" }

Christmas, Norman thought, should be spent with people you care about. \n\nNorman knew it was supposed to be cold that night, so he put on one of his favorite sweaters and drove to Lisa’s.\n\nWhen he got to the party, he was one of the first to arrive. He knocked on the door and Lisa answered. She hugged Norman when he came in. She was warm and smelled good, like the women in shampoo commercials must smell like.\n\nLisa left to go to the kitchen and Norman went to a table with chips and dip. His favorite chips were sour cream and onion, but there were only regular chips and BBQ. Norman grabbed a paper plate to put some chips on, but four plates stuck together and he put them all down. He cupped his hand and help some chips there. He didn’t get to try any dip.\n\nRick appeared behind Norman. “Wow, Norman. That’s the ugliest sweater I’ve ever seen.” Norman immediately felt bad and wanted to leave. \n\nLisa came up to them and said, “No, I know. That’s what I said when I saw him.” \n\n“What do you mean?” Norman asked.\n\n“You win. You brought the ugliest sweater.” Rick said.\n\nNorman looked around and realized everyone at the party was wearing a sweater, some more outrageous than others. Rick was wearing a sweater covered in cats that looked like Norman.\n\n“I like your sweater,” said Norman. \n\nA few other people came up to Norman and complimented his sweater, but what they said didn’t feel like compliments. Norman stood around the chips for some time, until he felt strange and wanted to leave.\n\nAs he drove home, Norman felt the grease from the chips against his hand. He tried to rub his hand on his sweater to wipe it off, but his fingers stayed greasy.\n" }

In his right hand was a receipt, which he was studying intently. When Norman arrived at the car he had checked it three times and could come to no other conclusion than that the checkout girl had forgotten to deduct the discount from his coupon. Earlier that week Norman had clipped it from the local newspaper and, using a cat shaped magnet, put it on the fridge with his grocery list. The coupon was supposed to have given him a 30% discount on chicken breasts.\nAfter having put the groceries in the trunk, Norman sat down in his car indecisively. He thought about going back to the store, but since it lacked a service desk, he would have to bother the checkout girl and all the customers that were waiting in line at the cash register. Norman sighed. He should have been paying more attention when his groceries were being scanned.\n\nHis thoughts drifted to a similar incident that had happened almost a year ago. That day he had rushed home after shopping for groceries at the very same supermarket. He had been home just in time to prepare diner and watch CSI. Foolishly he hadn't checked the receipt until after enjoying his home cooked diner and watching CSI. He had been very unsettled to find out that the broccoli he had just eaten hadn't been payed for. For several nights after that unlucky incident he had been kept awake by guilt of his unintended theft. \n\nSuddenly Norman tensed up a little bit in his car seat. He remembered the price of that broccoli like it was yesterday. When taking into account the 8% interest that he owed the store by now, it totalled to the exact amount of the forgotten discount on chicken breasts. Norman stared at the receipt incredulously. It was almost as if the universe had decided to help him set things straight and they now shared a happy little secret. Neither one would ever tell anyone else about it of course, but on occasion they might wink at each other knowingly.\n\nAfter calming down, Norman put on his seat belt and drove home.

He stopped at Wal-Mart and made his way to the pet supply aisle.\n\nNorman picked up the smallest package of cat nip he could find. He then thought about Lisa and what she might need. He picked up a bone and some treats for her. It was definitely more expensive than he thought it would be, but Norman half hoped that perhaps Lisa would be impressed by his preparedness. \n\nNorman took his purchases to the front counter and paid for everything. He got to his apartment and noticed he forgot to put away the dishes he had washed after dinner last night. Embarrassed, he quickly went to put them away before Lisa showed up.

So he stepped on board.\n\nThe only seat available in the car was next to a young Black college student wearing a black coat and holding a leather messenger bag.

And after thinking long and hard about the possible consequences of his actions, Norman decided to place the chips back on the rack.  \n\n\nWhile paying for his groceries, Norman felt proud of his decision.  Not only had he saved $1.50 with the coupon, but he had also saved an extra $2.00 (and his health) by choosing not buying the potato chips.  Because of this, Norman left the store a happy man.  He had saved lots of money, and now had plenty of food for Norman and himself to enjoy.\n\n\nBut other men were not so fortunate.  Upon exiting the supermarket, someone called out to him.  It was a middle-aged, shaggy-haired man wearing clothes that looked like they hadn't been washed in months.\n\n\n\"Good afternoon sir,\" he said.  \"Spare change for some food?\"\n\n\nNorman looked around anxiously.  Although he did, in fact, have money with him, the homeless man's sudden approach made him feel very tense and uncomfortable.  Without making eye contact, Norman mumbled \"Sorry, I don't have any with me\".  Then quickening his pace, Norman rushed into his car and closed the door.\n\n\nBut as he buckled his seatbelt, an uneasy feeling began to swirl inside Norman.  He didn't like telling such a bold-faced lie.  It wasn't that he didn't want to help the man - he just wasn't comfortable with strangers speaking to him so out of the blue.  He thought about the man, who had been standing out there for hours and probably hadn't eaten in ages.  Norman glanced at his nice bag of groceries. He felt guilty.\n\n\nAt that moment, Norman decided to do something rash.  He unbuckled his seatbelt and stepped out of the car, taking something with him.  The homeless man was still sitting where he had left him - in front of the supermarket doors - when Norman approached.  And, working up his courage, Norman placed one of his cans of tomato soup on the ground next to him.\n\n\nThe homeless man looked up.  Smiling a toothy grin, he thanked Norman for his kindness.  Norman assured him that it was no problem.  Two cans of soup was a lot for just one person, anyway.\n\n\nNorman walked back to his car.  And as he buckled his seatbelt, he felt proud." }

As Norman was paying for his gas and drink, the cashier asked, \"Do you have your Club Chill card?\" Norman had never heard of such a thing, so he shook his head. \"Would you like to join Club Chill? Every tenth drink is free!\" Norman thought it over. It sounded like a good deal, but he had never joined a club before.

He examined it closely as his gas pumped into the tank. It didn't have his name on it, but Norman felt a swelling of pride for being part of an exclusive club.

{ "subreddit" : "lifeofnorman", "title" : "Norman Fills His Gas Tank", "text" : "Norman was driving home from work in his brand new Corolla and decided to stop for fuel. Norman drove by some brand name gas stations and found the gas prices too high. He knew of a small local gas station that always had lower prices than the brand name stations, so he decided he’ll go there.\n\nIt was a little out of the way, but Norman thought it would be worth the money he would save. “Plus,” Norman thought to himself, “there’s that Family Dollar next door and Norman needs more wet food.” \n\nWhen Norman arrived at the station, there was a long line of cars waiting to fill up their tanks. He joined the rest of them and waited patiently, listening to the traffic updates on the radio station and feeling a little tingle down his spine when the announcer mentioned the highway Norman gets off of to go home. The thought of being part of the traffic, being included in the report, although anonymously, made him feel involved and noticed. \n\nThis feeling of importance was heightened when another car pulled up behind him and was also waiting patiently for Norman to fill his tank first. Norman knew that the people in the car behind him were depending on him. It was almost Normans turn, and the closer he got to the pump, he more he felt like he was being noticed. This thought brought him joy. \n\nWhen it’s finally Norman’s turn, he turns off his engine, and digs in his back pocket for his wallet. He takes out his debit card, walks out of the car and reads the white hand-written sign that says ‘Cash Only’. Norman puts his card back in its slot and opens up the bills compartment. Norman has a $20 bill and two $1 bills. He decides he’ll do $20 and save the $2 for Norman. \n\nHe walks up to the small window where the middle aged man is sitting and says, “Hello, I’d like to add $20 worth of fuel to my vehicle please. It’s the silver Toyota Corolla over there” Norman points at his vehicle. Norman hands him the money. “Number 3?” Asks the attendant with a heavy middle-eastern accent. Norman looks back at the gas pump to verify that he indeed parked his car in front of pump number 3. Norman turns to face the attendant and with a nervous chuckles blurts out a confirmation.\n\nThe attendant quickly looks away from Norman, punches his fingers into his register and says “OK,” With a dismissive tone. Norman asks for a receipt and the attendant replies, “No receipt.”\n\nWith a little glimmer of disappointment Norman walks back towards his car, opens the fuel door, picks up the fuel nozzle, inserts it in the side of his car and hits ‘87’. \nAs Norman stands there he begins to think about Norman. He missed Norman and he was excited to bring him home some of his favorite food. Norman only feeds Norman wet food once or twice a week. He really enjoyed seeing Norman so happy and loving. Norman would rub himself against Norman’s legs as he prepared his food. \n\nNorman’s thoughts were interrupted when the nozzle stopped fueling. He looked back at the digital display on the pump and it read ‘$18.94’ under Purchase and ’7.72’ under Gallons. Norman remembered that his car has a 13 gallon gas tank and concluded that it was full. He released the nozzle and put it back in its holster. \n\nInstantly, Norman felt a little nervous about going back up to the attendant to ask for his remaining change. Norman felt like it was his fault; that he should have better calculated how much fuel his car needed and how much it was going to cost him. Norman felt guilty for having to go bother the attendant, and for having to make the people behind him wait even longer than they had to. \n\nNorman wanted his change back though, because he thought of it as an extra two cans of wet food for Norman. He gathered his courage and went to ask for his change. The attendant didn’t seem to care and gave Norman $1.06. \n\nNorman smiled tightly as he walked back to his car and drove it to the Family Dollar parking lot. “Norman is going to be so excited!” Norman thought to himself. \n" }

He would decide when he got home.\n\nAs he was gathering his things to leave, Norman decided to use the restroom before he left.\n\n“That way, I won’t be uncomfortable if there’s traffic on the way home.” Norman smirked at his cleverness.\n\nOn his way to the restroom, Norman noticed Lisa’s cubicle was already empty. Norman glanced at his watch – 5:01. Lisa must’ve gotten out in a hurry, Norman thought. As he approached the restroom, he glanced out the window overlooking the parking lot. The sun had just set, but Norman could still make out Lisa’s familiar figure moving across the lot, walking briskly. Norman felt awkward, watching her from afar, but as he turned to proceed to the bathroom he noticed Lisa jump into the arms of a man he hadn’t noticed, waiting by her car. They held the embrace for a moment, exchanged a few words, and climbed into Lisa’s car. Norman realized he’d been frozen during the whole exchange, and for some reason he felt a knot in his stomach. He frowned, puzzled, and continued to the restroom.\n\nWhen Norman arrived home, he put his things down on the counter and slinked off into the living room. Dinner wasn’t on his mind anymore. He turned on the television and decided to watch CSI until his appetite returned. For some reason, the puzzled feeling followed him home from the office that day. Norman climbed onto Norman’s lap and laid down for a nap. For some reason, it didn’t fill Norman with the sense of satisfaction it usually did. Before he knew it, Norman had watched four episodes of CSI, and it was nearly 9:30. He noticed he could hardly recall which episodes he had watched – his mind was cloudy with distractions he couldn’t quite put his finger on. He decided that it was too late for dinner, and he retired for bed early.\n\nWhen Norman arrived at work early the next day, he was surprised to see that Lisa was the only one already at the office. He avoided her for a bit, but on a trip to the water cooler she approached him and asked how his evening was.\n\n“Oh, fine,” Norman answered. “Nothing special.” He paused a moment before asking Lisa how her evening was. He wasn’t truly very interested, for some reason.\n\n“Oh, it was great!” Lisa was beaming. “My father was in town for the day and took me out for a surprise dinner! It was fantastic!”\n\n“That’s great!” Norman replied, as Lisa excused herself back to her work. Norman felt a wave of relief wash over him, but he wasn’t sure why.

{ "subreddit" : "lifeofnorman", "title" : "Book of Norman Update #9- What's Next", "text" : "So I think it's been about 5 months since my last official update, which is a good deal of time. The plus side is that those were not an idle 5 months. I'm sorry to have to say that the book will not continue on.\n\nThings are really tough- my plate is full of school, other projects, things that come and go and the book is... Pushing it. Over the last few months, I've realized that this isn't worth the time it's taking. Sometimes you just have to cut your losses and move on. It's been fun, reading hundreds of Norman stories, moderating, and meeting new people, but I'm afraid this is going to be the end. \n\nEh. Just screwing with you all. Seriously, after a bloody *year* of collecting stories and surrounding my life with a 40 year old lonely man and a cat, I can't give up now. We're so close!\n\nVery close in fact. Just yesterday, I finished editing the first draft of all the stories. Really, all that entitled was cleaning up grammar here and there, separating page long paragraphs into digestible chunks, and doing some continuity work. There's no need for Norman's boss to have 17 names.\n\nAlso, on the side, I've been organizing the stories throughout a calendar year. I decided the year the book will take place is 2011, simply because it's close enough to work with all the modern references, while also having things like a landline not be totally obscure. What I've done is copy every story, the title, the author, a synopsis of the story, little notes (like if the story mentions his cat, or if it takes place in a certain season), as well as a little rating out of ten. Then, I made a massive calendar out of black bristleboard, covered my walls in the stuff, and stuck the notes onto the slots. It makes it look like I'm a serial killer.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/8cfXrQR.jpg\n\nSo, now that the editing is done, the only thing standing in between me and a first draft of the book is fixing the calendar. That shouldn't take more than a week, depending on how fast I move about it. I'm about 75% through it. \n\nSo naturally the next thing to happen would be to get some beta readers going on it. Luckily, I feel like there's a few of you that will be willing to give the book a shot. I have something in mind, where each reader will be given a different task to make notes of different things in the book. For example, I forgot to mark off which stories Norman goes grocery shopping, or which stories mention him having a cellphone. So instead of reading the entire thing over again, I'll kill a few birds and get everyone to notice different mistakes.\n\nSo how do you become a beta-reader? Simple enough. Ask to be a beta reader in the comments. Just let me know you're interested. \n\nBut it's not that simple. Once you comment, I'm not going to accept you- not just yet. Five days from now, after you've commented and said that you're interested, send me a PM that you're *still* interested. Then I'll let you come along.\n\nWhy the dance? Well, mostly because from what I've learned over the years is that people are always willing to lend a hand, but very rarely actually want to do anything about it. I'm just figuring that if you can't remember, or don't care to, talk to me about the project again a mere five days from now, chances are you wouldn't have sat down and read an entire novel for me.\n\nSo anyways, that's the deal; that's where things stand. I'm aiming to have everything done by January 2016, hopefully getting the book released for New Years, which will fit well with the books year format. Also, /u/Jolly_Line_Rhymer has been working on getting a cover for the book. What's he's shown me so far is fantastic, but we'll wait for a more finalized version before I show all of you guys. \n\nStay tuned." }

It was normal for Norman's son to bring movies for them to watch throughout the afternoon or night. Sometimes Norman wished he could have a good chat with his son, but his son always insisted on watching something. Norman put this down to his son being part of a different generation. \n\nNorman didn't mind what they watched, so his son started playing the first episode of the 2015 HBO documentary miniseries *The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst* as something to put on. Norman's son said he'd watched it before and that his father might like it. Norman never liked the shows that his son showed him but always said he liked them, not wanting to admit some of the stuff his son liked seemed weird or artsy or depressing to Norman. \n\nThat night Norman and his son broke their unspoken rule about not spending more than four hours in each other's company by binge-watching every episode of The Jinx. Norman was utterly engrossed, to an extent that even astounded his son. Over the course of the series, Norman engaged with his son by offering unsolicited opinions after certain revelations. When a Galveston, Texas jury was revealed to have found the subject of the documentary, Robert Durst, not guilty of the murder of Morris Black, Norman muttered, \"Unbelievable.\" When Durst revealed he had lied on the night of his wife's disappearance, Norman clucked his tongue and shook his head. When Susan Berman's murder was explored half-way through the series, Norman commented, \"You know he did it. We all know he did it,\" and at the end of episode 5 Norman exclaimed, \"Holy moley\" when a discovered envelope revealed that Durst shared Berman's killer's handwriting style and, as in a note sent to the police by Berman's killer, Durst had misspelled the word \"Beverly\". \n\nNorman watched the final episode in a tense forward body position, leaning his elbows on his knees, poised on the edge of the couch for the entire episode. At the end, Norman clapped a hand to his head and audibly gasped when Durst appeared to confess to three murders while alone in the bathroom. As the screen faded to black, Norman spouted: \"Got ya! You... you... *fuck*\", causing his son to smile for some reason. \n\nThe next morning at work, Norman could not get The Jinx or Robert Durst out of his head. Loading up Yahoo! rather than starting on his first project for the day, Norman immediately searched for the term \"Robert Durst\". Various links revealed that Durst was awaiting trial in declining health. Norman also learned that the family of Durst's missing first wife watched the final episode live when it initially aired on television alongside the producers of the program, and that the family cried with happiness as they felt they had some partial closure. \n\nNorman was startled when Chris from I.T. appeared beside him, speaking in a bored tone about updating the system. Norman realized an hour of work had already passed but unusually, this did not bother him. Norman asked Chris, \"Did you see this?\" pointing at the screen. Chris immediately perked up and both men had an animated conversation for five minutes, with Chris inviting Norman to join him and the other I.T. guys for lunch. During lunch in the break room, Norman and his coworkers feverishly discussed Durst's physical appearance including his nervous tic and trademark dark eyes, Durst's probable mental state, the word \"cadaver\", Los Angeles law on killing a witness to a crime, the death penalty, the nature of evil, and the seeming naivete of a man called Andrew Jarecki. \n\nWhen lunch ended, Norman agreed he would download the podcast for something called \"Serial\" and decided he would break his rule of calling his son no sooner than two weeks after a visit by phoning him that very night. He would ask his son what a podcast was and if he had heard of this \"Serial\".  " }

He had never drank port before, but, feeling adventurous, Norman decided that on this night he would give it a try. \n\nNorman pulled a wine glass out from his cupboard. He placed it on his counter top.\n\n\"Here goes,\" Norman said as Norman's eyes followed Norman's hands. \n\nNorman unwrapped the top of the bottle. \"Is this a twist top or the kind you open with a bottle opener?\" Norman asked himself worriedly. Norman didn't own a bottle opener; he had never seen a need for one. He had almost considered buying one, once, when Lisa had invited him to a gift shop to look for gifts for her cousin's wedding. He had eyed it for a good long time - it was silver and had a flared base which appealed to Norman's sensibilities. A practical implement for a practical man. But he rarely drank alcohol, instead preferring water - or warm milk before bed. This port thing was a radical departure from the norm for him. \n\nThe bottle was corked. Norman breathed a sigh of relief. There was no need for such adventures tonight. He was about to sit down for CSI when...\n\nNorman noticed, with very mild anxiety, that underneath the cork were two words: \n\nTWIST. HERE.\n\nNorman had had no idea that a bottle with a cork could also be twisted open. What now? If he twisted the bottle open would the cork fly off? Would port spill all over his linoleum?\n\nNorman remembered that his fortune cookie from when he had ordered in Chinese on Tuesday night had said that Norman needed to expand his horizons. So Norman wandered outside, on to the grass.\n\n\"Here I am a grown man standing out on his back lawn, opening up a bottle of port!\" Norman said. Norman let out a meow as Norman twisted the cork. Once. Twice. Three times. Norman was half expecting it to fly out over the fence. \n\nBut the cork came out easily with no hassle. It didn't pop out at all. No liquid spilled anywhere, although a slightly sweet aroma reached Norman's nose. \n\nNorman walked back to his much brighter kitchen. Now, the bottle said \"Fortified Wine\", so it only made sense that it would be drank much the same as wine. Norman poured one third of a glass.\n\n\"There's no turning back now,\" said Norman. \"Tomorrow, I will wake up a man who has tasted port.\"\n\nNorman took a sip. The drink was actually quite tasty! A little on the sweet side, yet inoffensive. Norman would have a new treat - port - to go with his familiar treat - CSI.\n\nSeveral sips later, however, Norman realized that he had made a mistake. The drink, after a few sips, was too sweet! His mouth now felt cloying.\n\n\"This is what I get for trying something new,\" Norman said sourly. He poured the remainder of the port into the sink. \n\nThe next day at work, Norman was feeling grumpy and told everyone who would listen about his plight from the night before. Most of his colleagues were too busy to help him, and needed to get back to work before he had even finished the part of his story about not being able to figure out which direction to twist the cork in.  Luckily Albert from IT had some valuable advice:\n\n\"Norman, port is a sipping drink,\" Albert explained patiently. \"You don't just pour yourself a full glass and drink it like wine! The reason you only enjoyed the first sip is because you are supposed to only have a little. Try just putting a mouthful's worth at the bottom of your glass tonight instead.\"\n\nWith a spring in his step, Norman got back to preparing fringe benefit tax returns. \n\nIt wasn't until that afternoon that Norman stretched, got up and wandered over to the water cooler. He drew out a plastic cup, held it under the tap and pressed the switch for room temperature water. He filled it almost all the way to the top. \n\n\"I'm certainly not ever drinking port in this quantity!\" Norman chuckled quietly to himself as he brought the plastic cup to his lips. " }

He always set his alarm 9 minutes before he wanted to get up, so he could press snooze once before getting out of bed. But Norman had been up for nearly an hour already, 'who would need an alarm on Mother's day?' Norman thought.\n\nNorman returned to his dining room table and the bouquet he was working on. He 'fluffed' up a daisy in the middle. \"Needs something else.\" Norman whispered as he hurriedly rushed back to the 2 foot planter on his small apartment balcony. He had already picked most of it clean, but there was still a yellow rose. Norman snatched it up and added it to the bouquet. Remarking how the yellow went great with the multi-coloured daisies.\n\nNorman grabbed the telephone and dialed his younger brother, Thomas. The other end answered with a sigh. \"...Hi Norm.\"\n\n\"Uh, hey Tom. I was going to go see mom for breakfast. I thought it might be nice if..\"\n\nThomas cut him off with a snap. \"Cynthia's a mom too Norman! I'm taking her and the kids on the boat today. I'll give mom a call tomorrow, today I'm busy.\"\n\n\"Uh, o-okay.\" Norman sounded sheepish.\n\n\"Gotta go.\" Thomas hung up.\n\nNorman put the phone down and shook his head. He looked at his bouquet and smiled. It was worth the time to plant the flowers, he thought. After spending another 15 minutes arranging the flowers, and then rearranging them back to their original locations, Norman grabbed the bouquet, and a card he had prepared, and headed out the door.\n\nNorman took his Corolla, normally he preferred transit, but he didn't want to hurt the flowers by carrying them for so long. He arrived at his mothers house at 8:10.\n\nNorman's mother answered the door. \"Norman! Oh my goodness it's so nice to see you!\" Norman's mom was always so upbeat; he really liked to visit her. Norman began to greet her, but his mother continued.\n\n\"Are Thomas and Cynthia coming? I would so love to see them.\"\n\nNorman face went blank. \"Oh. Um, Thomas couldn't make it... you know his work...\" \n\n\"Oh. Oh dear.\" Norman's mother tried to hide her disappointment.\n\"Well at least..\" There was an audible pause as her thoughts fumbled.\n\nNorman interrupted the silence, \"Oh! But he gave me these to give to you though!\" Norman handed over his bouquet.\n\nHis mother looked at it with wide eyes. \"Oh, it's so beautiful! I wish he could come with them and see his mother in person though.\"\n\nNorman nodded and gave a half-hearted smile. After entering the house, Norman volunteered to cook his mother breakfast. It was a nice meal, and they chatted for a bit. Norman couldn't help but notice the entire meal  his mother made consistent glances towards his bouquet, which she had put into a vase and on the windowsill, which made Norman proud, even if she thought they came from Thomas. After breakfast Norman hugged her goodbye and went about his day.\n\nOn the way home Norman made one stop, his flower garden would need more seeds for the summer season." }

He spends another five minutes or so looking for a bag full of oranges that all seem ripe, but not too ripe so that they'll last a while in his refrigerator at home.  He selects a bag which is a pretty red color that he didn't remember seeing before.  \"Perhaps it is a new brand,\" he thinks to himself while standing in the checkout line.  It is only just before he reaches the register however, that he realizes that what he holds in his hand is a bag of blood oranges.  Norman has never heard of a blood orange before and doesn't exactly wish to try them now, but as the cashier's voice snaps him out of his thoughts, he realizes that it is far too late to put them back.  They cost 22 cents more than regular oranges.\n\nThe next day, being almost late for work after his alarm failed to go off (though he was thankfully woken by Norman jumping up on his bed in order to lead him to his empty food bowl) Norman hurriedly grabbed an orange from the bag, not remembering that it was a different kind of orange until precisely 10:30 am when he began to peel it.  \"I suppose this is why they call it a blood orange,\" Norman muses slightly aloud as he notes the ruby red color of the fruit, remembering yesterday's escapade at the grocery store as he does.  Figuring he may as well at least eat this one so as not to waste the whole bag, Norman finds himself pleasantly surprised at the tart, yet mild flavor which is more robust than a normal orange.  Norman even goes so far as to imagine himself having a lengthy conversation about blood oranges with Lisa, who in his thoughts is quite impressed with how discerning he is in his citrus tastes.  He did not see Lisa that day, but figures that a conversation of that nature may happen since she seemed interested in Mandarins earlier.  \n\nA week later, Norman never did manage to talk about blood oranges with Lisa, but has grown quite fond of them and resolves to buy another bag, theorizing a possible yearly routine of buying Mandarins when they are in season and blood oranges when they aren't.  As he nears the fruit section his thoughts return to reality as he searches for the blood oranges.  After nearly twenty minutes of searching the whole fruit section of the store multiple times, he finds none of the distinctive pretty red bags.  After an additional ten minutes spent waiting for a nearby store employee to finish restocking grapefruits Norman learns, to his slight dismay, that blood oranges are now also out of season.  With a bag of ordinary navel oranges in his hand, Norman slowly walks to the cashier, thinking about how orange farmers in Italy must also enjoy their vacations. " }

In fact, Norman didn't even know what Geocaching was.\n\n\"Uhm... I'm sorry I don't know what Geocaching is.\" responded Norman. He wasn't sure if it was common knowledge or not, so he felt cautious about responding too cluelessly.\n\n\"Ah, fair enough. It's fun. I think you'll enjoy it.\" said Ralph, before going on to explain what Geocaching was to Norman. Norman didn't really understand fully, something about hidden boxes and GPS, but Norman had seen an extra exciting episode of CSI last night. Why not give it a go, thought Norman.\n\n\"Alright. I'll join you.\" confirmed Norman aloud.\n\n\"Great!\" beamed Ralph. \"I'll catcha at the park tomorrow!\" he finished as clicked his fingers and gave Norman a thumbs up as he walked away.\n\nSaturday morning at 10am, Norman left his house and walked to the park. In the car park he saw Ralph, leaning against his car with a phone in his hand.\n\n\"Norman!\" said Ralph as he looked up, standing up and meeting Norman halfway.\n\n\"Morning Ralph.\" Norman smiled continuing to walk towards Ralph.\n\nNorman and Ralph walked around the park for a while, and while Ralph had some sense of direction, Norman still wasn’t entirely sure what was going on. As the two walked further and further into the park, Norman noticed less and less people around. Suddenly, Ralph stopped walking and took a sharp turn, and was now looking at a tree. Norman took a step back and decided to let Ralph do his thing, he didn’t want to interfere. Ralph turned his head around the trunk of the tree and snapped back to visit Norman. \n\n“Go on Norm, have a look behind the tree.” smiled Ralph. \n\nNorman was hesitant but felt assured nothing bad would happen. He looked behind the tree and saw a small plastic box, painted black, and lightly covered with dead leaves. He picked it up and showed Ralph. Before Norman could say anything, Ralph congratulated him. \n\n“Hey hey! Found your first Geocache!” Ralph beamed again. Norman was still slightly confused, however was quite happy to oblige Ralph by opening the box. \n\nInside, there was a small note pad and a few trinkets. A dice, a playing card, and a plastic fish.\n\n“If you open that notepad up,” explained Ralph “you’ll see the names of all the other people who have been here before us.” \n\nNorman did just that and saw pages and pages of people’s names and dates, signing that they had in fact been in the very place that Norman now stood. Norman felt a sense of wonder, excitement, he felt part of a secret society that no one knew about. Why, before just now, Norman had walked past this place many many times and had never even knew about this being here. Norman paused and took a moment to think about it all. \n\n“This is actually pretty fun.” \n\nRalph explained that if Norman wanted to, he’d swap in one of his trinkets, a little plastic cow, for the fish for Norman to keep. Norman was touched by this gesture and was eager to accept. \n\nNorman and Ralph found 2 more Geocaches in the park that day. One by the river stream, and one very very small one under a park bench which was attached with a magnet. After the day out, Norman and Ralph said goodbye. Norman was satisfied to be back at home, but he was still very satisfied he took a chance and went out. \n\nOnce he sat down in his chair, Norman pounced onto Norman’s lap. \n\n“Hello Norman,” said Norman as he pulled the plastic fish out of his pocket. “You’ll never guess what I did today...”\n" }

A small line of people filed out with Norman not far behind. He had ridden the bus to the local public library so he could return the two books he had just finished: “The History of Bird Watching” for himself, and an omnibus collection of Garfield comic strips, which he would read to Norman, his cat. \n\n\n\nNorman always sought to get his books back early. The thought of an overdue library book filled him with dread. Norman had never returned a book late, nor did he want to deprive a fellow citizen of a literary experience. \n\n\n\nAs he walked up to the library, Norman pondered what he should check out next.  He should probably pick up a form to renew his library card; after all, it was set to expire in another 6 months. Norman looked down at his books - he was pleased with his most recent selections and was grateful to live only a few bus stops from the nearest library. Norman was a lucky guy.\n\n\n\nOnce at the door, Norman noticed a long line of people waiting in the lobby. Not one to skip, he positioned himself in the back of the group and decided to pass the time in line by reading more about everyone’s favorite lasagna-loving fat cat. He moved slowly along with the line, his nose buried in the strips of the book.  \n\n\n\n“That cat REALLY likes lasagna.” Norman commented to himself. “I wonder if Norman would like it.  He’d probably become terribly sick -  best to stick to cat food.”\n\n\n\nAfter a few pages, Norman noticed the line in front of him had dispersed.

Norman realized that he was not in line for book returns. Norman had been in line to go on a date.\n\n\n\nEveryone had taken a seat at the tables around the library and Norman found himself in front of an empty chair. Across the table, a woman with a wide grin on her face looked at him expectantly, waiting for him to sit down. Norman looked towards the exit and then back at the woman seated in front of him.\n\n\n\n“Well?” The woman said “Why don’t you take a seat before someone snaps me up?” she giggled and winked.\n\n\n\nNorman was at a loss for words. “I… uhhh-I... buhh…” A bead of sweat rolled down his back and the blood rushed to his face.\n\n\n\nThe woman’s smile faded and her expression became a mix of confused and concerned as Norman sputtered. “Are you alright?” she asked.\n\n\n\n“Garfield.” He managed.\n\n\n\nThe woman paused, not sure what to do with the information she had just been given, but decided to put on her best smile and extended her hand. “Hi Garfield. I’m Debra. It’s a pleasure to meet you.”\n\n\n\nThis had not improved Norman’s situation. \n\n\n\n“N-n-no, I-I mean the cat.” He stammered.\n\n\n\n“...Cat?” Debra’s hand hung limply in the air.\n\n\n\nNorman’s desire to explain was outweighed by his urgent need to escape. He forced a hurried apology - “Sorry, need to go, goodbye”.\n\n\n\nNorman turned, dropped his books down the return chute (there hadn’t been a line after all), and retreated out the door of the library. The next bus wasn’t scheduled to arrive for another 20 minutes, so he began walking home, eager to leave the speed daters behind.\n\n\n\nBack in the library, Lisa frowned as her first speed date began. She had seen Norman show up for the event, but was saddened to see him leave right when it began. She had hoped for the chance to get to know Norman a little better.

He got in line and looked at the menu to check his options, even though he’d probably stick with his favorite – a plain bagel with a little cream cheese. The line was moving much slower than Norman had expected. It was now 6:15, and Norman wondered if he should just forget about the bagel and wait to eat until after his flight. Unfortunately, Norman noticed that there were now a few people behind him. It would look pretty strange to give up now and excuse himself from the line. As the minutes passed, Norman became more and more anxious. He finally got his bagel (plain with cream cheese, indeed) and rushed back to his gate. As he arrived Norman checked the time – 6:25. He had made it after all and the plane wasn’t even boarding yet.\n\nNorman found a spot where he could eat alone and in peace, and even had time to finish his entire bagel before his section of the plane was called for boarding. He thought back on his actions and realized how silly he’d been to worry so much about being late. Even so, it might be a better idea to just wake up early and make oatmeal next time, Norman thought to himself. \n" }

It was the same station waggon he had purchased now nearly 18 years ago. He tried to sleep, but just couldn't find a comfortable position. It was still early in the night, and he was parked on a quiet street a few blocks from his own house.\n\nIt was a warm night, in the middle of the summer. Norman had a suspicion that what he was doing wasn't quite legal, but he couldn't return home. The thought about what had happened there, the broken vows, made Norman feel sick to his stomach. He could not return there.\n\nSomeone was out walking their dog. As they walked by Norman's car, the peered in and smiled, startling Norman. He decided he had better move somewhere else for the evening.\n\nNorman had no idea where to go. He went through a list of people he knew, in his head. Coworker's, acquaintances... He drew a blank.\n\nNorman had received a letter from his mother a few years ago. In it, his mother wrote about his father being ill. Norman remembered every detail of that letter, his father's cancer diagnosis, what had been going on in their lives, even the return address, which was not his childhood home. \n\nNorman still never went to visit his parents because he wasn't sure if his father wanted to see him. He knew that cancer was a fairly bleak diagnosis, and knew his father had likely already passed, but still never went. Tonight, that would change.\n\nNorman drove up to an old, rundown apartment block. He was shocked that this is where his parents lived. He slowly walked up the door, and used the directory to find his mother's name. His father's name was listed next to it, but was extremely faded.\n\nHe buzzed the number, 309. The voice cracked through the speaker.\n\n\"Hello?\"\n\nNorman recognized the voice as his mother's. After all these years, it hadn't changed a bit.\n\n\"Mom, it's Norman.\"\n\nThe voice on the other end fell silent. You could hear the feedback coming through, a sure sign she was still on the line, but clearly she was speechless. The door buzzed, and Norman entered the building. \n\nHe walked up the steep stairs to the third floor, which were earily reminiscent of his parent's old house. He remembered the last time he walked up those stairs and how much his life had changed since them. He wondered what effect this visit would have on his life.\n\nHe approached his parent's suite, and before he had the chance to knock, his mother opened the door. They stared at eachother briefly.\n\nShe was still small, her silver hair was pushed into a bun. Her face was wrinkled, definitely a lot older than Norman remembered. Her striking blue eyes which Norman always thought gave a cold gaze, looked tired and helpless. Without speaking, she grabbed Norman and gave him a squeezing hug. All the pain he had felt that day, all the worry he had about the future was almost immediately alleviated. He was home, in his mother's arms.\n\nAs his mother welcomed him into her home, he noticed it was nearly top to bottom with pictures. Pictures of Norman's parents, grandparents and even of Norman himself. He smiled as he walked through the small space.\n\nNorman sat on the couch. The suite was surprisingly big, for a one bedroom apartment. Norman's mother was shuffling through some papers on a desk. She pulled out an envelope and handed it to Norman.\n\n\"He wanted you to have this,\" Norman clutched the envelope tightly. He saw his name scribed across it and recognized the handwriting; it was his father's. Suddenly, Norman's worst fears seemed almost confirmed. He knew it was the cancer was serious but had always wished his father has pulled through. This letter confirmed that he didn't.\n\nTears welled in Norman's eyes as he read the letter. Norman's father asked for his forgiveness, apologized for his actions, but it was the final words that really struck Norman.\n\n\"Norman, what I said was completely out of line. I want you to know that no matter what happens in your life I'm proud of you. As I lay here dying, surrounded by only your mother, I don't want you to make the same mistakes I did. Don't push people away, pull them in. And remember, I always love you.\"\n\nAs Norman wiped the tears from his eyes he looked at his mother, who was standing above him. She also had tears welling up, but she smiled. Norman knew how grateful she must have been to see him, and he felt the same way.\n\n\"Do you want to eat something, Normy?\n\nNorman stayed with his mother for a couple years after that, until she, too, grew ill and passed away. Norman never cried much when his mother passed because he knew his father would take care of her. Norman still missed her quite a lot, and decided he'd have to move out.\n\nNorman Jr. helped Norman move. Junior had never spent time at his grandmother's house, he had seen her before, but had never been inside.\n\n\"Dad, you should just stay here. Maybe redecorate or something, but this place is so big compared to your new place.\"\n\nNorman smiled, patted Junior on the head and handed him a box. As Junior left, Norman gazed across the room one last time. The pictures his mother put up still hung on the wall. Norman turned off the lights and left.\n\nAs he entered the hallway, he was stopped by the building manager.\n\n\"You're supposed to give one month of notice before you move out.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm not living here anymore but I'll continue to rent the space.\"\n\nNorman hadn't been able to visit his parents for nearly 20 years.

He just thought one might look nice in his home.\n\nNorman headed to the local farm market that he always liked the idea of, but dare not enter. He stood glaring into the market window far too long as a mother and daughter exited with their fresh bounty. The child stumbled gleefully over the threshold as her attention was focused on the pink balloon that had made her day. The shape of the balloon reminded Norman of the avocado he had come all this way for and he entered.\n\nNorman slowly approached a pile of what looked like dark bumpy pears feeling unsure of himself. A sudden realization dawned upon him that he had never selected one before and immediately regretted not buying a book he would not have read on the subject. He took a deep breath. Moments later he was at the checkout with the avocado of his choosing. It sat tucked in the back corner of the crate and it's dimples reminded him of a cartoon character he couldn't quite remember, but made him smile. He reluctantly placed it on the counter as the cashier inquired \"Is that all?\". This question made Norman feel that his choice was inadequate so he returned it to the pile and walked home.\n" }

A tax free bicycle is just what is needed, he thought. The prospect of getting fit during the work day was tantalising. Perhaps he would end up looking like Mark from accounting!\n\nNorman fought with the printer and eventually extracted the forms he needed to take to the bike shop. He felt full of energy as, after driving home, he walked straight there and began sizing up bicycles. The shop assistant looked Norman up and down, then told him he looked like a Medium/Large bike would fit, so Norman took a Medium/Large bike for a spin. He loved it immediately. No bike had ever felt so comfortable. Returning it to the bike shop, he filled out the forms and returned home.\n\nThat night, still full of excitement, Norman looked at pictures of his bike on the internet. After browsing contentedly, he came across a size chart for his particular bike. He matched his height against the chart, but was surprised to find that for his height, he should be perfect on a Medium bicycle. \n     \nNorman thought about this. Surely the bicycle shop assistant would have known the right size for him. But the bicycle shop assistant didn’t measure him. The bicycle was very comfortable after all. But would it give him a backache after a while? Norman began reading websites, checking whether a slightly-too-large bicycle frame was a problem. Maybe he could go back and try a Medium. But he’d already ordered the bicycle, what would they say if we wanted to change the size? He had been so happy with it in the shop, would the shop assistant laugh at his second thoughts?\n\nIn the morning Norman telephoned the shop and cancelled his order for the bicycle.

He and Norman would have breakfast at 7:00 as always.\n\nFrom the bookshelf he pulled his leather-bound business card organizer. The last card he had put in his wallet was from AAA, so he knew the organizer would have to be completely cleaned out and resorted.

There were a few receipts that would need to be filed after the business cards were sorted. He set them aside, noting that he would keep the receipt for Norman's catnip and return it to the store. Since Lisa, from work, had given him catnip as one of his gifts, the package he had bought wouldn't be fresh by the time it was needed. For once he would be glad to return something to the store. He smiled at the memory of receiving the gifts from her, how he had made eye contact with her, and even looked at her lips before looking away.

He carefully selected two slices from the loaf of bread that had been sitting untouched for a week or so, placed them in the toaster, and depressed the lever.

The movie had a famous actor whose name Norman couldn’t remember and it was about a detective tracking down a serial killer. Norman thought it looked very good.\n\nIntent on seeing the movie, Norman drove to the movie theatre. He parked in one of the farthest spots in the lot and made his way to the ticket counter. When he got there, Norman looked at the board of showtimes, but he couldn’t find his movie listed so he approached a teenager selling tickets.\n\n“Excuse me,” Norman said. “I couldn’t seem to find a movie listed on your showtimes. I believe it’s about a police detective who has to hunt down—“\n\n“Sorry, we’re not playing that.”\n\nNot to be disappointed, Norman looked again to the giant screen of showtimes. He saw that two movies were starting in the next twenty minutes. One was an animated family movie about a sock who is left in a laundromat and has to find his way back home. The other movie was a love story about two co-workers who try and manage their affair and shared workspace. Norman chose to watch the animated movie.\n\nAfter buying a ticket, Norman went to the concession counter. He bought a large soda with no ice and a large, buttered popcorn. Norman was very excited for the popcorn as that was his favorite part of going to the movies. He saw it as an extra treat. Plus, movie theatres make most of their money from concessions, Norman reminded himself. \n\nNorman found his theatre and sat down. As the lights dimmed and the first movie trailer began to play, Norman began munching on some popcorn. With his first bite, Norman realized the concession worker forgot to put butter on the popcorn. That’s okay, Norman thought. Maybe next time. \n\nNear the end of the movie, Norman had finished most of his popcorn and all of his soda. On screen, an old argyle sweater used a piece of himself to patch a hole in the lost sock. The entire situation made Norman feel bad. \n\nJust before the sock made it home, Norman decided he wanted to leave. When he got home, he found Norman lounging on the couch. Norman went to his bedroom and opened his dresser. He returned to the living room and dropped a sock on the floor for Norman to play with. \n" }

Norman, mid-yawn, felt a tap on his shoulder.\n\n\"Scuse me,\" started a small man with large hair, \"you don't happen to be Norman, by chance?\"\n\nNorman didn't know this man, but he knew exactly why he would recognize him. Fifteen years ago, Norman became a legend. A lottery ticket bought on a whim led to a portly sum of 10,000 dollars, and a nice photo taken of Norman with the cheque. \"We've never had someone win at this location before!\" said the store owner enthusiastically, back in the day. Thing is, three weeks after that, Norman had won again, at the 7/11 across the street from the first gas station. Norman couldn't believe his luck, and when he won again the very next week at yet again the very next store, Norman believed his luck would never end. A framed photograph of Norman smiling gleefully with three equal sums of 10,000 dollars, placed above the battery rack and below the cigarettes, and when finally Norman's luck ended with a winnings of a diminished 50 dollar scratchie, the clerk was still nice enough to take one last framed photograph to concrete his legacy throughout the eight block radius.\n\nA lot had changed about Norman in the last fifteen years. 20,000 of the 30,050 in winnings went towards his wedding, 5,000 going towards the honeymoon, and four years later, after the last bit cash disappeared in bills and an arduous amount of lottery tickets, nothing was left to cover the cost of the divorce. Norman never stopped frequenting the convenient stores, the stores with *90's* Norman staring and smiling from behind the counter, with that happy, lucky, grinning, *smug* face of his.\n\n \"Not who sure you're talking about.\" Norman told the man with large hair. The man was perplexed, looking at Norman, then to the photo on the wall, and then back to Norman. He scratched his head.\n\n\"Now listen here,\" scorned the old woman at the front, \"Three oranges is a *win!* I don't know what I'm entitled to, but I won... Something!\" The tired clerk took the scratchie. Finally reading the back of the ticket, the clerk learned that indeed the woman had won, and unknown to the both of them until now, she had won *big.*\n\n\"Mam... You won the jackpot.\" whispered the clerk, in awe.\n\n\"I knew it!\" \n\n\"... You won a million dollars...\"\n\n\"I... Oh...\"\n\nWhere words were failing her, the realization came across the audience, and soon everyone was cheering and jumping, hugging and shoulder rubbing, applauding and feeling a little bit jealous, and Norman, tired and wistful Norman, couldn't help but feel empathetic.\n\nSoon enough her photo was taken, Norman's 15 year old portrait removed from the wall, dusted and spit shined. The print of Young Norman was now tucked behind her grinning face. \n\nLater on, after Norman finally paid for his crisps and soda, Norman gave her a hug, and wished her the best of luck. \"I'm the luckiest Nancy in the whole wide world!\" she said, with her uncontrollable joy.\n" }

He considered rolling over and going back to sleep. But five minutes was hardly worth it. He also considered resetting the alarm to ring at 6:10. But then he might be late for work. He sighed. All this considering had woken him up and he could hear the cat that was also not Norman in the other room calling for breakfast. \n\nThe man who definitely couldn't be named Norman sat up and dangled his feet off the bed. The cold floor helped to bring him more awake as he meandered towards the bathroom. He disrobed and ran the hot water. Then he began to shower. As he was lathering his right buttock a shrill noise came from the other room. The alarm was going off. It was annoying. But since he had already begun to lather he finished his shower before going to turn it off. He hoped it hadn't bothered the neighbors.\n\nAfter handling the clock the man not named Norman went to the kitchen to feed his cat. He put toast in the toaster before pouring some kibble into the cat who is not named Norman's bowl. \n\n\"There you are Spike.\" said the man not named Norman. \"Eat up. It'll keep your coat nice and shiny.\"\n\nThe man who was not Norman sat down to eat his toast and plan his busy day." }

Norman thought he might try the new Mexican restaurant that opened a few weeks ago. \n\nAs Norman arrived at the new restaurant he saw that it wasn't actually open until next Friday. So he turned around and went to his normal place for lunch. Although he did order salsa with his cheeseburger.  It was probably better than the new restaurant anyway. " }

He had jus**\n\n*No!* Thought Norman as he held in backspace on his keyboard *Sylvester's a cat...I need something better.* After a moment, Norman had the perfect name for his protagonist.\n\n**Michael was having a rough morning. He had just spilled coffee on his shirt and had to be to work in less than 30 minutes. He ahd a very important meeting today and he didn't need any more problems.**\n\n*Very important meeting? That sounds really generic.* Norman wondered what kind of important meeting Michael could be having...*That's it!* He thought.\n\n**...He had to meet with his boss to discuss a complaint someone had filed against him yesterday and he really didn't need more on his mind right now.**\n\n*What would someone complain about though?* He wondered *Michael's a rebel, but he gets along fine with his co-workers.* Norman needed to take a sip of his own coffee, a pot he thought he had brewed very well this morning, as ideas ran through his head.\n\n*Ha, perfect. I should have thought of that sooner.* Norman mused joyfully as he began typing.\n\n**...The straight-laced rookie Jenkins had made a comment about Michael's unorthodox way of getting things done. Michael knew it wouldn't end there and he was sure it was the kid that had filed the complaint.**\n\nNorman was just hitting his stride when the telephone rang. He answered the phone and was happy to hear his Coworker Anthony on the other end.\n\n\"Hey Norm, ya busy?\"\n\n\"Uhh, no, not really\"\n\n\"Awesome, We're thinking of heading over to strikers and playing a few games and could really use a fourth. It's me, Jay and Dennis. Can you make it\"\n\n\"Uh, yeah, I'll be there in about twenty minutes\"\n\n\"Fantastic. See ya there.\"\n\n\"Alright. See you there. Bye\"\n\nNorman put his laptop away, very pleased with the progress he had made with his story. He got himself ready and made sure Norman had food and water, then headed out the door, greatly looking forward fun night with the guys." }
