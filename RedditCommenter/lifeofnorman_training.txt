He hardly even noticed the bus pulling up.\n\n\nWhen the driver asked if he was okay, he nodded and paid his fare from the change in his pocket.

{ "subreddit" : "lifeofnorman", "title" : "The Book of Norman- The Time Has(almost) Finally Come/The Writers Who Made the Final Cut", "text" : "(If you're interested in hearing some of the progress on the book over the last number of months, feel free to read this overly long speech. If you're here to see who made the cut, and why others did not, skip to the last two paragraphs.)\n\nHello all! After a long, long while, I'm here with another update. Unfortunately I stated that there was a final update, and that no other update would come after it, which somewhat made me a recluse when it came to sharing information. Most of my info let out was through people specifically asking me, \"What the hell are you doing with the book, Cameron!?\", and I realize that isn't fair that I made you all have to reach out to me to find out that info. Anyways, I have some news.\n\nThe book is finished. Finito. Completo. Donno. Sort of. The innards, all the stories, and all the edits, which there were many, are complete. Frankly, I've had enough stories included in the book since February; that being 365. However, things change. The tone of the book has shifted a lot since the conception of the project, and because of that, stories I collected at the beginning no longer lined up with the thought process I had near the end.\n\nSo more stories were collected. Newer, fresher, more in line with what I had in mind. Then, the book shifts again, and I realize there's only so many stories you can have of Norman missing the bus and getting caught in the rain. So I scrapped some repetition.\n\nSo more stories were collected. Now, people are starting to write plotlines on the subreddit! Lisa is born! Frank's a drunk! Norman gets some confidence! Ideas that were non-existent start to pop up. \"I wish I thought of that earlier\" turns into \"Damn, I can't *not* put this in the book.\" So more stories are cut, and more are added. Variety. Levels of skill in writers advance. Some people just disappear and I can't make edits to their story, forcing me to cut. \n\nSo more stories were collected. Now, it's just the best of the crop. Months after finishing, I'll find some damn good stories, better than anything already included. More is cut. More is added. More is cut, yadda yadda.\n\nThen I realized, this will never stop. So long as the subreddit exists, there will be more stories, better stories, than anything written thus far. It evolves. No matter how many rounds of edits I do, re-reading the exact same story two dozen times, there will undoubtedly be typos. I hope not, I did my best, but there will always be grammatical slips, like finding grains of sand in your shoe years later. \n\nSo now, the book is done. It's reached a point where I can be proud of what its become, something that I hope you'll all enjoy. The thing that let's me know it's good, is when I re-read a story, one I've read dozens of times, and known the punchline for a year, but still manage to crack a smile, or even feel a punch in the gut from. It's littered with remarkable talent, fun stories, cute illustrations, and the fine line of boring yet undeniably charming that Norman always had.\n\nThis is not the end, and I realize I should stop praising the final product before it even exists. Hell, the whole point of this post here was for one purpose- to show which writers made the cut. I feel that I should post it well ahead of time, since, as this post has hopefully made clear, I had to cut a lot of stories. I felt bad about it. After a while, I had to move the names of the writers away from the stories and number them instead, since some people were so sincere and heartfelt with me, that I just felt horrible removing their stories after I told them it'd be included. If you didn't make the list, know that I am sorry, that it was nothing personal, and it wasn't always because it was better or worse than what made the book. There was a bigger picture involved. Sometimes a fantastic story delves too far from the books set canon, and creates inconsistency with a dozen other stories. Sometimes there will be a story similar to three other stories, but only one of them hits the notes needed for that part of the book. Sometimes, people don't respond to me, and I didn't feel comfortable publishing an altered story. Things get cut.\n\nBut it was all for the best; to make this book to be in the best shape it can be, without strings attached. And so, without further ado, here's the list. To those of you included, you'll be receiving a PM shortly. Basically, I'll give you one last chance to see what your story is, if you're interested, and make sure that if I made any changes that you're not fine with, that you can have this last chance to pull out or work it out with me. \n\n- /u/samuel2097\n- /u/renanFerrari\n- /u/Marine2014\n- /u/Xezer\n- /u/BatmanHimself\n\n- /u/RamsesThePigeon\n- /u/RUBY_FELL\n- /u/alien6\n- /u/Case_A\n-

Well, even though the book is finished, all the needed assets are not. I'm still waiting on artists and artwork, so forgive me. I'm very much hoping to have all the pieces finished in the next few weeks. Then, I'm going to order a review copy of the book, and if all is well, I'll publish it! Then, it'll be available for order through Amazon. \n\nI think a few weeks after that, I'll try and get the e-book version out there as well. One thing at a time. \n\nAs for people asking about pre-orders, know that there won't be anything. I'm a believer that pre-orders are just an excuse for money to be made before people find out whether or not a thing is good. So, buy it once it's out, or even after the early adopters tell you if it's worth the money.

He had gotten up, showered, had breakfast, read the paper, then did some chores around the house while humming a rather annoying yet catchy song he had had stuck in his head for a few days now.\n\nHe was in the middle of doing the dishes when the doorbell rang. Curious, Norman dried off his hands and went to the door. \n\n\"Afternoon sir\", the man in the UPS uniform said to him as he handed Norman a small but heavy package. As the delivery man was already on his way back to his van, Norman had just enough time to mutter \"Thanks\", all the while trying to remember what he'd ordered.\n\nStill racking his brain, Norman put the package on the kitchen table and removed the brown paper around it. \"I don't know either, Norman\", he told his cat that was looking at him quizzically.\n\nIn the package were three dark bottles of ale, centered around a big beer mug. There was plastic wrapping around it, with a little bow lint on top. Attached to it was a card. Norman opened it.\n\n**\"Happy Father's Day, Dad! :) X Norm Jr. &amp; Jess\"**\n\nFor what seemed like minutes, Norman couldn't move.

His manager was giving a presentation. As the stream of words drifted through the room, Norman began to notice that he felt rather tired. Odd, since he’d gotten his usual eight hours of sleep, and had drunk the same warm cup of coffee with cream that he always drank. A friendly bank teller had persuaded him yesterday to have a piece of hard candy, and he wondered sleepily if that could be the root of his lethargy. He’d read somewhere that too much sugar can affect sleep quality.\n\nAfter a short time, Norman noticed that he was having trouble focusing on his manager’s presentation, having missed the last few sentences. What’s more, Norman felt a yawn coming on. Now, Norman is not usually one to draw attention to himself, especially in such a professional atmosphere. He started to become worried – what if his manager thought that Norman was not engaged with the presentation? Norman did not want to consider the ramifications of such a thought, and though he feared making a scene, the urge to yawn was creeping slowly but steadily through his body.\n\nThen a strange and new thought occurred to Norman. He realized that he really WASN’T engaged in the presentation. He WAS rather bored by his manager today. Perhaps, Norman thought, I AM willing to shake things up a little, and give a good yawn. Nothing big, nothing flashy, just a nice, satisfying yawn.\n\nAs Norman considered it, he liked the idea more and more. He sat up and prepared himself for his act of rebellion. By this time, however, he found that he was much too excited, and the urge to yawn had left him entirely.\n\nNo more candy for me, Norman thought.

He sometimes listens to polkas, for Christ's sake-\" Norm punctuated his comment with an awkward chuckle. \"Always wanted to make a model train set with me, but my Mom left to be with Randy and she told me about how cool he was and how I should live with her and Randy and we never got the chance. I'd almost want to do it now, just to see what Dad's up to.\"\n\nThose stilleto nails summoned a box of Kleenex from a drawer as if they had read Norm's mind. \"You take your time\", Carol's voice was emotional aloe vera. \n\n\"Randy was all about wild shit,\" Norm tried and failed to hide his contempt. \"Big pecs, drank everyone under the table, screamed at the television with his buddies and went to the gym constantly.

He flipped the small, simple device open and uttered \"H-hello?\"\n\n\"Uh... hello. Norman, ehem, this is Lisa, from work...\"\n\nNorman's heart raced, was there some sort of work emergency that only he was capable of resolving? He wasn't sure he could handle the pressure. \n\n\"I, uh... I saw something weird the other day on lunch break,\" Lisa confessed.\n\nNorman relaxed slightly, but still, his mind raced as to what could possibly have been so important as to reach out to him on the weekend. \"Oh, what's that?\" He inquired.\n\n\"Look, I'll just send you a link, I still have your personal email.\" \n\nNorman thought for a moment, but then recalled that they had exchanged emails when they both were among those chosen at the office to arrange the holiday party; Norman was still proud of the rousing and bawdy event he had a hand in creating.

He hoped he had clicked the right one.\n\n\"You've got mail!\" the computer chimed.\n\n\"Success!\" Norman thought to himself.\n\nHe combed through his new emails, there were seven. He started by clicking the oldest one, he didn't want to be rude to whoever sent it, and make them wait.\n\n\"Cheap RX Canadian warehouse pharma megadeals,\" Norman read, he opened the email and began to read. It was typical medical jargon he was sure was beyond his paygrade, but on the off chance they might have something cheap to take care of Norman's hairballs, he clicked the embedded link. The computer thought and thought, but nothing came up. Suddenly he remembered his curiosity had him on a mission - he eyed the remaining emails until he saw Lisa's username. The subject line simply said \"lifeofnorman.\"\n\nNorman opened the email. It contained only a single link, \"www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman.\"\nHis curiosity was fully in control now, and he hovered his cursor over the link, when a shrill dinging came over the speakers. \n\n\"Ding ding ding; Threat has been detected!\"\n\nNorman panicked, as he broke into a cold sweat.

He'd never been to an all-you-can-eat buffet before. \n\nThe next day at work, Norman spent his lunch break looking at the website for the restaurant. There was a list of all the foods included on the buffet and Norman carefully wrote down exactly what foods he wanted to get on each trip. He planned on pacing himself so he didn't get too stuffed and tired. He had two episodes of CSI recorded that he planned on watching when he got home. \n\nFinally, it was time! Norman got in his car and drove to the restaurant. He arrived at 5:15, and as it was still early in the evening, he was seated immediately. A young blonde waitress arrived to take his order. She let him know that the special that night was the all-you-can-eat buffet and that it was $14.99. Norman ordered an Arnold Palmer to drink since it was the weekend and told the  waitress he would have the buffet. She smiled and told him to go ahead and grab a plate from the stack and enjoy his dinner. \n\nHe shuffled up to the buffet line and grabbed a plate. He consulted the note in his pocket detailing what food items to get. His first course was to be a salad. He piled on a small mound of iceberg lettuce, some cheddar cheese, and tomatoes. In another corner he added a small scoop of cole slaw. He wanted ranch dressing but he didn't see any and didn't want to be a bother, so he ladled on French instead. He found a cup for soup and poured himself a small bowl of chicken noodle. That would do for the first round. Nothing too filling right away.

But Norman merely kept his eyes fixed firmly on the sidewalk as he walked by, and that had always served him well.\n\nThis particular Saturday, however, that changed.\n\"Hey, excuse me!\" came a high pitched voice from behind Norman.\nNorman turned around to find a teenage girl standing behind him, her two friends standing nearby watching and giggling. She had dark skin and dark hair, and was sucking on a red lollipop while eyeing Norman speculatively. Without waiting for a response, she asked \"Can you do me a favor?\"\n\nNorman was conflicted. His first instinct was to say \"Sure!\", and he even opened his mouth to say this before a second thought hit him and he hesitated. His next instinct was to say \"Depends on what it is.\", but that seemed very rude and presumptuous.

It wasn't unusual in color or shape, of course; Norman found it unusual because he expected to encounter only four pieces of mail, and here was a fifth! It was quite thick, and for a moment Norman had a rush of excitement at the thought of opening it. Before this dream came to fruition, however, he noticed that, while the address was correct, the name on the envelope was actually Lisa's. He chuckled to himself. Yet another company newsletter had swapped their addresses, despite the complaints they had both filed. (Complaint was a strong word, Norman mused. He wasn't actually perturbed by the incident, but \"complaint\" was the word on the top of the form, so \"complaint\" it was.) \n\n\"It's a nice day,\" Norman told Norman.\n\nSilence. \n\n\"I think I'll take a walk and put this into Lisa's mail slot myself.\" He said, a bit louder this time. The cat still did not respond. It was clear that the feline Norman had no opinion on the matter, so, after changing into a slightly older pair of khaki's (in case the wind kicked up and they got dirt on them), he departed. \n\nAfter knocking on Lisa's door several times, he came to the conclusion that she must be out. He bent over to stick the letter in the mail slot when an unusual thing happened- the letter wouldn't fit! It made sense to Norman, because the envelope truly was large, and perhaps the mail slot was on the small side as well. He had come all this way, however, and wasn't going to give up. He struggled with the sizing issue for a few seconds before the overstuffed A4 envelope reluctantly gave in. Norman was pleased with himself, and hoped that the contents were not too bent when Lisa opened them.\n\n\"Sorry I'm late,\" Norman told Norman as he walked through the door. Indeed, he was a good five minutes later than he had previously anticipated, and feline Norman was sitting by his food bowl impatiently. \n\n\"The letter didn't fit in the mail slot, so...\" At that very moment, he realized the perfect opportunity for a joke. It was something his son would have called a 'dad joke', but Norman thought this one was so clever that more than just *dads* would appreciate it.\n\n\"I guess you could say I was...\" He paused one more time for effect. \n\n\"*pushing the envelope*.\"\n\nHe guffawed so loudly that he accidentally spilled a few bits of the dry kibble he was scooping into the bowl. \n\nThe cat did not respond.", "comments" : [{ "comment" : "Indeed, no cats seem to have yet responded. :)\n\nWait, or is that :(?" }, { "comment" : "I feel like Norman would be a little bit conflicted about it.

He simply stood blinking for a few seconds, until he looked at the clock and saw that those few seconds actually were several minutes and that Norman was no longer even in his field of vision, as he had sauntered off to bathe himself casually as he muttered to himself about the poor quality of television these days. Even amid Norman's confusion about mere cat noises and language, he was able to eke out the thought that it was strange for Norman to remark upon TV things, as Norman had never owned one. He scratched his head wondering how he had ever watched CSI though, if that were the case... and then continued on wondering what Norman could possibly have been talking about in his strange cat-like way of being able to mutter disgruntled things while licking his hamstrings. Then he heard Norman say something about it always being the same show about the same 92 cars... Half of them would go in one direction early in the day, and then several hours later exactly the same number of identical cars would speed by in the opposite direction.\n\nNorman realized Norman was conflating windows with TVs, and suddenly he felt as though it all made sense: Norman simply hadn't understood his clever joke, and that's okay." }, { "comment" : "This is a true Norman story.

As he continued to rack his brain on what type of flower was on the shirt, a store assistant approached him. \n\n“Can I help you with something?” the assistant asked.\n \nStartled, Norman glanced up at the tall, slender young man - presumably in his twenties - who bore an amused smirk.\n\nEmbarrassed for shopping at a section where he felt he most certainly didn’t belong, Norman grabbed the shirt and tucked it behind his back.\n\n“No thanks, I’m fine,” Norman muttered and walked a little faster than he would’ve liked towards the register. \n\nMuch to Norman’s chagrin, he left the store with a shopping bag in hand containing a new shirt.

Sure, they had good beers available, but Norman wasn't a big beer drinker. He was a bigger fan of their dish, “Mount Nachos.”\n\nAs Norman sat at a bar-stool, happily eating his nachos, a band was starting to set up their instruments on the small stage in The Pub. The band members were all older men, somewhere in their forties, and each grunted and groaned excessively as they positioned their drum set, electric guitar, and bass guitar. Then a realization came over Norman.\n\nThis was his band from high-school.\n\nIt had been many decades, but Norman still remembered the band very clearly. Norman and the three men setting up on stage started a band in the 11th grade, called The Dusty Knucklers, and their specialty was hard rock. First there was Roger, the bass player. Back in the 80's, Roger was a heavy rocker, took style cues from David Bowie, and had a soft spot for Matilda, the bands muse. Norman had wondered where Matilda ended up after high-school. He had also wondered where Roger ended up as well- but it was answered for him this very night. Roger's hairline, as well as Tyler and Deacons, had fared well. The show began to start.\n\"Hello everyone, thanks for coming tonight!\" started Roger. He wiped the sweat from his forehead to slick back his long hair. Norman slicked back his hair as well, and wiped the excess sweat from his hand onto his pant-leg. \"We're the Wet Knucklers, and we hope you all have a good night. Party hard.\"\n\nThe old band started to play their songs; songs that Norman recognized well. The difference in the songs however, was the lack of Norman's keyboard. Norman wondered if he would still remember how to play a keyboard as well as he did then. It had been so many years…\n\nAfter an hour of playing, The Wet Knucklers put down their instruments and headed for the bar. Norman's heart began to pound intensely. *Would they recognize their old friend?*\n\nThe three men took a seat beside Norman. Norman's plate was clean. The band ordered a few beers.\n\"You guys did great tonight!\" cheered the bartender. As a bonus, he lined up shots for them.\n\nTyler smiled. \"Thanks mate. Always appreciate the compliments.\"\n\n\"So,\" started the bartender, \"You play hard rock, but no one on the keyboard? Seems like a missed opportunity.\"\n\n\"We used to have an keyboard player,\" said Roger, solemnly, \"back when we started the band. But we vowed to never have another one again. Not after Norman.\"\n\nNorman's heart sank. *Did they really not like me?*\n\n\"Why not? Did the guy just suck?\"\n\nRoger gulped down his beer, shaking his head as he swallowed. \"Not at all. He was a great player. But one day he left the band and... well... he died.\"\n\n\"How did he die, if you mind me asking?\"\n\n\"We heard it was from a heart attack. That happened about a year out of high school... I don't know, mate. It just doesn't feel right to replace him; you know?\"\n\n\"I understand.\" said the bartender sympathetically. \"Here- let me get you another round of shots.\"\n\nThe bartender poured another row of shots for the band. Everyone was silent- including Norman. Who said he was dead? Did no one look into it? Did everyone from his childhood assume he died?\n\n\"For Norman.\" said Tyler.\n\n\"For Norman.\" said Deacon.\n\n\"For Norman.\" said Roger.\n\nNorman wanted to say something- anything- but he couldn't find it in him. A tightness in his chest stopped him from being able to say a word. He hoped they might recognize him, that they would do him the favor of starting the conversation, but he knew it was hopeless.

He did not enjoy pairing things up - life was much easier when all of his socks were aesthetically apathetic.\n\nBut it wasn't just the colour. They had to be of the same brand: \"Filmores Black Socks\". And they had to be cotton-rich. He imagined the Kings of England wearing them in bed, swivelling their heels and soles together in shear delight.\n\nNorman estimated that his socks' useful life stretched across about two years. Their relatively short life-span was the price to be paid for luxury. He had calculated that his socks of 2014 would soon be reaching their expiry date and so he had made an appointment with the menswear department.\n\nA lot had happened in two years. Now, the elasticated landscape spanned shelves ranging from hiking socks to a grotesque hybrid of sock and slipper. Norman carefully negotiated his way to the 'no-nonsense' section. He examined the rank and file of black socks and finger-walked his way to 'Filmores'.\n\nExcept they weren't 'Filmores'. They were a sock species called 'Flagmores. Norman closed his eyes and squeezed a bunch. No, they were not the same. They were not Filmores. There were no Filmores.\n\nWithout thinking, he took one of the impostors in hand and made his way to the checkout. He rationalised: he wasn't complaining, he was merely asking. He was going to place the Flagmores on the counter and say \"Sorry to be a nuisance but I was hoping you could tell me where I can find a pair of Filmores.\" Perfectly reasonable. Perhaps putting them on the counter might seem a little combative, like throwing down the sock gauntlet. No, he was only asking: the Flagmores were for reference; they weren't a weapon.\n\nHe arrived at a queue and clipped himself in at the back. He wondered whether he could buy Filmores from the internet but that didn't feel right. \n\nThe counter was only two arm's length away now. Only one customer stood between him and his question, an older woman wearing a silk kerchief around her neck. He craned over her shoulder and saw that she was buying a pair of Flagmores. The cashier looked pained. Silkerchief picked up the Flagmores and waggled them in the air like an eagle its prey.\n\n\"I've been coming to this store for over twenty years and you try and pass these off as the real thing?\"\n\nThe cashier grimaced, \"I'm sorry madam.”\n\nSilkerchief leaned in “I don’t think you understand. I came into town especially to buy Filmores. These,”  - she let the socks dribble off her hands onto the counter - “are  of an inferior quality. I daren’t use the term knock-off in an establishment such as this but these” - and this she whispered - “are second-rate.\"\n\nThe cashier stood unblinking as his hands found the phone, \"I will speak to the manager.\"\n\nSilkerchief crossed her arms: \"O.K.\" She turned around and, seeing Norman's Flagmores, raised her eyes to the heavens.\n\nThe cashier delivered a strangled mutter into the handset as Norman tucked the socks under his armpit. \"The manager will be with us shortly he flat-smiled.\" The cashier motioned to Norman. \n\nThe complainant took a staccato step to the side and Norman fell into place. He looked to the cashier then back at Silkerchief. He felt the Flagmores swell in his armpit. \n\n“Can I help you sir?” asked the cashier.\n\n“Uh,” Norman enunciated carefully.\n\n“Do you need a bag for them?” the cashier pointed at the swelling.\n\n“Uh.” Norman whisper-shouted. \"I’ve forgotten something.” Norman swivelled on his heel and retreated back into the store.

It seemed like fate that he walked away with a $25 gift card to his favorite restaurant.\n\nAs the waitress leaned in to grab Norman’s plate, she placed the check face down on the table. “Whenever you’re ready” she said, smiling as she walked away. On any other occasion this moment would have given Norman anxiety as he hated to depart with his hard earned money, but with the gift card in his pocket he reached for the check with a confident grin.\n\nNorman calculated the meal perfectly: Diet Soda - $3, 8oz Steak (Well Done) a la carte - $11, Chocolate Cake $6. After tax, that left enough remaining on the gift card to give the waitress a 15% tip. The service wasn’t great, but Norman felt that leaving anything less than a 15% tip would be rude. \n\nHowever, when Norman grabbed the check and glanced down at the total his sense of confidence deflated like a balloon- $24.63. But how, he wondered. Anxious and confused, he brushed the beads of sweat forming on his brow and reviewed the breakdown of his bill. He noticed the problem instantaneously. The waitress charged his steak as a meal and not a la carte. \n\n“Is something wrong, sir?” \n\nIn his state of disbelief Norman hadn’t noticed the waitress approach the table to retrieve the check. Norman shifted in his chair as he looked up at the waitress, and folded the receipt as if hiding the mistake on the bill would help avoid the waitress from prodding any further. \n\n“No…no. Everything is fine” he replied as he reached for the gift card in his pocket and handed it to the waitress. \n\n“Ok, I’ll be right back.” The waitress left and Norman breathed a sigh of relief at the small victory. Yet, the problem remained. What would he leave as a tip? He pulled out his black leather wallet and searched for cash but found none. Then, he considered giving the waitress his debit card when she returned and ask that she run the tip on that. However, he quickly dismissed the idea in fear of inconveniencing the waitress. Plus, the extra minutes spent running the card would make him arrive home late and miss the beginning of his favorite show. \n\n “Here you are, sir. Have a great rest of your night.” The waitress returned quicker than Norman anticipated. Norman returned her pleasantries with a nod; avoiding eye contact with the waitress, hoping she wouldn’t see his panic stricken face. \n\nFacing defeat, Norman grabbed the pen to sign off on the bill. The tip of the pen met the receipt as he attempted to sign his name, but the pen was dry. Then the idea hit him.\n\nNorman exited the restaurant.

So confident, that he got sloppy.\n\nAnd so, one day, right before lunch, Norman found himself in dire need of the bathroom. He stood up, did not look through windows, did not listen for footsteps, but simply walked towards the bathroom in a desperate but determined stride. He did his deed, washed his hands, dried them using the special one-handtowel technique he saw on some TED talk, and got ready to leave when he awoke from his flow with a sudden shock as the handle of the bathroom door was being pushed down from the other side.\n\nBefore Norman even had the time to figure out his reaction, he found himself staring into the face of an unknown man. This was it, then. The moment Norman had tried to avoid for so long, and at the door of the toilet of all places... and when Norman looked into Pete's eyes, he saw there the same doubts, the same fears, the same desperation, and he could almost feel how their mental processes were moving in sync. This made Norman smile, and when he did the unknown face smiled back, and then nodded. Norman nodded back, and they moved around each other in the elegant yet robust dance that only males in shared toilets learn: one out, one in.\n\nBack at his desk, Norman sat down, looked out of the bit of window he could see, and smiled again.

While Norman’s ascetic lifestyle typically prevented him from having much to contribute to the aforementioned garage sale, he always tried to find an item or two to sell. A pair of shoes that rubbed his heel wrong. A button-down that had been liberated of a few of its buttons. Things that were still useful, but not to him.\n\nThis year Norman elected to check the attic. He seemed to remember stashing a few of Melinda’s things up there, and he was certain he would find some of Norman Jr’s old toys as well.\n\nIt had been years since Norman ventured into the attic. He noticed immediately that some of the insulation had fallen down. *A chore for another day*, Norman thought. He rummaged through old boxes of bowling trophies and wondered why he had stopped playing. He seemed to remember Melinda disliking that he came home smelling like cigarettes. *But smoking is banned in most places now. I don’t need to worry about smoke any longer*, he mused, and then he remembered that he no longer needed to worry about Melinda either.\n\nAmongst the detritus Norman found Norman Jr’s Big Wheel, sun-faded and missing a rear wheel, an old baseball mitt, and eight large Rubbermaid containers filled with Legos. Norman stuffed the baseball mitt into his back pocket and began hauling the Legos out of the attic.\n\nAfter wiping the copious amount of dust off the Rubbermaids, Norman opened each one. Each box was organized by color, and in one of the boxes he found a three-ring binder containing the directions for all of the sets he and Melinda bought for Norman Jr. Pirate ships and castles. Spaceships and cattle ranches. Norman sat down amongst the boxes and flipped through all directions. There was a time in Norman’s youth when he would have ignored the manuals and simply let his imagination build whatever it pleased, but now the thought of not following the instructions made Norman’s palms sweat. He settled on a model of a plane. He thought it looked like a crop duster, and he always enjoyed watching crop dusters come in close to the ground, close enough to touch it seemed, and then soar back up into the air again, unreachable.\n\nAt first the build went smoothly. The plane used a lot of standard size pieces, and finding them within the boxes was easy. However, when he got to the more intricate parts of the plane, the pieces became increasingly difficult to find. *Why didn’t organize these by type*, he thought, *That would’ve made this much simpler.* But Norman was committed. After an hour or so, he had completed his airplane. He set it upon the coffee table and then laid down on the couch. \n\nMuch to his surprise, Norman napped. While he slept, Norman had joined him on the couch, curling up on his abdomen and partaking in a nap of his own. Norman awoke to Norman’s soft purring and the kneading of his paws. “We must’ve been tired, Norman.

He was certainly going to be extremely festive.\n\nThe day of the party arrived, and Norman was in high spirits. He arrived at the party 15 minutes late, exactly as his father had told him to do in cases like these. He had done his homework beforehand, and it occurred to him that his father actually was right about the timing of these things. Normally Norman would show up exactly on time, but his father had informed him that most people will not be there at that time, and it will be very awkward.\n\nAt the party, Norman started saying hello and talking to all of the coworkers that were already there. He made some friendly chatter about the weather and office going-ons, and generally had a pleasant time. Some people even complimented his special sweater, which made Norman very happy.\n\nA little later, Norman was feeling thirsty, so he went to get a glass of punch.

Norman said hello, and tried to hold back the enormous smile that wanted to come out, instead only letting his regular, more reserved smile show. Lisa started complimenting Norman on his sweater, and Norman complimented her dress, and then the two of them entered into a conversation.\n\nLisa then offered to fill Norman's cup for him, to which Norman happily obliged.

He decided not to possibly wake Norman by going into his room to get appropriate clothes for going outside, so he risked going out in his pajamas.  \n\nNorman opened his front door and walked to his mail box.

Was he happy with his current electricity company? Yes, he was. The letter said if he was, to read no further. Norman, always respectful of people's wishes, folded the letter and read no further.   \n\nFinally, the fancy envelope. Norman looked to see who it was from and felt his curiosity less than sated. It appeared someone had dropped the envelope in some winter slush and the return address was smudged and unreadable.   This was addressed directly to him. His name was handwritten neatly across the front of the cream colored envelope. He turned it over, noting a cute little sticker on the envelopes seal, though it was completely unnecessary as the envelope had also been sealed shut, but Norman appreciated the gesture. He opened the card and pulled it out.

Although Norman knew the stores were quite busy on Saturday afternoons, he didn't want to be one to let his wife down, and smiled halfheartedly at the idea.\n\nHaving arrived in the parking lot at the hardware store, Norman's wife suggested he go in alone so she could get a head start at the houseware store.  Somewhat caught off guard by her uncharacteristic desire for efficiency, he let out a genuine sigh of relief, knowing that he would be able to browse the hardware store's limited and simple selection of picture frames in private.  The frame housing the picture of their son's baseball team was far too gaudy for Norman's taste.\n\nNorman selected a frame that was quite pleasing to him; although made from the more expensive oak and featuring a walnut stain, he was surprised to see it was on sale and was soon walking towards the houseware store on the other side of the complex, frame in hand.\n\nAfter circling the store several times, Norman was unable to locate his wife.  He had already sent her one text message regarding his purchase and didn't want to bother her with further messages.  The anxiety he was feeling made him shift uneasily in the bedding department.  Norman closed his eyes and remembered the teachings of the book his wife gave him for his last birthday.

He opened his flip phone, palms sweaty: \"Have you made it to the houseware store yet? I'm in the kitchen department\".  Odd, he thought to himself, he had been there at least three times.  Relief rushed over Norman as he laid eyes on his beloved browsing the selection of spatchulas.  \"I thought I'd lost you\" Norman confessed.\n\n\"Oh Norman, I'm so sorry it took you this long to find me, you know I've been telling you to get your glasses checked.\" Of course she was right, it was just like he read earlier how vision always drops off at the age of 45.

All these people that had gathered here, and from them not a single scream was heard, nor a broken cry, nee, not even a breathless whisper escaped their lips. He couldn't believe it. Were they really oblivious to the terror so rapidly approaching them? How were they able to sit there so casually, on the field of grass, with the picnic blanket and the sleeping dogs? He felt like the only man alive, yet unable to make a difference as he could feel the giant feet soundlessly come nearer.\n\nAs he stood there, his feet rooted to the ground, he realized that to continue this silence was to continue the beast. He tried to scream, but his voice wasn't there. As his body failed him, his mind jumped into action. The determined focus that had been a part of him for as long as he could remember, that often burdensome quality which seemed to make him a bore to the world, was suddenly hard at work. He closed his eyes and listened. The quiet now seemed almost overwhelming, but his focus had grown so strong that even the thought of a sound made the tiny hairs in his ears tingle.\n\nAnd there it was. At first it was less than a whisper. But with continuing attention it grew louder, until it was like a breeze. Louder, and a memory clicked in place: he saw the waves crashing into the shore and heard their gentle swooshing. Louder still it grew, as he started walking towards the ocean, that now seemed to beckon him with its sloshing call. He started running, arms swinging wildly around his body, his mind entranced by the pull of the waves. He ran into the surf and fell to his knees. He reached his arms up to the heavens, opened his mouth and let out a cry of desperation, \"POSEIDON!\".\n\nAs the waves gently engulfed him he saw how the heavens opened, and a bright white light appeared that grew bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and biggger and biiggher ant bijghjerrrrrr bjghrrrrrr, bjghrrrrr, bjghrrrrr, bjghrrrruurrhhrhrh ugh.\n\nNorman scratched his head. It was still dark outside. The Ocean alarm tone was nice, he thought, but he should really switch off the vibrate function. Still drowsy, he clicked through the app's settings to find it.

His father always used to say, \"If it won't work easily, don't force it\". This decision did not feel easy. Norman pressed the \"Home\" button, closed the app, and locked his phone. \"Why am I on my phone first thing in the morning?\", he asked himself. \"That's not a healthy way to start the day\". This got him thinking about healthy ways to start the day, health food, vegans, alternative medicine, the New Age movement, and he suddenly thought of a colleague of his who was always talking about dreams, and finding meaning in them. He wasn't sure whether any of that was true or not, but he had so far found himself unable to explain what exactly dreams are.\n\nHe remembered being in a dream, but forgot what it was about. Something to do with being boring and everything was quiet. He tried closing his eyes, as his colleague had told him, to get back into the dream state. This sounded very appealing, and so he dozed off for a moment, until a sudden thought, \"Work!\", awoke him with a shock. \"I'll think about the dream later\", Norman said to himself, his voice sounding somewhat determined.\n\nAs soon as he poured the milk over his cornflakes, he had forgotten about it.\n\n", "comments" : [{ "comment" : "It's a bit long, but I was content with it." }, { "comment" : "A bit long, but I got OP as extra to go with it." }, { "comment" : "Never apologize for a long Norman story that's well written.

Already from his vantage point across the street he could see a metal staircase, and he wondered where it would lead. His mind raced with the possibilities.\n\nHe then realized that it was probably a bad idea to get involved; he might run into people who would ask him to leave, and that would be pretty embarrassing.

As he was perusing, he noticed the store was having a sale on perishables. Blood rushing to his head, he filled his trolley with milk, eggs, bread, and a jar of grape jam that, while not on sale, he was *sure* he had a coupon for in his billfold. Carefully taking his wallet out, he peered inside. There were 3 coupons: a buy-one-get-one-free offer for an off-brand detergent that made his clothes scratchy, an expired newspaper clipping that advertised 5$ off of an extra large pizza from his favorite pizza place, and - **THERE!** - a coupon for ¢50 off of grape jam.\n\nSmiling, Norman carefully placed the jar in the back of the trolley. He made sure not to forget Norman's food on the next aisle over, and made his way to the cashier. A large, greasy-faced teenager greeted him unenthusiastically. After ringing up Norman's items, he asked \"Paper or plastic, sir?\" Norman was about to tell him that he brought his own bag, but froze. He didn't remember bringing it with him. He tried to think quickly, so as to avoid an embarrassing encounter. He had too many heavy items for a paper bag, he thought. \"Those bags are so flimsy, surely they would tear open as I'm walking home,\" He muttered to himself.

Would the cashier think less of him for choosing a harmful plastic bag?\n\nWithout saying a word, Norman scooped up his purchases in his arms and quickly walked out the door. \"That was close\" he said, to no one in particular.

Or are you one of those heretics who ruin their tea with sugar?\" Gladys had wasted no time in getting tea ready for her guests.

It would not do to be a nuisance.\n\nDeftly dodging an assortment of leaves near the window, Gladys navigated the tea tray to her tiny coffee table.

Anyways, you should get the tickets today or tomorrow. I'll see you at Convocation.\"\n\nShit. Norm was upset. No \"I love you\" - not even a goodbye. Face pursed, she scoured the mail that Randy had crudely piled on the table and found the tickets. As her finger traced the crest of her alma mater on the envelope Julia fretted. Why was Norm so cold towards Randy? Randy was a part of their family. And besides, seeing Norman would be upsetting. He had never taken Norm skiing in the Alps, or on safari, or even to sports camp.

She had already organized the caterers. She read somewhere that scrapbooks were in, so she had hired some woman off Etsy to make the thing. Julia had been putting off digging through the albums to send scrapbook content to the Etsy woman. It wasn't like Randy would do it. Once again, Julia thought, I have to do everything.\n\nAt the sight of the dusty albums Julia felt a deep stab of guilt in her soul and remembered why she was putting it off.\n\nIf there was anything Julia regretted most about the divorce it was not telling Norman where the family photo albums went. Norman was adamant about photographing their young family - it was something between a vocation and a hobby. He wasn't bad at it either. There were pictures of baby Norm in a wagon, Norm with Julia's parents, Norm as a toddler in a bumblebee costume - all gold.\n\nAs she organized the future contents of the scrapbook into a parcel Julia ruminated.

I see how \"beige\" as a colour is considered \"boring\", and I could make some argument about how Norman isn't necessarily that, but I'd rather simply focus on beige as a colour for a bedroom in itself. How realistic is it? Don't get me wrong: The idea itself, of Norman having to choose a colour then returning with only a slight variety of it, is really good. But I know I've never seen a beige bedroom before, and I imagine it would look ugly. I have seen plenty of ugly bedrooms, but never a beige one. Always some ugly green or ugly yellow or some shit.\n\nSo I think the beige doesn't make sense, and replacing it with another colour (like \"cream\", which is a much more popular variety of wall paint) would have the added effect of taking away that cliche reference to boredom that is, all said and done, not really apt. \n\nOf course in the end this is your story, so please consider the above as a simple suggestion, which you can freely discard if you believe me to be wrong :)\n\nThanks for submitting your story to Norman's legacy!" }, { "comment" : "I actually work in a paint store.

From reading the stories and comments here, I think some people here may agree with me, but some definitely do not. On with the show.\n\nAbout the junk mail in his mailbox, it's less concrete than what you are getting at. It's much more about denial in Norman. Norman knows it's not possible that he would have skipped over an email without reading it, but if he can't turn that impossibility into a slim possibility, what can he hold on to? What I think is the beauty about Norman is the way that he's constructed the same way as a very depressive character, but is toned down to the extreme so that the depressive behavior is minimized to the point of meaninglessness when compared to general behavior in the lives of the readers and others in the real world. One element (or symptom) of this depression is denial: how people create perceptions and events for themselves to hold on to in order to preserve something in their life. Norman does just this, and the thing he's preserving is the idea that he hasn't moved completely into blandness of character and feeling yet: that he has the ability to become a real and feeling person.\n\nNorman creates all of these little things for himself (like leaving the junk mail in his mailbox) in order to let himself continue to pretend that he has this ability to become \"real\" and to escape the dullness of his current person. Most people have things in their lives that clearly give meaning to their life. If they ever ask the question \"What is the point in my life?\", they can come up with a reasonable answer based on these concrete things. Norman doesn't have these things. All he has is a series of events that have no meaning to his life whatsoever. Norman has only one choice possible to him, and that is to pretend subconsciously that these events do contain snippets of that meaning he is searching for that for him can never exist." }, { "comment" : "Alright, I guess I get it.

Norman slowly stretched out while staring at the bedroom door. On a tired dresser to Norman’s left sat two photos in identical frames and a daily pill organizer with one day remaining. The first photo was a black-and-white shot from a long time ago, and the other was of Norman sitting sphinx-like on the couch. All was normal here. Feet fell on plush beige carpet and Norman headed down the hall, dodging some socks that hadn’t made it to the laundry hamper. The apartment definitely had to be cleaned up a little. Even the two degrees hanging in the bedroom were lazily askew.\n\nNorman turned the corner, passing the washroom and the washer/dryer while looking towards the closet at the end of the hall. Nothing seemed off here. Oddly quiet, perhaps. Norman turned to take a look at the front door. Nothing. Hmm. Ah, well. Suddenly, a pang of hunger. Time for a snack.\n\nNorman started for the kitchen by walking through the living room. The drapes had been pulled closed and the sparsely-furnished room as a result sighed a tired, lifeless shade of blue. The old wood-panelled television lay dead against the wall, staring blankly at the once-luxurious brown couch that Norman had known and loved for so very long. An old handmade quilt limped across the arm of the couch and onto the floor, grazing the half-finished crossword that lay awkwardly sprawled over the other cushions. Norman stopped to scratch an itch before continuing.\n\nHooking through the dining room, past the cheap tablecloth flopping over a formica table as if resigned to a grave fate, Norman reached the kitchen. Norman sat a moment in there to enjoy some food and a quick drink. Sunlight creeped into the kitchen through the window in the next room. A crayon drawing of a house and a photo of Norm as a child clung to the fridge by way of a souvenir magnet from London. Norman had never been there. The clock, a tacky affair that looked like a black cat clicked its eternal temporal rhythm. Norman watched the counterweight swing for a few seconds before moving on.\n\nThe rich smell of old books and the gentle kiss of sunlight greeted Norman in the library. This was the warmest room in the house, handsomely housing a fastidiously-curated book collection. But today Norman had another reason for enjoying this room so much. A forgotten cup of tea and a flipped-over sci-fi novel sat together on the wooden endtable next to the chair. The table on the other side of the recliner held Norman’s record player. Milk crates full of records sat loyally underneath the table. The pillow usually tucked against the back of the big plush recliner had fallen over in the sun.

He had just emerged from his bedroom, wearing an old tee shirt and flannel pants, and started working to the kitchen. He stepped on his linoleum floor, noticing the sound his slippers made on the floor.\n\n\"Hmm. I feel like I'm making a ruckus. What do you think, Norman?\" Norman simply nuzzles his flannel pant leg, in hopes of a snack himself. \"I'll turn on the tv, that should drown out the noise.\"\n\nHe quickly returned to the living room, turned on the tv and settled on a volume that wasn't too loud, and didn't bother changing the channel because he didn't want to caught up in whatever show was on.\n\nHe returned to the kitchen, grabbed a plate and pulled out some turkey, cheese, and grabbed the bread from the top of the fridge. He tore off a tiny piece of turkey, which was low sodium because he thought it would be better for him, and dropped it on the floor in front of Norman, who jumped with delight as he started to eat it. While Norman was preoccupied he put a few slices of turkey on a slice of bread, then a single slice of cheese, then the top slice of bread. He put everything back in the fridge, and walked, with his planted sandwich, to his favorite chair and pulled a tray table towards him.\nHe looked at the sandwich, his stomach growling slightly, and told himself that he was going to wait until he decided on what to watch. He reached on the coffee table for his remote, but his hand couldn't find it. He switched his gaze to the coffee table, thinking he moved it from it's spot but it wasn't anywhere in the table.\n\"That's odd,\" he said to Norman, who was licking his face trying to get every last flavor of turkey that remained. \"Do you see it under the table?\" Norman just looked up at him, and gave a very content 'mrow'. Norman stood up and looked on the other tables in the living room, none of which had the remote on it. He looked under the coffee table, and then under the chair. Nothing. He digs around in the sides and under the cushion of the chair, and he still couldn't find it.\n\n\"Oh goodness,\" he muttered.\n\nHe went over to the bookcase and looked on each shelf, hoping he left it there by mistake. But, unfortunately, it wasn't there. He scratched his head in confusion, checked his pockets, and walked back into the kitchen.\n\"They should have a bell on these things. I mean, come on, where could I have left it?\" Norman walked to the fridge, and noticing it wasn't there he walked back to the living room where Norman had jumped up on the tray table and was sniffing around on his plate. \"Norman, no! I already gave you some turkey. If you get down now, there's a good chance I'll give you another piece.\" As if listening, Norman jumped off the table and laid right next to the chair.\n\nNorman sat down, pulled the tray table towards him, and with a sigh he bit into the sandwich. \"At least the bread's soft.\"\nHe gazed up and started watching whatever was on tv. It was the end of a documentary on inmate life in prison. They went into detail on what food was available through commissary, and how inmates use food as money.\n\"Norman, can you believe you can buy all these things with just food?\" Norman looked up just as Norman dropped another piece of turkey, and this time he pawed at it before eating it. Norman was on his last bite of the sandwich and before he got up to put the dish in the sink he pet Norman and said \"Good thing we're not in prison, Norman. I don't think I'd know how to price food, for all I know I could've bought another Norman with that turkey.\"\n\nNorman meowed at him, stretching. \"Oh, Norman, you know I would never get another Norman.

Norman decided it would be a good day to take a stroll along the beach; it wouldn't be too busy at this time. With each step, the wet sand consumed his feet, grinding between his toes. The scent of the salty ocean swept up into his nostrils with each crashing wave, clearing his head as well as his sinuses. Norman had been worrying all week about the presentation on Monday, but today his mind felt fresh and liberated.\n\nSuddenly, something hard collided with his toe. Norman looked down. The end of his toenail had cracked ever so slightly, but there in front of his feet was a glass bottle. He picked it up, pulled out the cork, and discovered a wet, rolled up piece of paper inside. He unravelled it, reading as best he could the smudged words. It read simply this:\n\nTo whom it may concern,\nI am writing this letter because I am lonely. It is my fortieth birthday today, and I am celebrating by signing divorce papers. You don't know me, you don't even know what I look like, but I really believe I am a good person at heart. I have a lot to give. I just fell for the wrong man, who left me utterly lost and alone. I have no friends, no family. I just want someone to sweep me off my feet, someone to make me happy, someone to hold me at night. I just want... someone. Even if it's just a friend, or a shoulder to cry on. Maybe you're in a similar situation to me. Maybe we could help each other. Make each other happy again.\n\nShe provided details of her whereabouts. Apparently, she could be found sitting on a red bench at the top of a hill at a local park Norman knew well (he was connoisseur of walking routes after all) at precisely midday every Sunday. It was obvious nobody had come across this letter yet. If they had, and if they had intended to pay a visit to this mysterious woman, they'd have most likely kept the letter.\n\nNorman placed it delicately inside the bottle, and squeezed the cork back in, carrying it along the beach. He approached a lifeguard, sat in his high chair.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" he said. \"I found this on the beach just over there. Could you please tell me where I can dispose of it? I wouldn't want anyone to accidentally step on it and break it. It'd be awfully sharp. Someone could really hurt themselves.\"\n\nThe lifeguard pointed him in the direction of a bin. Norman disposed of the glass bottle, smiling with pride at the thought of his good deed. Besides, anyone could have found that letter: a murderer; a stalker; a rapist. Later that day, Norman sat in his recliner, watching the latest season of Grey's Anatomy.

Stamps with cats on them! Stamps with coffee cups! He even marveled at a colorful Kwanzaa stamp; although he did not celebrate the holiday, he appreciated the mastery of the art.\n\n\"What do you think I should get, Norman?\" He asked the disinterested cat. The cat did not acknowledge Norman.\n\n\"I wonder if they have CSI stamps.\" He chuckled to himself. Norman, of course, would never actually *use* such a silly stamp, because it would seem odd to the receiver, but his mind delighted in showing off his interests in a small, impractical way.\n\nAs he scrolled back to the top of the page, intending to type \"CSI\" in the search bar, he noticed something alarming.\n\n*Page 1 of 148*, declared the arrow in the top right corner.\n\n148 pages of stamps? *That must be a mistake*, Norman thought with a hint of awe. *That is entirely too many stamps.*\n\nNorman asked Norman for his opinion once more, but the cat offered nothing more than a tail-flick. \n\nFeeling suddenly overwhelmed, Norman slowly shut his laptop, and decided he would visit the Post Office on Thursday.\n\n", "comments" : [{ "comment" : "&gt; he had typed \"stamps\" instead of postage stamps, leading to some red herrings\n\nBrilliant." }, { "comment" : "Oh, boy.

Feeling encouraged by his ability to respond to such feverish demands in a timely manner, Norman continued his drafting of the email to his supervisor. Norman recalled it was against company policy to communicate via text message during work hours, and decided to forgo his 10:30 coffee break, just in case someone noticed his indiscretion.\n\nEager to inspect his domicile, Norman left work at 5pm sharp.

With it, his water was always cold, and it didn't have that metallic tang that tap water had- it was almost as if his sink was laced with dirty pennies he's dropped in there over the years. It was most likely true. Norman sighed.\n\nOnly drips came from the cooler, and the drips only formed a tiny puddle in his mug. He made a note to look into who this \"Britta\" person was and what she could do to fix his faucet, as well as writing down to purchase another jug when he went to the store. As much as he liked the jugged water, he felt terribly wasteful throwing away a giant plastic jug every week. \n\nOne time he attempted to make use of an old jug, and started to use it to collect coins. He saw on a television show that someone collected enough coins over the span of eight years that they bought a new Civic. Norman tried it, for a little while, but became desperate to find a tip for a pizza man one lazy Saturday. He couldn't reach for the pennies at the bottom, so he shook it over the sink to get access. Now he has pipes full of pennies. Norman sighed once again.\n\nHe savored the few unfiltered(by pennies) drips of water in his cup, before refilling it anew from the sink.\n\nThe sink sputtered and moaned, shooting out the water. Norman let it run for a minute to get cold.\n\nAfter a few minutes, Norman settled for lukewarm and prepared himself to drink the water.\n\nNorman swished the cup, examining the water for blemishes.\n\n*It can't be that bad,* Norman persuaded to himself.\n\nHe put his *[World's Greatest Liar](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/2qlkoq/norman_buys_an_heirloom/)* mug to his lips.\n\nNorman later made a note to pick up three jugs of water from the store, and inquired into finding Britta's phone number.

{ "subreddit" : "lifeofnorman", "title" : "Norman gets in the Christmas spirit", "text" : "Norman sighed heavily, the calendar read Dec. 9, 2016.  \"Well, looks like we should do something about Christmas\" he remarked to his cat.  The cat looked at him and wondered why his human made such odd noises.  \n\nNorman stood indecisively for a few seconds then hustled to his closet, put on his jacket, straightened his tie, tucked his wallet into his pocket and set out, locking his front door behind him.  He strode with purpose towards the nearest strip mall.  Lately, he had become aware of Walmart's reputation and deciding, rather late, to be a bit more politically active decided to eschew shopping there.  He admitted to himself that Family Dollar was probably equally terrible when it came to exploiting workers, but one had to start somewhere.  \n\nHe entered the store and reached for a hand basket.  Then feeling uncharacteristically bold he grabbed a bright red shopping cart instead.  He began his shopping at one side of the store, stashing items in his cart as he went.  Store brand of aleve, cheap shampoo, a new pack of combs.  Finally he was in the aisles that held the holiday decorations.  He wondered about getting an artificial tree, but knew he wanted a real one instead.  He had really not been in the mood for Christmas for the past several years, but he had to get out of his funk!  Sometimes, Norman thought, one has to at least go through the motions.  He chose a green wreath decked out with multi-colored balls, a cinnamon scented candle, a couple of strings of lights, two stockings, one green for himself and one peppermint striped for his cat.   He realized that stockings meant gifts.  Hmmm, thought Norman, what would Cat like?  What would I like?  Swiftly he walked to the pet aisle and grabbed several bags of kitty treats, a box of premium cat food, and a catnip mouse.  Feeling reckless he tossed in a ball with a bell and then put in a new cat dish, too.  Smiling, he walked to the food area.  Candy canes, chocolate kisses, shortbread cookies, all went into the cart.  He also bought two boxes of breakfast cereal, and then getting stern with himself, added a sensible box of old fashioned oatmeal.  \"Boring old oatmeal\" he muttered.  He hated plain oatmeal but knew it was good for him.  He added a bag of dried cranberries and some brown sugar to his cart; if he had to eat it plain it would just languish on his shelf.\n\nUpon arriving home he hid all the cat gifts in the closet.  He hung up one set of lights on his porch, the other around the window inside where he and his cat could enjoy them.  He realized that he was almost happy.  He began to head outside with the wreath so he could hang it on his door but thought better of it.  instead, he hung it on the inside of his door.  If I put it outside he thought, I will hardly ever get to enjoy it.\n\nHe sat down, thinking hard.  Cat came and sat on his lap, purring loudly.  Gently, Norman scratched his cat's ears, the cat closed his eyes in pleasure.  \"Cat\", said Norman, \"tomorrow I am going to go get us a real Christmas tree, and some decorations for it.  You have never seen a Christmas tree but I think you will like it.  I should only buy unbreakable ornaments, so it won't matter if you climb the tree.\"  Norman was quiet for a time, then said to his cat, \"I am also going to get a couple of Christmas cards, I'm going to send one to my ex-wife, and also my son.  I wish I was closer to him.\"  Sadly Norman realized he had no idea what his son would enjoy getting for Christmas, but he had the bright idea to stick a $100 Amazon gift card in the envelope.

He usually listens to Red Hot Chilli Peppers, but he dared to potentially waste his time for the unknown. \n\nHe clicked on the link and a 30 minute long video welcomed him, displaying the head part of a statue. He checked the description and discovered that its a compilation of songs. \n\n*\"Well, I dont have 30 minutes but I will listen to a few\" - he thought.*\n\n\nHe started listening to the music. The title and the picture of the statue was strange enough, but the music surprised him even more: it sounded like elevator music.\n\n\nHe didn't understand why would anybody listen to this kind of music and why it had quite a low quality, but he didn't want to be reluctant to change, so he continouned to listen.\n\n\nMinutes passed and Norman started daydreaming: He was with his dad in an elevator.\n\n*\"Busy man, always busy\" - he mumbled silenty.*\n\nHe could go to work with his dad because it was a Take Your Kid To Work Day.\n\nHe once looked at the tall building from outside and was astonished by how big it is - and now he will see it from inside!\n\n\nEven today he could clearly recall his feeling of excitement looking around in the complex, looking at the telephones, computers.

{ "subreddit" : "lifeofnorman", "title" : "Norman Crosses the Bridge", "text" : "Norman was having an unfortunately poor day. A Monday, no less. That morning he showed up to work with a pile of paperwork waiting to greet him, and Rich Tucker, his boss, was also having an unfortunate day, resulting in a few snaps and jabs at Norman. Norman sighed as he took down the paperwork one page at a time, eager for the lunch break.\n\nDuring the lunch break, Norman explored the possibilities of renting apartments in different cities. Chicago, Dallas, Springfield- all these places could be the answer to Norman's monotonous life. A change of scenery. His cat hated travelling, but perhaps it was necessary for Norman to feel good about where he was in life once again.\n\nAfter work, Norman felt exhausted, but it was the first warm day of the season, and he decided to go for a walk. He wasn't quite sure where he was heading towards- at first, it was to find a Burger King, but Norman passed by a road he's never walked down before. In the distance was a sunset, and to Norman, it almost seemed as if it was speaking to him.\n\nThe road went on and on, until it stopped being a road, and more of a trail. Soon Norman started to realize where he was- a nature trail, leading into a nearby valley. He knew the valley well- the public bus Norman took everyday to work crossed a bridge that hung over the valley. However, in the 10 years that Norman lived in the city, he never once stepped foot in it, until today.\n\nIn the ravine, Norman was enamored by the tall trees; the deer wandering through the woods, and the families having afternoon pic-nics. He bumped into one particular family that reminded him of his own; a man, a woman, and a small boy. It didn't help that the little boy looked just like Junior. As Norman passed by the family, he noticed they were trying to take a group photo.\n\n\"Would you like some help with that?\" Norman offered. They graciously accepted, and as if he were a ghost, Norman took a photo of the family, framing them along the river.\n\nNorman continued his journey through the woods, taking a moment to stand by the mostly dried riverbed. In front of him were a flock of geese, huddling near the pillars of the bridge. A beaver dived into the water and swam into its dam. What Norman found most relaxing of all, was the wind- a long and groaning whistle came from the trees, and like an aftershock, the grass whistled too. The sounds of the city were gone.\n\nAs Norman headed home, he took a walk across the bridge that he was solely used to being driven across. A bench sat in the center, looking out at the river. It was calm, like glass. Norman spat off the edge, waiting one, two, three, four seconds before it splatted below him. For a moment, Norman thought of jumping.\n\n Normally, the reasoning against it was always selfless- if he died, who would look after his cat? What would Junior think? What kind of child might find his body? It would scar the child for life, and it would be his fault.\n\nBut this was different for him. It wasn't the thought of others that stopped Norman from jumping, but it was the moment itself. Norman wasn't afraid of heights, and he knew that the only way he would fall off the bridge is if he jumped. But in this moment, Norman didn't want to jump. He was enjoying himself, he was happy, and everything seemed to be okay. He was having too good of a time to end it all early.\n\nNorman walked home, thinking about his day. The answer isn't that the city is boring, that it would all be fixed with a move to another city. The answer would be the same wherever he was- the little things; helping a family take a photo, skipping rocks on glass, the sound of the wind. He knew it wasn't the view that made him happy today; but his perspective.\n\nNorman went to sleep without watching CSI this day. On his bedside table, Norman put down a flower that he picked earlier on the trail. It smelled good, it reminded him of the adventure he had. He knew it would die eventually.

Occasionally he would hear Frank discuss politics with Robert from sales, and from the amount of times Frank ordered in for lunch, Norman could tell he was a fan of Vietnamese food. Norman also knew that Frank had a wife named Josie, and an eight year old daughter named Amber. Norman felt that this was his one connection to Frank, if the two ever talked. Norman and his ex-wife divorced when Junior was only seven, and because of that, Norman was jealous of Frank. He was happy for him, but still, a part of Norman wished he were more like Frank.\n\nThe change of status quo occurred when Norman received a work-email on a Friday afternoon.\n\n*“Hello everyone,*\n\n*Just a reminder that today is Frank Jenkins's birthday! Please take a moment in your day to wish him Happy Birthday!”*\n\nNorman hesitated. He quickly closed the email, just in case Frank saw it. It would spoil any surprise birthday parties, if anyone had happened to plan one for him. Norman then had to consider his options- say Happy Birthday to his face, and risk stumbling over his words, or write a carefully worded, but less thoughtful, email? \n\n“Hey Norman,” said Frank as he swung his chair around, “it’s my birthday.”\n\n“Oh really? Happy-birday,” Norman slurred unconvincingly. He wished that Frank had said that to him in an email instead. \n\t\n“Since it’s Friday, I’m looking for someone to get drunk with tonight. I don’t normally ask you, but all I know is I’m not getting home until it’s real late. You in?”\n\nNorman scoured his mind for an excuse, but as his head swiveled slowly in deep thought, Frank took it as a nod of agreement.\n\t\n“Great. Let’s start at five.”\n\nNorman began drinking water right away.\n\n***\n[Click here for Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5thcvx/norman_and_frank_go_drinking_norman_frank_part_29/)", "comments" : [{ "comment" : "This looks to be an interesting arc! \n\nAt first I thought it might be what Norman's life would have been if he never got a divorce, as seen through the eyes of Frank, but guess that last line of dialogue from Frank hints that not everything rosy at home.\n\nI'm glad you started a new series Mattress, things have been quiet on the sub the last month or so!

He hadn't seen his son in months--Norman was taking his studies seriously and was well on his way to pursuing his dream.

There were a few other people in the carriage, all of them alone and looking at their phones, reading papers or listening to music. It was peaceful here.\n\nThe first leg of Norman's trip was quiet and beautiful. As soon as the train left the station, Norman's mind drifted off into nothingness, quietly taking in the green fields the train casually rode by.

It was a game he had played in his head ever since he was a kid, though he had never told anyone about the silly imagination.\nThen Norman thought about what he'd say if someone asked where he was going.

In no time, all seats were taken, and some people even had to keep standing. Norman's four-seater was full too, and he had to sit up straight not to touch knees with a rather annoyed looking man opposite him. Next to him there was a woman who had headphones on. Norman could hear the beats of her music.\n\nAs the train left the station, the conductor spoke over the intercom. \"Ladies and gentlemen, as you've noticed we're a little over our usual capacity. This is due to a reroute elsewhere, which made us pick up some more passengers. We apologize for the inconvenience.\"\n\nNorman tried to ignore the crowd and stared outside again, but he simply couldn't enjoy the landscapes anymore. His mind kept going to the man opposite him, wondering if he wasn't bothering him with his knees. He also kept glancing at a women who was standing up, and contemplated whether she was old enough that he should offer her his seat or that she might be offended because he'd think she was too old. He decided not to do it.\n\nThe next 20 minutes weren't much fun. Norman didn't enjoy his trip at all and decided to get out at the next station. When he'd squeezed  himself through the other passengers in the aisle, muttering \"excuse me\"s under his breath and gently elbowing his way around them to the doors, he found the platform deserted. He went to the little kiosk on the station and bought a large coffee to go, and sat down on one of the benches. \n\nHe patiently waited for the next train which would arrive in only 29 minutes.

It had been two whole weeks since his last pay day and as Norman walked up to the teller at his local branch she had to ask Norman to wait while as she unbundled a fresh pack of $20s. Norman admired how neatly the stack looked with their perfectly aligned edges and pristine paper fronts. Norman quickly decided to add an additional $20 to this weeks allowance just so he can walk around with those perfect bills.\n\nHe excitedly handed over his paycheck with a sloppy signature on the rear and asked not-to-eagerly for $40 in cash. As she set two crisp $20 bills on the counter Norman quickly admired them before stuffing them into his wallet. As he left the build and walked to his car his mind raced on what to spend one of the $20 bills on. Content as usual Norman finally decided to splurge and purchase a bag of his favorite candies.\n\nSoon he had pulled up to a nearby gas station and began to peruse the candy selection. After selecting his candy and waiting his turn in line walked up to the cashier. 'Lexi' Her name tag read on her vest. She was deeply engrossed in a conversation with someone on the phone. Norman wondered for a moment who it was. Perhaps she had taken the time to call her father.\n\nNorman set his bag of candy on the counter and without an attempt from either party to make eye contact Lexi quickly scanned his candy as Norman pulled a fresh $20 from his wallet, smiling as he did so. \"2.19.\" Lexi managed to say in between sentences of her conversation on the phone. Norman proudly handed her the $20 and Lexi quickly grabbed it, pressed a few buttons on the register and tucked the bill into its void.\n\nShe tucked the phone between her ear on shoulder as she pulled a few bills out and rattled out some change. She held out a fist full of crumpled dollars and dirty change offering it to Norman. He reached out and grabbed the money and quickly counted how much was there. A paltry $2.81 was sitting in Normans shaking hands. He stared at the pile and looked back to the cashier with words starting to form at the back of his throat. He had just begun to mutter \"excuse m-\" when the nearby door bell clanged as a new customer walked in. Suddenly aware of the line that would soon form behind him he stuffed the money in his pocket and walked out to his car.\n\nIt wasn't until later when he was re-telling the tale to the pile of fluff that was Norman did he also realize he never grabbed his candy off the counter as he left.\n", "comments" : [{ "comment" : "The play on words in the title to a lot of these Norman posts really makes the whole thing so fascinating.

He gently brushed the dust off of some of them and tried lining up the book titles by alphabetical order. Feeling quite productive, he came across his ex-wife’s old copy of Pride and Prejudice. \n\n\nWith trembling hands, he ran his thumb down the spine of the book and blew away the dust. “I’d forgotten about this,” he mumbled to himself.  Norman flipped open the pages to reveal a dried-up rose petal.\n\n\nThirty-something years ago, a fresh-faced Norman shifted his weight from foot to foot outside an apartment door, holding a single rose with his right hand. He took extra care with his hair gel and sported the new shirt he got last weekend. A part of him wondered how someone like him ever landed a date with a girl like Melinda. \n\nThe door opened suddenly, starting the rose out of Norman’s hand. Norman’s throat went dry. He silently cursed himself and muttered an apology before scrambling to pick up the fallen flower. As Norman was scrambling, his foot moved almost against his will, effectively crushing the rose.\n\n\nMelinda laughed good-naturedly. She picked up one petal that was still in good shape and headed back into the room, leaving Norman dazed in his own embarrassment. She pressed the petal between the pages of the book on her living room table, “Now I’ll always have something to remember tonight,” she looked back at Norman. Her eyes concaved upward into crescent moons. The hallway lights reflected in her eyes, making them twinkle a bit, and Norman secretly wished she’d smile like this to him forever.\n\n\nShe always knew what to do.\n\n\nNorman sat and stared at the petal. The memory brought a smile to his face. Which gradually faded as he got increasingly aware of his empty apartment. He balled his hands into fists, anticipating, longing for a sharp pain to attack his chest. Instead, he only felt a dull ache. Disappointed, he carefully tucked the petal back to its original place. After all, it was just a dried-up rose petal from years ago.\n\nNorman left the rest of the bookshelf undisturbed.

It was just so sudden. He lived a good life, he knew that. Not much had happened to Norman over the past decade, since he figured he would save all his energy for his fifties, and wait for time travel to be invented so he could go back and use his time more wisely. But he didn’t have a decade. If the doctor was correct, he only had two weeks.\n\nNorman packed his cat into his travelling cage, a spacious box with a blanket at the bottom and a treat in the back, and prepared for the long drive into the city. Norman tried to think of the last time he saw his son. He had a phone conversation with him a couple months ago, for Father's Day, but that five minute conversation didn’t give Norman too much insight into how his son’s life had been going. Norman was hoping that his son was doing financially well, so that, if needed, Norman the cat wouldn’t be such a burden if he were to move in.\n\nAfter a number of repetitive knocks on the door, it was finally answered by a young unknown woman.\n\n“Can I help you?” she asked Norman. Norman felt uncomfortable with the situation, being a strange man knocking on the door, holding a cat in his arms. He just about turned away solemnly, when Junior spotted him.\n\n“Dad? What are you doing here?” Junior came from the kitchen, holding a little kitten in his arms. Norman felt a pang of relief.\n\n“Oh! I’m just here for a visit, is all. It’s been quite awhile, Junior.”\n\nJunior cautiously invited his father into his apartment, and took a seat in his recliner.\n\n***\n\n“Looks like a new chair,” Norman commented.\n\n“Jess bought it for me.” Junior said, nodding towards the young woman making three cups of coffee.\n\n“What about the kitten?” asked Norman. He wondered if it’s name was Junior. \n\n“Ah, it was Jess’s idea. Her name is Annie.” Junior placed down Annie, letting the little cat scurry its way off the couch. Norman loosened his grip on Norman as well. \n\n“How’s your job?” asked Norman. \n\n“It’s good. I was just promoted to have a cubicle by myself, so that’s a nice change... Look, dad, is there a reason you stopped by? Not that I’m trying to shoo you out or anything..”\n\nNorman hesitated. He didn’t want to burden his son with the news about the tumor. But he didn’t know what else to say. In the corner of the room, a fight broke out between the cats. \n\nAnnie took a swipe at Norman as the larger cat cowered in the corner of the room. Norman sped from the couch, and so did Junior. \n\n“Bad Annie!” shouted Junior to Annie.\n\n“Don’t do that,” muttered Norman to Norman.\n\n“It’s time we put her in her cage.” said Junior. He hoisted Annie in his arms, took her near washing machines, and placed the cat in a moderately sized metal cage. \n\t\n“You shouldn’t put her in a cage like that, it’s uncomfortable.” said Norman. \n\n“She gets too rowdy at night, so we have to for now.”\n\nNorman’s heart started to race. “You still shouldn’t do that.”\n\n“Well, it’s my cat, so I’ll decide how I raise her.”\n\nNorman wanted to say something back, but couldn’t find the courage.\n\n“There’s a hair in my throat. I’m going to get going.” said Norman as he slipped on his shoes, grabbed his cat, and left the apartment. The cat started to purr as Norman went down the stairwell. Norman himself couldn’t stop shivering. *I’ll find you a home, the right home,* Norman thought to himself. *I’ll be sure of it.*\n \n", "comments" : [{ "comment" : "These are great!

Did Norman somehow shut the alarm off without waking up? Did he forget to set it?\n\nWith no time to think, Norman sprang into action, heading to the bathroom without so much as putting on his slippers or robe. He brushed his teeth all too quickly to be as thorough as required, and briefly wondered what he would tell the dentist at his next appointment. Then Norman realized he was just standing in front of the mirror thinking too much panic set in again. He jumped in the shower without waiting for the water to turn warm. The cold water stung his skin, but he powered through the pain, his heart beating rapidly. Knowing that every precious minute he wasted he would be more and more likely to miss the bus, Norman decided against using conditioner but promised himself he would condition twice tomorrow! Norman's heart raced as he toweled off and when he put his shirt on he could tell the small of his back had not been thoroughly dried. Norman's internal voice shrieked in terror when he thought about the time that would be wasted changing to a dry shirt so instead he just threw on a coat to match his pants and headed for the door.\n\nIt was muggy out as Norman stepped onto the sidewalk and turned up the block toward the but stop. In moments Norman felt the summer heat and started sweating. He needed the coat to hide the wet spot on the back of his shirt, but now it was causing uncontrolled sweating and he just knew that the rest of his shirt would be soaked through soon enough. He struggled to get his coat off and saw the beginnings of dark marks around his arm pits. But the he was finally at the bus stop and he sat down to try and get control of his reeling mind.\n\nNorman looked at his watch to see that not only was he not late, he was actually 20 minutes early! He let out a sigh of relief and sat back on the bench, closing his eyes and breathing deep breaths. When he felt calm again, he perked up and looked around. The bus stop was rather empty. Norman had never considered that an earlier bus might help to miss the morning traffic, and made a mental note to try and get up early on Mondays just to have some time to himself on the way to work from now on- what a lucky discovery! The day that started out so ominously was starting to look up.\n\nThe bus came and Norman got on. Seeing that there were only a couple other riders and he could essentially pick whichever seat he wanted sent a thrill through Norman and confirmed to him that getting up early at least once a week was a grand idea. He stopped sweating as he took his seat near the front and the air inside the bus was cool enough that he figured his shirt would be dry by the time he got to work. Yes, things were definitely looking up!\n\nTwenty minutes later Norman got off and walked the block toward work feeling as though he was walking on clouds. When he reached for the door of the office, he was surprised to find that it was locked. Was he *too* early, perhaps? He looked about and then took a seat on the planter in front of the building to wait for someone to open the doors. A few minutes later and Norman spotted Harold, one of the security guards, coming around the corner.\n\n\"Good morning, Norman,\" said Harold amiabily.\n\n\"Good morning, Harold\" replied Norman. \"C-\" \n\nBefore Norman could ask Harold to open the door, he had a horrible realization: the missed alarm clock, the rush to get ready, the empty bus, they all came together to form a ball of nausea in the pit of Norman's stomach.\n\n\"What are you doing here on a Saturday, eh, trying to impress the boss?\" Harold asked with a grin and knowing wink.\n\nNorman mumbled out a response that must have been some sort of agreement with the notion, and Harold opened the door for him. Sitting at his cubicle, Norman stared off at nothing wondering how he could get himself out of this mess. If he left, Harold would know what a fool he was, but he wasn't authorized for overtime so he didn't dare do any work. If used his computer for non work-related reasons, he was sure he would be found out and let go, and he didn't even have a book to keep him company! Norman closed his eye and slowly lowered his head down until his forehead touched the edge of the desk.

To be honest Gladys confused Norman more often than he cared to admit. As they walked out the front door of the apartment complex Gladys stopped to grab a discarded can from the flowerbeds. \"I'd love to have a bench here, Norman. Right about...\" she pointed to a shady spot between two flowering trees \"there. Those magnolias are majestic, don't you think? With a little footpath leading there it would be perfect. I tell you, Norman. Not a place on Earth I'd rather be.\"\n\nAs the branches swayed and the rich smell of the blossoms wafted over Norman he found it hard to disagree. A block up the road Gladys was again staring at a tree. \"These guys make conkers. You ever play conkers, Norman?\" He hadn't, but he wondered if the two of them looked a bit daft standing there. He fidgeted a bit. Why hadn't they driven?

Norman dared not vocalize any disagreement.\n\nThe more they walked, the more Norman learned about the neighborhood. He hadn't really explored the area since he moved into his apartment. It seemed to Norman that Gladys knew more about this stretch of town than anyone. Gladys seemingly knew everyone and waved to people as she told Norman stories. He struggled to keep up as Gladys' finger pointed out landmarks. \"When Arnold and I first moved here that building was a theatre called the Prosperity. Double features were a dime in those days.\" Norman would have never guessed that of the humble laundromat.\n\nThere was a corner market on Saturdays here back then. That house on the right was once owned by two Belgians and made truffles that Gladys described with more colorful language than Norman was used to hearing. When they reached a non-descript parking lot Gladys paused. \"This was once Amal's Dad's bakery. It was so good to see him again. I'm glad Faisal is doing well.\"\n\nBefore Norman had time to comment Gladys was already gone, chatting while beckoning Norman towards a place called the Caffe Valletta. \"Leo! Anna! Merħba!

Norman declined an offer for espresso for fear of staying up too late.\n\nAs they carried on their way Norman thought about what Gladys said. \"Meet my friend\". He was her friend. That meant a lot to Norman. Even if he was a terrible partner against the wizards of Euchre he felt that Gladys would still care about him. Before he knew it they arrived.

The cubicle became a rather quiet place- albeit it had always been a quiet place. Norman missed saying “Morning” and “Evening” to someone, and while Norman tried his best to make a friendship blossom with the secretary, Norman’s greetings were only met with a cold smile. Norman did not confront Frank about the shouting he heard that one night, or the night after that, or the one after that, before Frank left on vacation leave. In Norman’s defense, it was never as aggressive or violent as the first night; it was slow and dithering fighting, one that Norman supposed exhausted itself after some time.\n\nOne night, Norman came home and heard no shouting, no fighting. It was quiet. Norman was relieved that it came to an end on its own without him needing to get involved, but he was left wondering how it came to be. Did Josie leave? Did she take Amber with her? Or did they work it out? Or were they killed and hid in the closet? Were they hid in Norman’s closet? Norman checked his closet,  and learned nothing. He continued to speculate regularly as he rode to work on the public transit, to put in his hours in the small and empty cubicle. The smell of Vietnamese lunches started to dissipate, weeks passed, and Norman’s mind started to become occupied with irrelvant day-to-day problems once again.\n\nNorman walked home from the grocery store one evening, settling on having chicken breasts and rice for dinner. It was his favorite meal- he didn’t know why, it just was- and he was soon daydreaming about if he would rather bread the chicken or have it grilled. Norman waited for the dreadfully slow apartment elevator to arrive. *There are only three floors,* Norman grumbled to himself, as he shifted the plastic shopping bag from one hand to the other, trying to revive his curled fingers from feeling so numb.\n\nThe elevator doors opened to reveal Frank, his head hung down, buried into his phone. He would have walked past Norman completely if Norman hadn’t mumbled hello. \n\n“Hey Norman,” said Frank quietly. “How have you been?” \n\n“Good, good… How’s your vacation? Did you go anywhere?”\n\n“I thought about it. I have family in Maine I was thinking of visiting…”’ Frank stepped out of the elevator, shifting his way towards the front door of the apartment. “But I changed my mind. Just kicked it here for the time being.”\n\n“Well it’s always good to take a break,” said Norman. Frank nodded.\n\n“When will you be back at work?”\n\n“Not sure, Norman. At least another week. I was thinking I might quit.”\n\n“Oh really?” said Norman. “Yeah, maybe.” said Frank. Frank stepped towards the door. “Anyways, I have to run Norman. Good to see you.”\n\nFrank made his way towards the door, leaving behind Norman with an open mouth.\n\n“Frank,” Norman called out, before the door shut completely. Frank stuck his foot out. Norman hesitated for a moment, unsure if he was about to say something rude- if he wanted to say something rude- or if saying something rude was the only option he had.\n\n“Is everything okay, Frank?” Norman started to blush, feeling as if he’d overstepped a boundary.\n\nFrank shrugged. “No,” he said. He then started to laugh it off, passing it as depraved humor. Norman didn’t join in.\n\n“Well if you want… I have some extra chicken breasts for dinner. If you’d like to join me and my cat Norman tonight…”\n\n“Your cat’s name is Norman?” joked Frank. Norman nodded. “I never knew that.. I never thought to ask, I guess.”\n\nThe two of them laughed, and Frank transitioned to hold the door with his hand instead of his foot. “… Sure, Norman. Why not.” Norman nodded to Frank and Frank nodded, back, before Norman nodded one more time and made things uncomfortable. \n\n“See you, Norman.” Frank said. He stepped out the front door, and Norman called for the elevator one more time, with a warm smile on his face. \n\n\n***\n\nWell, that's all, folks.

The worn baseball cap struck Norman’s memory.  “Armstrong, Will.  3502 Northside Drive,” Norman thought.\n\n“Found any work yet Bill?” What was left of Bill’s smile disappeared as he looked down at the skinny 30 something year old.\n \n“I’ve been looking for 5 months now, I’d say,”  This took Norman off guard, making his words take their time on the way out.\n\n“S-sorry to hear that,”  Norman tried to sound disappointed yet hopeful for Bill’s sake.  “What’s kept you busy then?”\n\n“Walking mostly.”  Without another word Norman sold 3502 Northside Drive some stamps, searching hard for anything cheery he remembered from the last encounter he’d had with the smoky fellow. Norman couldn’t think of anything.\n\n“Well have a good one!”\n\n“Uh-huh,”  grunted the old man.  The door tripped the bell on his way out, ringing in the sad, still silence.  Norman hoped that everyone at the office sympathized with his best efforts but, every head was bent down and away, all pretending not to notice.  Regardless, Norman couldn’t shake the thought of Bill out walking aimlessly, feeling unwanted.\n\nAt 3pm, Norman and a few others, including Lisa, stopped for a short break.  Lisa was young. She seemed to be of college-age (although Norman could only guess). Norman himself wasn’t old yet, but he didn’t feel that way around Lisa.  She was new enough to the office to ask daily where to find things.  She stood out in the office most, at least to Norman. Suddenly sitting up in the break room, turning to him as if to ask a question.\n“So Norman what did you for the weekend? See your family with the time off?”  Norman was taken back.\n\t“Yes.” he said, eventually. “We had a great time.”  Norman lied.\n\t“Well what d’you do for fun around here?”\n\t“We… went to a baseball game”  Norman had always wanted to.\n  \t“How fun!”  Norman nodded, rubbing his cheek uncomfortably.  \n\nThe manager, Mike, took notice of Norman.  And like a good host, he always tried to help things go smoothly.  He tempted Norman to smile at a joke about the weather, but Norman didn’t move, thinking of Bill, stuck without work. \n\n Finally the day was nearing it’s end when the bell tolled one final time.   Norman recognized the guest right away.  An elderly woman; “Bridgers, Marilyn 710 West Walnut Street”.  710 West Walnut Street had short gray hair that curled in all directions.  Eyes that were once sharp squinted behind faded glasses on her wrinkled face.  She seemed tired, not from fatigue, but simply worn, like Norman felt.\n\n“How are you today?” Norman inquired.  He recalled a distant memory of 710 West Walnut Street loving to get those letters from her grandkids.  “Heard much from the grandkids lately?”\n\n“I’m sure they’re fine, but they haven’t written in a few years now.”  Norman could hardly speak when he heard this. Regret slowly started to gnaw at him for prying in with such a senseless question.\n\n  “I’ll just take some more stamps, thank you.”\n\n“I’m sorry ma’am.”   Norman pulled out the sheet of flowered paper. “Is that all I can help you with today?”\n\n“Just that would be lovely, thank you.”   She left him feeling cold.  Norman knew that cold, and wondered if she felt it too. Norman didn’t speak again until he got home. \n\n\n“I have to do something for her.”  Norman said to himself.  He paced through the living room, which was darkened by a thick black curtain that spread across the only front window.   “But she’s not going listen to a word I say!  Should I just send her cookies? Flowers?”  Norman asked all this to his friend, Leon, wondering if flowers would even be appropriate.  Norman had never given gifts like these before.  Leon watched intently as Norman set the short table for dinner.  Norman did so inaccurately, arguing aloud with himself while he trickled cheese onto the spaghetti.   “What do I even say to her?  She doesn’t care about me or know me at all,”  thought norman. The cooling spaghetti meant that dinner was over. Leaning back in his chair, Norman looked down. Leon was sleeping curled under the lamplight, the sight of which helped to calm him. Norman thought he shouldn’t worry either, since Leon wasn’t worried, even if Leon was a cat. \n\nThe next day was Tuesday, and Norman was walking as usual to his building. Norman saw Lisa walking across the parking lot.  He also noticed that their paces were the same and would reach the door at the same time. Norman slowed down. \nThrough the day, Norman was particularly distracted.  He managed to avoid Lisa by working through the breaks and looking down and away, trying to look focused on his dull work. Norman fought with himself all this time, deciding if he would reach out to to Mrs. Bridgers that evening.  When finally it was closing time, Norman had settled on writing her a card. He printed out something that could pass for a card on the office printer.  Standing up, he tucked his seat back under the desk.  Norman walked a little too quickly through the halls.  He passed Lisa’s concerned look on his way to the exit.\n\n“Norman?” Her voice rose a little higher than normal. He stopped and looked back over his shoulder, not letting go of the door’s handle. “Where are you rushing off to so quickly?” \n\n“I have to go.”  Norman didn’t wait to find out if Lisa had more to say, as Lisa’s response was lost in the slam of the door.\nNorman couldn’t get Lisa off his mind as he drove.  Having driven this route a countless number of times before, Norman had no trouble finding 710 West Walnut Street amongst the winding streets in the wooded neighborhoods.  Norman parked a few houses before Mrs. Bridger’s.  It gave Norman time. Norman wanted to turn back and go home, but against his own will Norman’s hand descended on the card.  It was gray, with a silver flower on the front that he didn’t know the name of.  He walked meekly up to the single story home.  Norman rang the doorbell.  The buzz summoned a voice from the house. The voice was faint but came quickly.  The door opening revealed an elderly women with hair that curled in all directions.  \n\n“Good evening! How’re you today!”\n\n“I’m fine.” \n\n“Aren’t you my mailman, Mr-”\n\n“Just call me Norman.”  Norman cut in, surprised at how his own confidence.\n\n“Norman! Well how can I help *you* today?”  \n \n“I just came to deliver some mail,”  Norman looked down at the modestly colored card, “from me. I know you haven’t seen any letters from your grandkids a time now.”\n\n“How nice of you to do!  But I wouldn’t count it against them,” She dismissed. “You can hardly blame them, they’re all grown now,”  she sighed.  It wasn’t a sad or even lonely sigh, but one with a hint of a smile.  A lump in Norman's throat started to tug as he stared.\n\n“You don’t, miss them then?”  \n\n“Well of course I miss them,” she laughed “but they have lives of their own now, and I’m glad for them.  And of course they’ll visit when they can.” Norman nodded, feeling a little stupid holding the door for so long. \n“Thank you very much for the card!”  \n\n“Well I’m happy for you and your family,” Norman said.  “I’d better get going, have a good night.”\n\nThe next day was Wednesday, and halfway through he yawned quietly to himself.  This gave him a thought.  Norman peered over her cubicle to look at Lisa. Her hair was curled today.  He stared at his hands pondering this sudden shift, wondering how he felt about the change.\nStanding to \"walk to the water cooler\",  he passed by, confirming that her hair was indeed different.  \nWhen he came back to the front counter with a cup of water, he stopped in front of her's and said, \n\n\"Hey, Lisa.\"  She turned around and said, \n\n\"Oh hey Norman, how're you?\"\n\n\"I'm well, thank you. I noticed your hair looks different today.\" he ventured\nLisa laughed, to Norman’s great alarm.\n\n\"Well actually, my hair is always this way naturally. I hate how curly it is, but I was too lazy to straighten it this morning. So it's normal today!\"\n\n“Oh” He thought for a moment. A part of Norman fought back, but a less vocal but more intimate voice in his head took control this time,  \"I like normal.\"\n\nNorman stepped through the office back to his desk, amazed by his sudden courageousness. He couldn’t wait to tell Leon about the curls when he returned home.\nLooking at herself in the monitor, Lisa smiled. \n\n\n\nedit:\n\nHere are the posts I used to imagine this story.

{ "subreddit" : "lifeofnorman", "title" : "The Fourth of Norman", "text" : "There was a special place in Norman's heart for the Fourth of July. Every year, the office rented space at the city park to hold a picnic. It was quite the celebratory affair. Everyone in the building came out in their best casual clothing, laid out red-white-and-blue blankets and towels out on the grass, ate hotdogs, and played rousing games of volleyball out on the sand courts.\n\nNorman's part in the festivities was simple. He was to bring the potato salad. It was a simple job, but Norman took pride in his work, using an old family recipe which he'd first learned at the tender young age of thirteen. \"The secret,\" his mother had told him, \"is that each new generation adds an ingredient they think will go best with the current taste.\" His mother's sister, being the older of the two, had added a dash of lemon juice. Norman had deliberated for some time before settling on classic Dijon mustard. Norman's mother had taken one bite and declared it was the best potato salad she had ever eaten.\n\nThat Monday, Norman arose at 9 AM and went about his morning routine. Instead of putting on his work slacks and a dress shirt, however, Norman opted to wear jeans and a simple Hawaiian shirt decorated with pictures of tiny palm trees. He briefly debated whether or not he wanted to wear sandals or tennis shoes, then decided to compromise. *Socks and sandals it is,* he mused.\n\nNorman mewed happily as Norman entered the kitchen. \"Happy Fourth of July, Norman!\" Norman greeted his cat. He opened the fridge to check on the already-finished potato salad chilling in the crisper and retrieve some bread and jam for his breakfast. Then he went to the pantry to get a can of tuna to add to Norman's dish. He scooped the tuna out over Norman's regular kibble, and let Norman dig in.\n\nNorman left the house at 10 with the potato salad tucked safely in a patriotic-looking cooler, surrounded with several bags worth of ice. The radio played a big-band rendition of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" halfway through the trip. Norman tapped his fingers on the steering wheel the whole way through the song.\n\nLisa was in charge of the picnic food, as she was nearly every year. Once Norman arrived at the park, she directed him to the pavilion and had him set down the cooler on a picnic table.\n\n\"There it is,\" she said, lifting the Tupperware containers out of the cooler. \"Norman's World Famous Potato Salad!\"\n\nNorman blushed. \"I'm glad you like it.\"\n\n\"Norman, could you do me a huge favor? We don't have enough lemonade, and I need someone to buy some more. Could you do that?\" Norman accepted. It took him three tries, but he finally found a convenience store that wasn't closed and used his company card to buy five more gallons of lemonade. By the time he returned, it was time to eat.\n\nNorman spent the afternoon watching his coworkers play volleyball and fielding comments about the \"superior quality\" of his potato salad. He thanked them for the kind words, but politely declined to give anyone the recipe. Around three, Norman received a text message from his son:\n\n&gt; Hey dad, just wanted to say thanks for emailing me the potato salad recipe. My friends love it. I decided to add some bacon bits to the recipe though, I hope you don't mind. Maybe next year I'll come down and you can make it your way. Happy Fourth.

Norman waved goodbye to Norman, who ignored him. \n\nNorman was taking one of his vacation days today.

Norman decided to make waffles. \n\nNorman fired up the stove and began to cook. As he did, he looked over to see if Norman was still asleep. He was. Norman wondered what Norman was dreaming about, and wondered whether or not he would stop going outside and exploring.

Once the sun came up, the two stayed in bed a few hours longer, laying on their sides and watching the Hawaiian news broadcast. Eventually, after several failed attempts to get out of bed, by both sides, the two decided to head down to the hotel restaurant below.\n\n“Can you order for me?” asked Claire, “I’m just going to head to the lou.”\n\nNorman nodded and perused the menu.

Your darkest coffee. Make that two of all of that.”\n\nThe waiter nodded. It took a moment for Norman to realize his brevity. Usually, even when he just ordered for himself, his uncertainty left him a bumbling mess. His most common meal was *the special*, even though he never knew what the special would be, he knew he could at least say it without coming off like a numbskull. For once, Norman straightened his back as he sat at the table. He grew to regret that choice, as it made him have to yawn and aggressively stretch his back. His loose arm knocked Claire’s purse off the table. \n\nNorman’s reflexes were not fast enough to stop the purse from pouring all over the floor. Quickly, before she returned, Norman shoveled the innards back into the bag.\n\nThen he saw it.\n\nA wedding band; gold, and silver, and well worn. \n\nA moment later, he found a photograph, of a man, and a boy, and Claire.\n\nThe waiter came with the coffee.\n\nThe table next to Norman was celebrating a birthday, of a woman named Esther, turning 24. The man at the register struggled to find his wallet, and made small talk as he searched. An elderly couple bickered about the noise.\n\nClaire came out of the bathroom, looking for Norman, but his chair was empty. He paid the bill before he left, and by the time Claire tried to search for Norman in his hotel room, he was already gone. ", "comments" : [{ "comment" : "Love the story, mate.

Norman wasn’t sure how he could get the game going with just Frank and himself, but perhaps if the bartender was involved-\n\n\n“Norman, do you know what I want for my birthday?”\n\n“Hmm?”\n\nIn quick succession, Frank downed the four shots in front of him. “I want to entirely forget that it’s my birthday.” Frank smiled wildly before ordering another line of shots. \n\n***\n[Click here for Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5tnnpz/franks_wife_norman_frank_part_39/)", "comments" : [{ "comment" : "Woah...I hope this goes alright for Norman." }, { "comment" : "I think in no universe could this go alright for Norman, unless he makes an excuse and leaves.

That day, he could become a lover. Right before his date, Norman had told Norman, his cat, how excited he was to meet this woman he would be taking on a date.\n\nThough he was excited, Norman's hand became clammy. He had been waiting way too long to meet his mystery date. Norman had been sitting in his seat waiting for his lovely guest to come just long enough to become frightened. Norman did not like being frightened. His bald head held a series of unfortunate events that could unfold, he could fart, he could spill his drink... Norman jumped straight up, fixing his posture as his date came into view. He sucked in his belly, breathed out his anxiety-or at least tried to- and looked into the beautiful eyes of his dreamy date.\n\nShe was gorgeous. Stunning. Norman was in a spell, he tried to say hello but nothing came out. \"I-I...I'm\" Norman shyly choked out \"I'm Norman?\". Now embarrassed, Norman put his hands over his eyes and wished that this date would end.\n\nBut in trying to cover his face showing an expression of pain mixed with regret, he knocked over his water from the coffee table. Norman quickly shut off his television. Shaking, Norman reached for his cat, Norman, and told him how stressing \"The Bachelorette\" was; from waiting through those commercials in his seat, to finally meeting his date. Norman smiled through a grimace and told how awful dating was to his cat. How he much preferred to be all by himself. How fun it was, waking to his cat Norman. How good living through the same day, every day, for the rest of his simple, comfortable life was going to be. After all, Norman was a simple man.

He tried to remember the last time he had sex with her, and he wasn’t sure. If he were to guess it would have been New Years 2002. To Norman, sex had become synonymous with his ex-wife; the only woman he had ever been with; the woman who left him for another man. Suffice to say that left him feeling rather disconnected from the world that so many desperately desired to be a part of. \n\nClaire was different. To Norman, it wasn’t the act that stood out. It was the everything after. She slept sparsely, keeping awake to run her fingers along Norman’s stomach, her head resting on his chest.

He liked that it was going numb; it meant that she was as close as she could be.\n\n“Your heart is racing,” Claire whispered. \n\n“Sorry.”\n\n“You don’t need to apologize so much, Norman. You have more confidence than what you liked to believe.”\n\n“Then I’m not sorry.”\n\nNorman felt her smile form on his chest.

He would squeeze her tight, and their middle aged bodies and bones crinkled and cracked so much they couldn’t help but laugh.\n\nNorman breathed in, and breathed out, and so did she, until the sun came up and their stomachs started to growl. \n\nFor once in Norman’s life, Norman forgot that hotel’s had free continental breakfast.

Norm had been ruminating about his Dad since he called about Convocation; maybe the letter would help calm him. He decided to stop trying for a minute and look for work online. While his Mom had already offered him a job at her firm, Norm wanted to see if he could strike out on his own.\n\nThe front door slammed open to the sound of hollering. Steve's back, thought Norm.

He rose again, walked to the door, unslid the doorchain and opened the door. Nobody there. Norman took a step outside and looked around. The street seemed to be deserted. Across the street he noticed the neighbours' car. There were two young boys crouched behind it giggling to themselves. Norman smiled to himself and pretended not to see them. He went back inside and waited behind the door. As he waited, his smile became a chuckle as he rememered playing this game when he was a boy with his friend who lived two doors down. Norman wondered what old Richard was up to these days. He hadn't heard from his old friend since his father took a job in another city and they moved away. Norman hadn't thought about Richard for a long time. He was his best friend. \n\nNorman's nostaligia was interrupted by the sound of approaching footsteps and hushed childish giggling from the other side of the door. The doorbell rang and footsteps scampered away. Norman decided not to open the door straight away. That would spoil the game. Allowing an appropriate amount of time for the boys to resume their hiding place, Norman cleared his smile and opened the door. He stepped outside, still pretending not to see the boys behind the car across the street. He theatrically scratched his head in wonderment. He looked up and down the street, with his hand shiedling his eyes from the summer sun. As he scanned, he could see the boys trying to smother their laughter behind their hands. Norman found this strangly thrilling. He gave a dramatic shrug to himself and turned around, allowing a small smile to creep back to his lips. He could hear the boys laughing out loud as he closed the door behind him.\n\nWaiting behind the door again, Norman rememered how he used to make Norman Jr laugh when he was a young boy by acting the fool. Norman Jr laughed hardest when he did his pirate impression. \"Arr, it be time te be goin' te bed, matey. Ya harr\" he'd say, to Juniors squeals of delight. Norman chuckled to himself and wondered what Norman Jr was doing today. \n\nNorman decided that the next time the door bell rang, he would open the door quickly and shout \"YARRRR!!!\" like a pirate. He hoped it would make them laugh. He would have to make sure it was not too aggressive. He didn't really want to scare the boys. He waited with his hand on the door handle and listened closely, but he couldn't hear anything.\n\nAfter two or three minutes had passed, Norman returned to his chair. He scratched Norman behind the ear and smiled to himself, still lost in nostalgia. He reached for his phone, flipped it open, and with his index finger typed the message \"YA HARR MA8EY!\" and sent it to his son. He watched the message send and closed the phone.\n\nTwo hours later, Norman was watching CSI when his phone beeped. He opened it up and saw that it was a message from his son.

The marathon would end on Sunday with a brand new episode. Giddy with excitement, Norman finished up his work at five o'clock sharp and gathered his things to leave.  On the way out,  Norman encountered Lisa in the parking lot.  \"Hey,  Norman\" she said, \"a few of us from work are going to get drinks tonight. Would you like to come?\"  Remembering the marathon,  Norman apologized and said he already had plans for the weekend. \"Alright,\"  she replied with a smile,  \"why don't you send me a friend request on Facebook and I'll give you some notice next time.\"  Norman agreed, and Lisa went on her way.  Only after Lisa had left did Norman realize that he did not have a Facebook account. He resolved to make one as soon as he had returned home.  \"I am a man if my word,\" he thought. \n\nWhen Norman got home, he greeted Norman and sat down at his computer.  He checked the clock and saw that he had two hours before CSI started.

Once he had finished he sent Lisa  a friend request, as promised, and checked the clock again.  It was 7:30 and CSI started at 8:00. Norman had just enough time to make a microwave dinner and feed Norman before the episode started.  Once his dinner was ready, Norman sat down to watch CSI until 10:00 when he promptly went to bed. \n\nThe next morning Norman awoke at 6:00 and fed Norman, fixing himself a bowl of unflavored oatmeal.  Normand decided that he would check to see if Lisa had accepted his friend request. Norman sat down at his computer and opened Facebook.  When the website loaded, he noticed a small red number on one of the icons and clicked on it.  A message appeared on the screen that said \"Norman Jr. would like to be your friend.\" Norman could hardly contain his excitement and clicked accept. Clicking on Norman Jr.'s name brought Norman to his son's profile where he had pictures of him and his friends at college.  Norman smiled to himself, happy to be a part of his son's life and grateful Norman Jr. would take the time to send the request.  Norman considered posting on Norman Jr's wall but decided that his son seemed much too busy for such frivolities.

The day went well- the best any first week could go when starting a new job. It was his first office job, after finishing an internship at a separate branch, Norman was promoted to an entry level accountant. After Junior had been born, Norman was nervous about how the bills would be paid with his wife on leave. The job was a tick on a list Norman was eager to check.

A small dog ran into a plate glass window. Norman chuckled softly, and Junior, a fourteen month old baby, laughed so hard that he spewed up the chicken back onto the plate.\n\nNorman only managed a jerk forward motion to clean up before his wife took the lead. She took the plate out of Junior’s reach and tossed it into the kitchen sink, clanging violently with the dishes from the day before. She then went over to Junior, pulled his shirt off, and stomped over to the laundry room.\n\n“Need any help?” Norman muttered. No response.\n\nShe disappeared into the laundry room, shutting the door behind her. *What’s she doing in there?* Norman wondered. Norman continued to eat his dinner. Ten minutes later the episode of AFV had finished(the plate glass dog had won the ten grand), and Norman’s wife still hadn’t come out of the laundry room. Norman wondered if she was angry at him, if it was something he said. He didn’t see why that would be- he barely said anything at all this evening. Was it his socks? He did do a lot of walking about today, and perhaps the stench was getting to her.\n\nNorman walked quickly past the shut door and headed for the bedroom, finding a fresh pair of socks and put them on.

The day's continuous, occupying task of filling out spreadsheets put him at ease, temporarily making him forget about how he'd need to re-allocate his household budget to accommodate Norman's growing appetite.\n\nUnfortunately for Norman, his routine was interrupted by a surprise visit from his neighbor in the opposite cubicle: Ricky. Ricky had been going through the labyrinth of cubicles, posting memos on each to convey a message from their project manager, Geoff.

Norman considered calling in sick, but realized that with an increasingly rebellious cat at home, he still needed the break of his employment. Thus, he mustered all the enthusiasm and energy he could, and headed into the small conference room to gather with his co-workers.\n\nTwenty minutes later, Norman, for a second, held a large grin on his face as he walked past the fleet of cubicles towards his own, though he promptly manipulated his cheeks as to display one that was more appropriately reserved. He had done it: he made the three consecutive statements he needed to express that there were, in fact, no anomalies to report in his expense sheets.\n\nFeeling giddy for his accomplishment, Norman decided to treat himself for an after-dinner dessert by purchasing a candy bar from the vending machine adjacent to his desk.

Norman had seen the ad on television three weeks ago, and made a promise to get around to starting the diet. Each week, he put it off for one more week, reasoning with himself, until one day, he put his foot down, and said to the bathroom mirror “this is for Norman. He needs to be cared for as best as I can do. Do it for Norman.” His reflection looked back at him, unconvinced.\n\n\nThe bright colors of the fad diet had called out to him each Thursday, when he did his weekly shopping trip. Norman reasoned that normal people would either shop at the start of the week, or at the start of the weekend, so he would be beating the rush by doing it on Thursday. What Norman failed to account for was that not everyone shared his pathological lust for routine. He'd never find out that Tuesdays are just as busy as Mondays at the supermarket, because he'd never deviate.\n\n\n'A pity', Norman thought to himself as he browsed the scary new diet food for a reason to not go through with his promise, 'that Thursday is shopping day. The others at work have a Thirsty Thursday that I could go to if it wasn't held on Thursdays.' Norman didn't really think it was a pity though.\n\n\nPicking up a surprisingly heavy can, Norman added it to his cart, and sighed. Looking at the tin, he remembered why he was doing this, and whispered “Do it for Norman.” to himself. Norman smiled, and wheeled the trolley to the checkout area. He was almost excited about the diet. He thought about standing on the wheels and riding it, and got a rush of adrenaline from the thought. He was worried that the checkout lady might say something when she picked up the 'new' purchase, but she did not. \n\n\nAt home, he went over the instructions on the tin, and then opened the lid, and put it on a plate, tossing the can into the bin. \n\nIt didn't look very appetizing. \n\nNorman retrieved the discarded tin from the bin in case he forgot a step, but he didn't.

It meant that he would have to place his mat next to a stranger who might have had a friend coming themself, putting them both in an uncomfortable situation where all participants wanted Norman to move, but it would've been exceptionally rude for any, including himself, to bring up the offer. \n\nNo sooner had this worry passed than the instructor, bright eyed and very energetic for only 11:30 in the morning on a Saturday, quickly entered and called the group to come and sit on the floor, positioning themselves in the particular oval which left a few spaces too empty, and a few others too small. Norman wondered if he should try and scoot towards the elderly woman on his right, but decided that it would only alienate the man on the left.\n\nThe instructor began to speak.\n\n\"Welcome everyone to your first yoga class. *Namaste*. Now, I thought it would be a *wonderful* idea to begin this class with a little *icebreaker*!\" She giggled to herself, then continued.\n\"Now, we're gonna play a little game called 'Wacky Words!'

When the toast popped up, Norman considered using the spoon to spread butter on the hot toast. He thought about how the spoon might actually work, with the proper technique. He held the spoon purposefully before himself, and studied the form of the spoon and the musculature of his hand. \n\n\"That hand is still a little shaky,\" Norman muttered. He often talked to himself. It was becoming a bad habit. \"I should quit this muttering nonsense.

A knife is definitely superior.\" \n\nThought experiment having arrived at a plausible conclusion, Norman proceeded with confidence the preparation of his midnight snack. \n\nNorman lifted the toast to eye level, and leaned in to smell its carbon aroma.

A minute later, the front door swung open.\n\n\nIt was Josie- Frank’s wife. Norman had never spoken to her personally. He hadn’t forgotten the promise he made to himself earlier in the evening.\n\t\n“*For Christ’s sake Frank. You’re unbelievable!*” she whispered harshly.\n\n“I do,” started Frank, speaking at full volume, “what I damn well please!”\n\n“Who’s this?” she said, glaring at Norman. \n\n“I’mis cubicle mate, Norman,” Norman slurred. Josie flinched away as Norman stuck his arm out for a handshake.\n\n“How come I never heard of you then, huh?”\n\nNorman shrugged. He didn’t know what to say. He figured that he must’ve come up in conversation at least once, over the decade. *Apparently not.*\n\n“Get in, Frank.” she said, grabbing her husband by the collar. The little frog in Norman’s throat became lodged, as his chance to speak up to Josie was lost. Norman stood in the hallway, regaining his composure. He saw Frank’s little key sitting on top of the welcome mat. \n\n***\n[Click here for Part 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5u28wz/a_regular_work_day_norman_frank_part_59/)\n\n", "comments" : [{ "comment" : "Jeez, that was unpleasant to read, but in a good way." }, { "comment" : "Welp, I guess I'm going to live with that title typo for the rest of my life." }] }

It had been a moment’s decision to buy them because they were not his usual brand but higher valued one on a sale.

Here was where his rusted Euchre skills would be put to the test.\n\nGladys had already set to chattering with folks waiting for their fourth player to arrive, holding a steaming Styrofoam cup and shaking with laughter.

This wasn’t so bad, Norman thought to himself. So far.\n\nBefore too long Norman and Gladys’ opponents arrived.

Hoping to avoid awkward silence, Norman offered to grab his opponents something from the counter.\n\n“Thanks, Norman. I’d like some water”.

Walking from the counter after thanking the acne-riddled teen, Norman thought about his old church and its massive pipe organ. It seemed omnipotent when Norman was a child, a gaping maw of unimaginable power that in theory transported its listeners to holy thoughts. Norman hadn’t gone in years but that deep timbre never stopped ringing in his soul.\n\nAs tricks and hands came and went Norman settled into routine. He had definitely made some bad plays here and there but the gentle teasing from the rest of the table didn’t sting like Norman thought it would. He learned more about his opponents and discovered that Burkes, like Norman’s father, had served in the war before quitting the Army. When Norman mentioned the commonality with his father Burkes asked if Norman’s father had said anything.\n\nHe hadn’t. In fact, Norman remembered his father to the table as a silent, sunken figure.

Before Norman sank into melancholy Gladys piped up about her father, an officer in the Navy who smoked a pipe and told fantastic tales of his time at sea. To have believed him Gladys’ father had fought the Kraken, repelled pirates, saved princes and princesses, delivered royal messages, and done all that before breakfast. They had a good laugh.\n\nAs they folded up their chairs Jonathon asked if Norman would be back next week. “But what about Gladys’ partner?” Norman was worried – he couldn’t supplant that person!\n\n“It’s okay, Norman.

While the page was loading, he pulled out his phone and his wallet, and put them on his desk, in case he needed to get an app or give some debit card information.\n\nHe put in his name, his address, P.O. box, zip code. When it asked for a security question, he chose \"name of pet\" and entered \"Norman\". He smiled at the fact that Norman would be a part of his CineMovie account.\n\nWhen he was finished, he was asked whether he wanted to get the app or print out a temporary card before he could get a plastic one. To be on the safe side, he went for both. He installed the app and signed in on his phone. He then printed out the card, speed-walked to the printer, and speed-walked back. He then cut out the card and put it in his wallet.\n\nAs he logged out of the website and printed his report, it occurred to Norman that he had broken a rule by using the office computer for personal use.

He had boarded the train a few stops previously, and never quite settled. He had been making a lot of fuss with a blank form. He had no pen that Norman could see. He seemed to be hoping that someone would offer him one. \n\nThe conductor arrived and Norman showed him his ticket. The conductor was broad, and he took his time. He swayed with the motion of the train. It made him seem tired, physically tired. \n\n\"I need to show you this,\" the passenger said, once Norman had passed the conductor's scrutiny. \n\nThe conductor took the large sheet of paper that the other man held out, and made a low sound. Norman saw that it was handwritten, and had been stamped and dated. Half a minute passed. \n\n\"I don't do this.\"\n\n\"Excuse me?\" asked the passenger.\n\n\"Your train was cancelled, fine. I put up with you being on this train without a ticket. But here\" - he indicated the last line of the note - \"whatever office gave you this asked me to *treat you nice*. I don't have to do that. You haven't bought a ticket.\"\n\nThe conductor had moved closer, and Norman couldn't see either of their faces now. A few seconds of silence passed as the man across the aisle seemed to struggle to assess the situation, to find the right response. Norman wanted to see, but he was grateful not to be seen, too.\n\n\"Well, I did have a ticket, on the other train. I spoke with the other conductor, right after getting on, I showed him - \"\n\n\"There are two conductors on this train!\" \n\nNorman was aware that he was no longer the only person in the carriage watching. The outburst had changed things, diverted gazes. \n\nHe himself had never been yelled at on a train, Norman thought. Once, coming in to land in Newark, late back to his seat, the flight attendant had used that firm voice that they seem they keep only for when it's needed: \"*Find* your *seat*, sir.\" He had never thought that voice would be used on him. His new hope was never to be in the same situation as the man across from him now. You're more anonymous on a plane, you can make it so no-one can catch your eye, he thought. \n\n\"Well I didn't know that at the time, did I?\" the passenger was saying now. \n\n\"I can't kick you off, but you don't have a ticket and let me tell you: I *don't* have to be nice to you. I don't know why they always write that.\"\n\nThe passenger relaxed. Norman could not. He was imagining being the centre of attention. \n\n\"Sir, I'm supposed to be on the way to Philadelphia. Instead I'm here, because of the cancellation. I've had to change all my plans, and I won't see my girlfriend til Monday. I have a ten page form to fill out to get a refund. I've already had my day ruined once, and you're angry over this note, which I didn't write. The other conductor - \"\n\n\"I DON'T HAVE TO BE NICE TO YOU!\"\n\nThe passenger thought of a short remark, but held it back, and instead only smiled, slightly. \n\nIn the silence, there seemed to be more light, like on a stage. The conductor looked around, saw the faces of his audience, lost his momentum, felt the sway again. He was muttering now, moving away. \n\nThe passenger changed seats, to face the other direction. Norman wondered how long it would be until he lifted his head from the form that he wasn't filling in. \n\nNorman took out his phone. Nothing from Norman Jr. \n\nHe checked his connecting train.

Norman decided to wait for the email to come in, because he didn't want to bother his boss. He sat for a minute before he started growing impatient.

So, he decided to do what he considered the lesser of two evils, and go to his boss's office and ask for work.\n\n   Norman found it quite peculiar that his boss was not there, and for that matter no one else seemed to be in the office. Norman decided to look around to see if he could find anyone who can explain the situation to him.\n\n   After searching through the office, and finding many new wonders that he never saw, he found a custodial manager mopping the floor.\n\n   \"Why is no one here?\"\n\n   \"Norman, don't you know?

This was a hard decision for Norman, because he only uses his car to travel to and from work. However, Norman did not do any work today, so he could not justify the harm his car does to the environment. Norman also knew that his house was too far to walk.

Norman was the first to notice the light and the most immediately interested in it, plotting his path to the warm light on the sill as his tail flicked slowly. Norman, meanwhile, was tucked into his quilt, chest rising and falling with some truly impressive snores. \n\n\"Ooph!\" Norman's flightpath to the windowsill included using Norman to reach the dresser, from there making the last leap. The plan was kiboshed by Norman's exclamation. \"Oh, alright Norman. Let's get you some crunchies.\" Early morning routine kicked in as Norman rose from bed; slippers, glasses, dodging the cat while filling up Norman's food and water bowl, getting coffee ready, and walking to the lobby to grab his newspaper. To that end he made it to the front door, where Norman found a small envelope tucked under his door.\n\nHe opened it:\n\n--\n\nDear Norman,\n\nThank you ever so much for joining me last night at Wembly Hall. You are a valiant partner. That and I always enjoy introducing people. You never know how valuable a chance encounter may be! Speaking of, I am going out to visit an old friend next Friday and I won't be home in time to join you for Euchre.

Sorry about the trouble.\n\nYour Friend,\nGladys\n\nPS: Wiltshire says hello\n\n--\n\nBefore Norman could bring himself to question what \"exciting people\" meant, he felt a tingle of excitement. The morning paper was forgotten as Norman put an album on and settled into his recliner in the library to think. Who could he ask to play with him? In some distant corner of his mind Norman thought of Norman Jr., sitting across from him with a handful of cards as steam rises from a Styrofoam cup. Now that would be exciting.\n\nBack to reality, Norman thought to himself. Maybe the intern would want to come along? The intern, a quiet fellow who had just graduated from a prestigious university in his home country had once mentioned that he felt lonely. Yes, Norman thought to himself. He might appreciate an invitation. But would be know how to play? One way to find out.\n\nIt would be another ninteen minutes before the record finished and Norman, now sipping a weak cup of coffee, realized that he was still without his Sunday paper. Norman took the lift to the lobby and walked to the mail table. As he tucked the paper under his arm Gladys came into the building, fingers covered in dirt.\n\n\"Good morning, Gladys! I got your note - don't worry about a thing. I'll ask the office intern if he wants to play\".

He would start at the crust, and work his way to the tip of the pizza slice.  He was concerned it would make a mess, so he had prepared a few napkins just in case.  Once the pizza was ready, and he had slipped a slice to Norman (because he had forgotten to feed him in all the excitement) he thumped onto the couch and carefully fed the pizza, crust first, into his mouth.  He got some sauce on his fingers from trying to hold the tip up, but that was okay, he had already prepared for that.

Earlier that morning, Norman turned on his phone for the first time in a week, to no surprise that no notifications were left behind. *As if nothing ever happened,* Norman thought. \n\n\nNorman ordered a maple flavored iced cappuccino and a sausage-and-egg muffin from a drive thru, and came to his office early, per usual. \n\n\nA stack of papers from the half week of work he missed waited on his desk, and Norman got to work.\n\nNorman thought about the haggard Hawaiian restaurant where Claire played footsie’s with him. It led to thinking about the hotel, and their night together. Norman squeezed his eyes shut, until the stars appeared. He forced himself to think about what he would be having for dinner. It didn’t matter what it was, so long as it overcame his thoughts. *I’ll be having chicken for dinner,* Norman stated, *with Sprite.* \n\n\nHe loved his wife dearly. Her affair took Norman by surprise, and after all was said and done, he couldn’t help but…\n\n*Stop,* Norman thought. He tried to remember which episodes of CSI were recorded over the week. He focused on his pencil, thinking about why HB2 could be so successful, to the point of pushing HB1 to extinction. One of the scavenger hunt items was a pencil, delivered to a historical-\n\nNorman snapped his pencil. Norman thought about if he were a different sort of man, that perhaps it would have been okay to stay with Claire. The husband would never find out, and perhaps she already had a plan to sleep with a stranger on the vacation, and if Norman didn’t do it, someone else would have. He didn’t want to think of Claire to be that sort of person. Norman could never be that man, not after spending so many years of being the man on the opposite side. He couldn’t wish this life on anyone, even if they would never affect his own life.\n\n\nNorman counted the tabs he had open on his computer, counting down until none were left, and then counting back up, until he surpassed the original number. He counted the change in his pocket, deciding if it was enough for both the parking fare and a bag of chips later tonight. He felt a sharper object in his pocket.\n\n\nNorman pulled a small turtle figurine out of his pocket, with the word *Waikiki* engraved on its belly. *I must have forgotten it from the scavenger hunt,* Norman thought.\n\n\n Back in his apartment is a shoe-box, filled with trinkets and memories, stretching all the way back to when he was a small boy. Good memories, some sad, but all things he’s cherished, and never wanted to forget. A baseball card. A hair-clip, a comb, a rusted coin. A wedding ring, some flattened flowers; drawings from his son.\n\n\nThe turtle would wait on the edge of his desk, near enough so that it would only take a flick or a misplaced glass of water to cause it to fall down into the wastebasket. It was a decision he would have to make someday. \n\n*Someday,* Norman thought. \n\n\nNorman went back to work.\n\n\n***\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bmCmb7TCso\n\nOnly took me a bloody year to finish writing this story.

He checked the clock and saw he still had thirty minutes to spare, and with a fresh shave and the tinge of his periodontal rinse still on his tongue, he decided it best to read to sleep. \n\nHe turned to his night table and beneath his nose plugs and water glass was that lovely old book he just got new with a red cover and an introduction by an author just as good as the one who wrote the book. \n\nHe skipped the foreword, tonight he wanted a story. He began reading, the first chapter a mundane recount of the past events in the character's life. By the second chapter things began to pick up. The main character, a retired astronaut, was being pressured to come back into work to guide some hotshot new astronaut who'd taken his place. \n\nNorman decided to press on through chapter three before setting it down. The junior astronaut meets his predecessor and they get into a ridiculous pissing match over microphysics and lunar modules. The head of the whole operation is trying to force them together to work for the good of the planet. One is ultimately useless without the other. \n\nChapter three ends on a cliffhanger. Norman can't sleep on it, he must read the fourth chapter. As one could probably guess by this point, Norman fell into the spell of a good book.

But to beat their common enemy, the defense secretary, the aliens must team up with the very astronauts they had previously despised. With a climactic scene taking place on the bridge of a nose protruding from an intergalactic Mount Rushmore, Norman flipped the last page and closed the book with finality. It was now 3:00am and he put a saucer of milk out should Norman wake ahead of him. \n\nAs Norman repositioned himself in bed, he appreciated the fact that as an adult he could choose to stay up all night should he find himself in an engaging book, and there was nobody to stop him. It was one of the first times Norman, already halfway through his life, grasped the meaning of the true autonomy of adulthood. \"And they say never buy books at the airport!\" Norman said, switching his light off and digging in his heels, anticipating another good book and another good day, several dreams from now.

When he got to the bathroom he checked his pockets for his TUMS, which helps his stomach aches. He searched and searched but to no avail he'd forgotten them at home!\n\nHe was very uncomfortable but didn't want to have to inconvenience anyone. All of the sudden his co-worker Patrick entered the bathroom. He nervously said \"Good afternoon Patrick\". Patrick gave a side eyed smile and nod and said, \"hey Norman\".

He knew the person next to Patrick had Pepto Bismol, which he's never tried but in times of danger he knew he had to be adventurous. Norman was sweating thinking of how to nicely ask Patrick for his co-worker's Pepto Bismol. Before he could finally open his mouth, Patrick's Co-worker burst into the bathroom with a massive stomach ache and Pepto Bismol in hand. \"OH boy this ones not gunna be good!!\" The co-worker said as he ran to the first stall in sight. \n\nGastric sounds that sounded similar to Norman's favorite sci-fi show \"robot alien\" started to come from the stall. Norman giggled to himself but tried not to be audible. Patrick who was obviously concerned tried to talk to his co-worker through the stall. \"You alright in there Derrick?\" Patrick asked. Norman used this opportunity to sit in the empty stall next to Derrick. \n\nNorman could partially see under his stall. Derrick's feet were pointing outward with pain and strain. But there it was on the floor, Pepto Bismol the solution to his problem. How would he reach it? If he grabbed it Derrick would see and likely be upset.\n\nNorman decided it was time to stop playing around and get serious...but he couldn't grab it. He walked out of the bathroom and headed towards Derrick's  desk with intentions of taking a small sip of his Pepto Bismol. As he got closer he looked over to\nhis desk and noticed his files were untidy. \"Let me fix this before I go over there.\" He felt somewhat confident but needed to prioritize work.

{ "subreddit" : "lifeofnorman", "title" : "A Norman Short Film: Here's the deal, people.", "text" : "So, less than a week ago I said that I might be making a Norman short film for the Rode Reel competition. I said that I would gage the interest of my fellow filmmakers here where I live, to see if they would be want to work together on a project like this. I don't think they know Norman like I do, but the whole established audience thing, the 57,000 of you, makes it an easy sell to outsiders.\n\nI wrote out a few scripts and sent it around, and they all like it- but it's too short. I'll post it here, and you guys can give me some feedback as well on the stories chosen for the script. \n\nAnyways, the too short thing- the Rode Reel contest requires it to be between 1-3 minutes. I wrote a script that fits there, but at the same time, it's wasted potential to make it that short. The other problem comes from the fact that screenwriting is a terribly different monster than just prose. If you write something in, you *have* to figure out how it can be filmed, and filmed for the cheap.\n\nSo here's my proposal so far: I'm going to write a 5-10 minute short, and after the script is locked, I'll do the storyboarding and budget planning.

He crumbled the cookie down to a powder, making sure to fight the urges as he stayed true to a diet he started the week before. As he walked through his apartment hallway, just about to peel open the wrapper and read his fortune, Norman heard shouting. \n\nIt was Frank and Josie. As Norman neared their apartment door, the shouting grew louder, harsher, more explicit, and clear as day.\n\n*“You’re a fucking cunt, Josie! Always were! You gonna try to raise a cunt daughter?! Not on my watch! Don’t you fucking dare!”* \n\n*“You say this shit in front of her, and she’s going to end up fucking miserable like you! You’re a piece of shit!”*\n\nNorman could hear Amber in the room too, a wailing cry. It shook the walls. Norman choked on saliva as he struggled to swallow, his head throbbed in the burst of anxiety, his knees wobbled, and his fist hovered by the door, desperately hoping to gain the momentum and knock.\n\n\n*This is that slap in the face*, Norman thought. The fighting was relentless and it wouldn’t stop unless Norman did something. Norman would just have to knock, that’s all, and perhaps it wouldn’t solve anything, but at least it would stop the fighting. A simple knock on the door. He did it all the time. He wasn’t tired, wasn’t lazy, and he had no physical excuse in the world not to just do it. What if the knock wasn’t heard? What if they were so heavily in the throws of their fight that, no matter how hard he knocked, it wouldn’t be noticed? Norman had no excuse, none but the ones he gave himself, the moments of hesitation forming to something tangible. No one would hold Norman accountable if he didn’t say anything. He could still be at the Chinese restaurant, for all anyone cared. If  someone else came through the hallway, perhaps they could knock together. Anyone at all, *somebody else*. It would be safer that way. It would all end up okay.\n\nNorman unlocked the front door to his apartment. It was quiet, calm inside. A leftover pot of tea from the morning sat on the counter, and his cat slept soundly on the recliner, moving to a stretch as it became aware of Norman coming home. Norman changed into his cozies and turned on television, aimlessly flipping through the channels. He muted the television, and listened carefully. He couldn’t hear anything. He didn’t know if it was always this way, or if the fighting had stopped. He could hear stomping on the ceiling sometimes. The streets below often echoed honking horns through the cracked kitchen window. It wasn’t always this quiet. Things could be worse. \n\nNorman pulled the fortune cookie wrapper from his coat pocket, still filled with the crumbs and fortune inside. Norman pinched open the package and pulled out the paper.\n\n**“Two days from now, tomorrow will be yesterday.”** \n\n*Two days from now will be Friday*, Norman tried to joke with himself. Norman lifted the package upwards and poured the crumbs into his mouth. He didn’t forget about his diet, but he knew that one cookie wouldn’t have made that much of a difference anyways. A single cookie was the least of his worries.\n\n***\n\n[Click here for Part 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5upbzd/normans_chance_norman_frank_part_89/)\n", "comments" : [{ "comment" : "This just keeps worse and worse.

After his morning routine, he decided, he would head over to Mama’s Cafe. He finished getting ready, grabbed his Kangol, wallet, and keys, and headed out the door. It was a short walk to the cafe and he probably managed it twice a week now for at least a year. Opening the door, he was greeted with a smile by Theresa. “How’s the granddaughter, Theresa?” Norman asked with a friendly smile. A confused look passed over Theresa’s face, but then she responded, “Um, she’s fine, thanks.” Despite being a regular, apparently Theresa didn’t recognize Norman and she certainly didn’t seem to remember telling the table next to him about her granddaughter the last time Norman was in. Theresa asked if anyone was to be joining him today and Norman mumbled that it was just him.\n\n\nNorman sat at his table patiently, knowing already what he would like to eat- the usual toast and two eggs with a side of sausage. A few minute passed and Norman smiled amiably about, noting that the restaurant was a little slow, and wondering when a server would be by to take his order. It must have been about 15 minutes before his server, Angela, showed up to ask what he’d like to drink. Norman was a upset by Angela’s tardiness, but Norman always assumed the best of people so he didn’t remark on how long it had taken her to get to him and simply asked for a glass of orange juice and a glass of water. He was about to say that he was ready to order food, as well, but Angela had zipped off to grab his drinks before he could get a word out about it.\n\n\nMany more minutes passed with Norman’s mouth feeling dryer and dryer when Angela finally showed back up with his drinks and asked if was ready to order. Norman mumbled angrily under his breath “I’ve been ready for quite some time” but Angela didn’t seem to catch it. “I’m sorry?” She responded with a half smile, half look of confusion. Norman took a breath to steel himself and asked for his usual. “Oh, right, The Usual. Which is…?” Angela replied. Norman was certain that Angela was the same server that had helped him at least 3-4 times a month for the past several months, but again he let is pass and Norman gave his order while trying not to sound as annoyed as he was. Norman hoped Angela hadn’t noticed his tone of voice. He was constantly concerned that some spit would wind up in his food if he was anything but nice to servers. Angela just jotted down his order and was off again in a heartbeat.\n\n\nNorman sat there, contemplating everything that is wrong with the world. Today’s youth, Norman thought, have no manners. Can’t remember faces because their heads are always down looking at a screen. No one has basic manners anymore. Common courtesy was less and less common with every new generation, etc. etc. Norman was lost in thought about the woes of the world today when his food arrived. He hadn’t noticed a lot of time passing, but his food was luke warm by the time Angela set it on the table, topped off his water, and asked if he needed anything else. Norman just mumbled that he was fine and picked up his knife to spread butter and jam on his toast. Norman thought that the food would have been wonderful if it had arrived on time and hadn’t gotten cold by the time he was just half way through it. That was the last straw. Norman made his mind up to complain to the manager on the way out. Regulars weren’t supposed to have such bad experiences! They should be respected, remembered, and valued!\n\n\nWhen Norman was done with his meal and received his check, he marched toward the cashier at the front, mentally reviewing everything that had upset him. He paid his bill then asked to see a manager. A tired, grumpy looking gentleman came up front. “Yes?” asked the man, with a bit of a bark to his voice.  Norman thought the man was pretty rude for not introducing himself or shaking his hand. “Um, about the food…” Norman began. “Yeah, what about it?” The man barked again, cutting Norman off. Norman took note of the man’s hard stare and after a few moments Norman lost his nerve. “Uh, the food was great.” Norman finally spit out, “And so was the service.” Norman added hastily. He turned and walked quickly away before the man could yell at him. His heart was racing and he was sure he heard the man mumble something about wasting his time right before the door closed. Norman headed back home, breathing hard and realized when he got to his door that he left his keys on the table at the cafe.

Instead of getting his floor mopped the way he had fancied, Norman spent the afternoon cleaning the acid up from the spill, taking care to use neutralizing solvents so as to minimize the damage to the plain laminate flooring. \"Oh well,\" he thought to himself as he finished up. \"At least some of the floor got clean-- even if it was by accident!\" He chuckled to himself and decided the afternoon hadn't been wasted after all.", "comments" : [{ "comment" : "Title should be changed to \"Norman  drops the base\" because cleaning solutions are always basic in nature as opposed to acidic. apart from that very nice " }, { "comment" : "Excellent, I really had some serious internal conflict about that title for that very reason and just couldn't look beyond it.

The hundreds of people rushing in every direction, the loud chatter of conversation fogging up the air, the ungenuine friendly looks that every worker gave him as he browsed. Everything was dreadful.\n\nBut today Norman was at the mall. He needed to buy a gift for his son's birthday, and he wasn't sure what to get him. Norman had looked all day for something that felt right, but nothing seamed to fit. He'd exhausted every option he had, trying very hard to avoid the mall, but he was desperate.\n\nNorman wandered the mass shopping center, keeping care to avoid eye contact with any store clerc or passerby. Eventually Norman stopped at a toy store. He looked at it from a distance, and for a moment fond memories of past birthdays flowed into his head. He remembered his son's first few birthdays where presents were easy. His son had always loved toy cars. Spending the day worrying about an appropriate present was unnessesary then.\n\nThen Norman came back to reality and frowned. His son wouldn't want a silly toy he thought; he was a man now afterall.\n\nNorman searched for a while after that. Finally he decided on a simple white shirt he found in a fashionable clothing store (or what he deemed fashionable). It was plain, but comfortable. Just what a man of his own making needs. The shirt was thirty-nine dollars even. Norman thought this was exceptionally expensive for a simple shirt, but since it was for his son, it was worth it.\n\nLater that day Norman went to wrap his present, but decided agaisnt it as that seemed childish, and he didn't want to embarrass his son. Instead, he put it in a simple cardboard box and prepared it for mailing. He would mail it tomorrow and it should arrive early if nothing went wrong with the post service.\n\nNorman felt good about his gift, then he thought back to the toy store. *No. What a silly thought.

The dream was especially vivid, and Norman remembered reading somewhere that such especially vivid dreams were worth writing down.  He decided to dedicate the following Saturday to the endeavor.\n                          \nUnfortunately, by the time Saturday had rolled around, Norman had forgotten many of the distinct details that made his dream so vivid.  It was all swathes of color, vague notions of scenes in which the characters had forgotten their lines.\n  \nBut he couldn’t just give up.  Norman had dedicated this time to writing his dream down!  Come on, man, *think*!\n\nThe dream… yes, the dream was split into two halves.  The first half was orange, green, blue… a log across a stream, acting as a bridge.  Bright, sunny walls… rock faces, like a canyon.  There was a person there.  No, not a person.  More like, like a thing that *imitated* people.  It took the concept of a person, and mimicked that, but lacked the small details that made people… individuals.  And, and it came in and out of the dream, like a ghost, phasing through dimensions.  When it phased in and out like that, this thing, was it blinking in and out of existence, or going somewhere else in Norman’s mind?\n\nIn the second half of his dream, Norman met… his own cat, Norman!  Only Norman: The Cat was Norman: A Person, and running for mayor.  They bumped into each other in the busy hallway of a ski-lodge, which was lined with metal lockers, each about the size of a shoebox and painted grey.  Norman asked Norman For Mayor what he thought about tax-funded public art.  Norman For Mayor didn’t say anything; instead nodding politely as he contorted his body and stuffed himself into one of the lockers, so that all that stuck out was a foot. \n \nIt was only while writing it all down that Norman realized that someone running for mayor in a busy ski-lodge hallway would probably be in a hurry, and not have time for questions.  \n\nHe left it at that, set the pen down, and sighed.  Why did he do this?  The sound of soft purring crept up from the floor, and Norman looked down to see Norman The Cat rubbing against his leg.  Norman lifted the cat up and, smiling, said, “You’d make a pretty good mayor, if they let you run.”  Norman smiled back.\n", "comments" : [] }

A few minutes later as Norman was washing the dish in the sink, he suddenly felt a burst of joy as he remembered today was the first day of the month! \"I can change my calendar!\" Quite obviously, Norman had to finish cleaning before he could rush off, but he couldn't help but dry the dish wearing a smile on his face.\n\nAs he cleaned, Norman wondered what next month's picture would be in the calendar. As much as he wanted to, he hadn't peaked ahead before it was time. Norman would surely miss March's tiger striped cat, but April deserved a turn. \"Maybe it'll be a fluffy white cat.\" He mused. \"Or a black one\" Norman quite enjoyed guessing. He was so distracted by thoughts of the calendar, that his hands fumbled and he almost dropped the dish he was holding! \"That would've broken for sure!\" Norman exclaimed. \"I must be more careful in the future.\" He scolded himself \"curiosity can kill the cat.\"  \n\nAfter the whole kitchen fiasco, Norman stood in front of the wall where the calendar hung, and said goodbye to March. He excitedly held his breath and flipped the page to April. The picture was of a tiny brown kitten. \"I never would've guessed!\" Norman was absolutely surprised but pleased. He pinned up the page and grabbed a pen. \"Better get a pencil\" Norman realised. Carefully, he wrote in his dentist appointment time for the 10th. He simply couldn't wait to write in it again. \"At least I have the end of the day to look forward to.\" Norman thought \"Then I can draw a big 'X' for the finished day!\" Suddenly, the sun shined through the window, and Norman's day seemed a whole lot brighter.", "comments" : [{ "comment" : "Well done." }] }

Norman reflected on his activities through the day.  He had arrived at work a few minutes early, just enough to avoid the traffic his later colleagues always complained about, but not by enough to avoid driving past a few stopped cars that had apparently collided.  Even now, as he prepared to leave the office, Norman felt a twinge of guilt that he hadn't stopped to help.  *They were standing around and inspecting the damage,* he told himself again, *and it didn't look severe at all.*  He didn't want to be late for work, or worse, contribute to another accident by behaving unpredictably on the road.\n\nHe adjusted his tie, wishing his manager had told him that it would be unnecessary.  He'd had an interview that morning--an unexpectedly-informal \"meet and greet\" with an applicant for a team that Norman worked with somewhat regularly.  This new guy, Jesse, had big shoes to fill, Norman thought; Marie had her documentation process down to a science.  Norman had often asked her for help with his own work on occasion.  He doubted Jesse would be as helpful.  (But, he had to admit, Jesse would be more effective than a vacant position.)\n\nThe rest of Norman's morning had been spent sorting emails.  One of those networking sites had sent him quite a few messages about openings at nearby offices.  He wondered if it was true that he could get a pay increase by switching companies... But his benefits were very good, and last year the company bought him a new, more ergonomic chair.  It was quite comfortable, once he'd broken it in a bit.  He deleted the notifications.\n\nAt lunch, Norman had planned to meet Lisa at the diner across the street, but when he arrived, he found a text from earlier in the day saying that her boyfriend had made last-minute plans, so she couldn't make it.  His usually-social lunch was much quieter and much quicker than usual, so he popped over to the shops for a few minutes.  It was nice, he decided, to stretch his legs a bit during the lunch break.  Perhaps he would join one of those office walking groups.  He was going to pass the pet shop when he remembered that his cat hadn't received a Valentine's present.  That wouldn't do!\n\nNorman didn't want to take too long picking out a toy, but he felt certain Norman was sick and tired of all the same mouse and bird toys over and over.  He was about to give up when he spotted the perfect choice.  He chuckled to himself at his joke, and took his items to the checkout.\n\nThe afternoon was uneventful.  Many of his coworkers left early, leaving Norman and only a few others in the large space.  Norman liked his coworkers, but he enjoyed the solitude as well.  He felt very efficient in the quieter office, and wished that he had just a little more work to do.\n\nDuring his downtime, he checked on the delivery status for the flowers he'd bought.  The online tracker reported that they were delivered to a person at his ex-wife's house.  He smiled, hoping she was the one who had received them.  She had chastised him for buying her flowers the first few times he did it, but either she had decided to enjoy them as he intended, or to ignore them.  He preferred to imagine the former, especially since he started signing them Norman Jr.  He knew Junior didn't have the spending money, but Norman felt like it was a nice gesture that his son would make, given the opportunity.\n\nNow, after writing down a brief account of his daily activities, Norman was finally ready to leave the office.  He removed his tie the moment he got outside, and drove home with it piled in the passenger seat, next to the bag from the pet shop.  He was relieved to see both vehicles from that morning were gone.\n\nWhen he got home, he went inside before remembering his tie and Norman's new toy, and had to run back out to his car for them.  \"Norman!\" he called.  \"I've got a present for you!\"  Norman lifted his head and sniffed, uncertain what his human's excitement was about.\n\nNorman brought the bag over to his cat, and pulled out two items.  \"Now we can end the day together, buddy!\"  He scratched the cat's head, and then put the new collar--a bow-tie collar!--around Norman's neck.  \"I took mine off early, but I won't make you wear this one very long,\" Norman commented with a smile.  \"And here's your drink!\"  He presented a stuffed wine bottle to Norman, who rubbed his cheek on it before allowing his human to place it next to him on the couch.\n\nNorman went to the fridge and got his leftovers ready for dinner, then grabbed a beer and went to sit on the couch with the cat.  He turned on the TV, and looked over at his feline buddy.  Norman was curled up with the wine bottle.  Norman decided that this was a very good day.", "comments" : [] }

His wandering gaze latched upon a drooping bit of saliva navigating its way down Derrik's chin. It was a large droplet, glistening, heavy – did Derrik really not notice it? He must have. *Surely I must say something,* Norman thought, but the very idea of broaching the subject filled him with that familiar sensation of abstract dread.\n\nIt wasn't Norman's stop yet.\n\nNorman lost the thread of the conversation.

Norman felt a pang of guilt, perfectly aware that he was being at least somewhat rude, and put in a half-hearted effort to re-immerse himself in the tidal wave of inconsequential anecdotes flooding out of Derrik's mouth, but kept finding his perceptions drawn instead deeper and deeper into that large and ponderous bead of saliva.\n\nThere were worlds, galaxies spinning inside that bead. It shined, star-filled, with every passing street-light. Norman has identified and named ten constellations, and it still wasn't his stop yet.\n\n*It must fall off of his chin at some point,* Norman thought. He'd look away, but he couldn't – he was, ostensibly, in a conversation. *If the bead would fall off, I'm sure he'd notice, and wipe his face.

The change in tone prompted Norman's attention. It appeared that Derrik convinced himself that Norman was a supporter of some political party or other, a notion Derrik found concretely distasteful. His tone got louder, his gestures more wild, the flow of saliva from his mouth increased. Norman helplessly watched as Derrik worked himself into enough of an upset fervor that he got up and found another seat across the aisle. Time resumed, but inconveniently slowly, delayed by Norman's feelings of guilty anxiety at having been misunderstood and yelled at.\n\nNorman's stop came. Before he left the bus, he cast a last, mildly apologetic look at Derrik. In that moment, the drop of saliva came tumbling down. Derrik noticed, and wiped his face.\n\nAlthough Norman quickly forgot Derrik's name, everything about him, and that they even met at all, the profound sense of relief he felt at that moment would keep him reasonably chipper for most of the rest of the day.", "comments" : [] }

{ "subreddit" : "lifeofnorman", "title" : "Norman's day", "text" : "Norman stared vacantly out of the back of the filthy public transportation bus window. Without meaning to, he had found himself slipping into a state of mind of which he did not often venture into often, for good reason. “What are my greatest accomplishments in life? Norman wondered. “where am I going from here”? He thought of that one time he single hand-idly wiped out all of the flies in the office in the span of an afternoon. Sighing glumly, Norman realized that this was not the kind of accomplishment he was looking for. As the bus neared the stop nearest to Normans single bedroom home, he slowly rose off of the cracked, dusty seat. \nLater that night, Norman lay in bed after a long day of typing up financial council and report forms. Spying a lone stranger walking the sidewalk outside, he thought back to the conversation he had had with Tau-Lu about refilling the ink cartridges in the printer when they ran out. Several co-workers always forgot to refill the printer, and that small hiccup in the smooth, bland day irked Norman. However, he was able to quickly move on from the interruption, and continue in his arduous but important task of typing up reports. Resuming work was a comfort for Norman, something he liked to think about when trying to fall asleep.\n\n\t\nAt precisely 6:35 AM, Norman stepped unto his regular bus route, and walked to the back of the bus, adjusting his broken glasses as he went. Norman had bent the frame of his glasses two months prior, after falling unto the metal floor of the bus. He had never gone to get them repaired, as he did not want to break his schedule unless necessary. Doing so is never comfortable.  Norman sat in the same seat every day, twice a day. Everyone on the bus line knew that the second-most aisle seat to the back was to be used twice a day, every day, by Norman. After a short trip to the corporate office, Norman ascended the elevator swiftly, arriving on time. Norman was greeted by glances, and a few whispered “hello’s” from the HR department as he passes by on the way to his cramped office. Checking the printer machine outside of the door labeled “NORMAN”, he was pleased to note the ink cartridge was nearly full, a welcome surprise. Norman shuffled into the small office, moving the chair back slightly to make room for the door to be opened. Sitting down, Norman pulled up his e-mail account. Already he could see a few spam e-mails addressed to him. Most came from the travel agency a few cities away, of which Norman made the mistake of breaking his normal schedule to go visit. He was less than thrilled with the prospect of travel after seeing all of the smiling hordes of people on the brochures, and left the brightly colored office with haste, to resume his schedule. But one email caught his eye. It was different for the rest. Norman took a small, calculated risk, and opened the email. Inside was a block of text inviting him to a new group therapy session beginning this Tuesday, and continuing once a week. Norman gave it a small amount of thought before deciding that it was not for him, and sending the email to the trash bin, to be deleted every thirty days with all other threads and spam he had no use for.\n\nLoping awkwardly out of the large office building with his worn briefcase, Norman hopped onto the bus. But not his usual line. Today was Tuesday, and after several days of thought, he had decided to attend the therapy session after work. It pained him to set aside his schedule, but with some healthy reasoning, Norman decided that the session could not do any harm. As a plus, he wouldn’t have to be around all of the people in the group for very long before he had to return home to rest before work the next day. Norman ambled to the back of the bus, only to find a large woman wearing a flower print dress and sun hat sitting in his usual seat. Norman slunk unhappily to the other side of the aisle. Already he knew that taking the time out of his schedule for this was a bad idea. 25 minutes later, Norman had arrived at the grand entrance to the “Samson and Koch Center for Mental Well-Being”. The name was too long, in Normans opinion. It was loud and bold, and took up a large amount of the front of the bricks above the doors. Norman sighed deeply as he walked in, noticing already a circle of chairs, 85% filled. Shuffling to the circle, he glanced suspiciously at the people on either side of his chair. They looked fairly innocuous, so Norman took a seat, glad not to be under judgment and scrutiny.\n\nAlready he felt out of place in his formal work attire, as most of the people here seemed to be men in their 20s – 40s who smelled strongly of alcohol and marijuana, and who looked decidedly unpleasant. The other half of the group looked to be made up of single mothers, a few of whom had to bring their small children along out of the need for a babysitter, but no money to pay one. “If all goes well”, thought Norman, “I may be able to leave without having to speak much”. Much later, after the sun had sunk into the horizon, Norman reflected on his life once more. He decided everything was just fine, for now.\n", "comments" : [] }

While sitting in his old sofa recliner petting Norman, he dialed the number to the chair company. He waited anxiously while the phone rang, and was pleased when it was picked up on the fourth ring, and not on the third. Norman had a small distaste for odd numbers.

But there had been a lot of catching up work to be done with the extended holiday weekend the week before. It was Thursday, and 11:59am, and Norman thought he had earned a treat for himself and was going to go on his lunch hour a minute early. He reminded himself to leave a minute later at the end of the day to make up for it.     \n\nNorman went down to the cafeteria, even though he wasn't buying any food from down there. A couple of the tables were quietly occupied, and at one sat Kyle with a couple other people from the marketing department. Kyle was telling a story, and laughing loudly. The laugh was always the same volume and duration, no matter the quality of the joke, Norman thought as he attempted to walk by to a far table in the corner.    \n\n\"NORMAN!\" Kyle bellowed, a smile on his face. Norman slowed in front of their table. \"We NEVER see you down here!\"    \n\nBefore he could answer, Kyle held the bag of potato chips he had been eating from up to Norman, \"Chip?\"    \n\nNorman thought for a moment and throwing caution to the wind decided just one. As he reached in though, he realized there weren't too many chips left, and Kyle was holding the bag in such a way that he couldn't quite get his finger and thumb properly in to grab just one chip. What felt like an eternity passed by as Norman struggled for a grip. He felt the eyes of the marketing folks upon him, even though one was absentmindedly scrolling through his phone. He wasn't sure if Kyle could feel the length of time, but he was attempting to remain calm without seeming like he was blaming Kyle for the grip on the bag. It was Norman's lack of foresight, after all.   \n\nQuickly and suddenly, his finger and thumb settled on two different chips and managed to bring them both to the surface. His panic faded into guilt. He'd only been offered one and was now unsure of what to do, but Kyle was already saying something about letting him know what he thought about the flavors, as there was some sort of contest going on.     \n\nNorman though was lost in thought as he walked away to his table. He now had nowhere to put this second rogue chip, and he certainly wasn't going to eat both at once, not with this mystery flavor going about.

It was in the lobby of the apartment complex, with a long draped curtain separating the front desk clerk and mailboxes from the washing machines and driers. Norman didn’t mind waiting in the designated seating area, as it gave him plenty of time to contemplate what he would rather be doing once he returned to his home. Norman day-dreamed about what sort of day-dreaming he would do back in the comfort of his recliner, a cat in his lap and a tea in hand.\n\nNorman was caught mid-smile as the curtain was pushed open, a small head peeking through, looking square at Norman. Soon the head disappeared back into the fold, and Josie, Frank’s wife, entered the room with a basket of laundry. The little girl followed closely, wary of Norman in the corner.\n\n“Norman, right?” Josie said as she loaded the laundry into a machine. “I didn’t realize you lived in the building too.”\n\n“Yes, I live just a few doors down from you.” Norman said matter of factly, in a certain way that made it hard for Josie to continue a conversation. She nodded, inserting fifty cents into the machine. \n\n“I’m sorry about that night,” Norman started, “I usually don’t drink. It was a special occasion.”\n\n“Not for Frank…” Josie retorted. “I’m sorry too, I suppose. I was just angry at my husband. It was his birthday and Amber here made him a cupcake and… Sometimes I wish he was just more considerate.”\n\nNorman shook his head in agreement. Amber busied herself with the candy dispensers, checking to see if anything had been forgotten.\n\n He thought about the promise he had made to himself that night; to save Frank’s marriage. It seemed so silly in hindsight, and now, speaking to a reasonable and not at all villainous Josie, Norman was even less certain of what he could do. \n\n***\n[Click here for Part 7.](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5uga14/normans_second_chance_norman_frank_part_79/)", "comments" : [{ "comment" : "Oh man, I think this is my favorite one yet." }] }

He enjoyed learning about the inter complexities of the plot and what may be on the horizon for his  favorite TV characters. He continued to listen to the commercials even though he could have easily pressed the 30 seconds button a few times, but since he wasn't a patron he felt he would be cheating the makers of the podcast. He had heard all the ads before, but today there was a new one. \n    \n \"Hey guys I've had the same glasses for years. Partially because I hate shopping and I have no clue what is fashionable. But earlier this week I was introduced to Warby Parker. They sent me 5 pairs of glasses of the trendiest glasses all for under $100 dollars. With a 1 week return policy if I was not satisfied.

He was in a very relatable situation to his favorite podcaster. He liked to imagine they would be good friends. His calm never over zealous voice matched Norman's temperament and their  frugal behaviour seemed to be akin. And of course Norman hated shopping too. Norman thought about how he had the same glasses since he had last went shopping with his ex-wife she really seemed to like them, but no other women had ever complimented them. He went to work and mulled this offer. A week later after Norman had heard and renegotiated this offer multiple times. He gave in to the excitement of this investment. \n\nThe package arrived. He decided for every week day he would wear a different pair of glasses. The first day of work that week his heart was pounding as he entered his office. Luckily no one noticed. The next day again no one seemed to notice or didnt care. He was relieved, but perplexed he had spent his money too frivolously to garner some attention right? The next day his cubical neighbor Stan  mentioned his glasses and even complimented them. Though Norman was flattered those glasses wouldn't do either. That was not the attention he wanted (he only wanted attention from the fairer sex). The fourth day he saw Lisa for the first time this week (just now realising this, he had been so focused on his experiment). She didn't notice his big change; he was losing hope. \n\nThe last day he questioned if he shouldn't even risk trying the last pair, but since he had ordered it. He felt obligated to try all the glasses or else he would be lying, when he returned the glasses. He wouldn't know if the last pair would have satisfied him or not. Norman's moral obligations almost always out weighed his fears. (He would always return a strangers wallet unless they looked like a thug or were scarily large in which he would drop it off at the police station) The last day of the work week. He hoped no one had noticed this last change he was almost home free. How stupid wasting a $100 dollars, when he had a perfectly fine pair all along he thought. At the end of the day in rare occurence he saw Lisa as he was about to enter his car. She was about to enter her's. In all the clamity of the week he didn't even realise he had parked next to her, which he usely avoided so he didn't seem like he was desperate for her attention. \n   \"Hey I Norman. I just wanted to say I like your new glasses.\" Said Lisa bashfully.\n     Norman smiled and thanked her. Then entered his car and proceeded home.

He liked to think that he had an immunity to them by now. Sure, when witnessing a murder his gut would still sink and his palms would still sweat, but it had been years now since he had thrown up.\n\nBut this was different. It marked the very first time he himself had committed murder. Technically manslaughter, but it still counted. And most frightening of all? He found it exhilarating. His heart raced.

{ "subreddit" : "lifeofnorman", "title" : "Norman climbs a tree", "text" : "One balmy evening Norman went for a walk around the block. It was something that he liked to do every so often under the pretense of staying active. As he walked past his neighbors’ houses he liked to peek in to see what they were up to. He never stared outright but instead kept his face forward and let his eyes glance over quickly. Many of them had tall hedges or fences that were impossible to see past but inevitably they would have a gate that was low enough or was slatted enough to see through. He would see people unpacking their shopping, talking with their family as they got home, or most often just undulating light reflecting off the walls as people watched their TV’s. It made him happy to see people enjoying their routines bathed in the golden glow of their homes. It reminded him of how much he enjoyed curling up with Norman for CSI after dinner. \n\nThat last thought made a pang of hunger shoot through his stomach. He was hungry, and it almost was time for CSI too. Norman quickened his pace and quickly got to his front door. All the lights were off. *Oh no! When I left the landlord was home but he must have gone out. How will I get inside?!* He fretted and called out but there was no response. *Maybe he left a window open*, he thought and proceeded to sidle down the narrow passage between his house and the neighbour’s. At the back of the house Norman could see that the landlord had left the upstairs bathroom window open which was conveniently close to a strong branch extending from a tree that Norman had not even contemplated in a long time. *I can’t believe I forgot about this tree. I should come into the back yard more often.* The tree had many branches which looked rather climbable and Norman could see a fairly straightforward path up the tree to the bathroom window. *Am I really considering this?* Norman had not climbed a tree since he was young. He remembered getting stuck up a tree once and after that he had never climbed again. But by now his stomach was eating itself and CSI was due start so it had to be done. Norman, slowly but surely, edged his way up the tree, testing every foothold before trusting his weight to it. *How embarrassing*, he thought as he crawled along the final branch on his belly, *I hope the neighbours don’t see me!* Finally he was at the bathroom window and able to slither through headfirst, landing his hands and then his feet safe on the bathroom floor. He sat there for a few minutes, waiting for the fuzziness in his head to pass, breathing hard.\n\nThe house remained dark as he made his way downstairs on trembling legs to the couch. His hunger was forgotten as the adrenaline continued to twist his belly. It seemed like he was sitting only a minute before he heard the key turn in the latch. *What terrible timing he has*, thought Norman and he turned his head to watch as the light flicked on and Norman stumbled through the door with a large shopping bag in his arms. \n\n“Hello Norman,” he said.\n\n“It’s time for CSI,” said Norman, but Norman didn’t understand and went to put the shopping away.\n\n“I got you some fresh meat,” and he spooned it out into Norman’s bowl before putting the milk away and setting a TV dinner in the microwave.\n\n“Thank you, but I am not feeling well,” said Norman and waited for Norman to sit down. \n\n“Not feeling well, eh buddy?”\n\nFinally, the TV was flicked on and a lap formed as Norman sat down. Norman stretched and climbed onto Norman’s legs, turned around once to curl into a ball and relaxed into his lap.

He had just finished shaving and was reaching for a paper towel. It was then he noticed something important was very much absent in his reflection.  \n\nHe probed his off-color hands over his smoothed cheeks, completely awestruck at the new face staring strangely back at him. Short, black hair; squinted eyes; fat yellow cheeks; all features that were surprising to suddenly appear in Norman’s mirror in the middle of his routine. \"This isn’t my face! But yet…\" it seemed to fit snugly over his body. He probed it freely, moved the muscles easily without discomfort, as if he had practice wearing it before. \"But where,\" he wondered dimly, \"…my face, this isn’t my face. Why am I seeing this?\" He was caught deep in the struggle to derive some reason from this anomaly. His whole mind engulfed itself in the paradox, and he did not realize that he was slowly backing away from the sink. Without knowing he had fallen, Norman woke hours later propped upright in the tub.\n\nHe soon came to with a throbbing headache and a tender sore on the back of his head. He probed the soft spot gently with is fingers, then, looking at his fingers, noticed that they were the same shade of off-white that had conquered his complexion earlier. \n\n\"Oh Jesus. Please, why am I seeing this?\" \"Why does this have to happen now?\" He whimpered loudly, the words rang painfully in his head. He stood himself up only to fall over, leaning on the bathroom door. He clasped his hand to his face, keeping out the light from hurting his head. \"What is happening?\" He whispered, tears trickling between his fingers. \"There’s a reason; this isn’t just happening\" he thought \"There is a reason.\" He wiped his hand on a pant-leg and dimmed the bathroom lights. Standing in line with the mirror, he began taking a focused examination over his new face.\n\nThe probing began with his eyes- studying the color, the number of eyelashes, the pigment beneath the eyelids, the brightness of the blood vessels, and other minute details. He then moved to the nose, ears, mouth, hair, eyebrows, chin, forehead, and whatever was left of the face. Finally, he came to the conclusion which seemed most acceptable to him, in light of his findings.\n\n\"It’s just a dream. It’s just a dream\" He told himself, turning away from the mirror. \"This is nothing more than a dream, or rather a nightmare. Obviously I am still lying unconscious in the tub, and everything that’s happening now is just a product of that concussion. My mind is just confused.\" He took the train further \"Perhaps even, I’m still lying in bed, and all this is just an elaborate way of signaling my brain that I had overslept the alarm.\" But with this invention came the expected epiphany: \"But if I am suddenly aware of all this now, why haven’t I woken up?\"  He left his bathroom and began pacing incessantly in his bedroom, attempting desperately to weave together again his unravelling dream-theory. \"Perhaps another blow,\" he thought, \"will do the trick.\" But he had to grapple with the possibility that he may be awake, and that it was his conscious mind that was ailing him. \"There’s a chance I’m suffering from a nervous breakdown, that this is all part of some freak out. But then, what can I do?\" But this idea didn’t satisfy him, for apart from the obvious symptom, his mind was working quite as it always had. \n\nHe took to TV as his mind roamed farther into bleaker thoughts. But he couldn’t shake the terror bubbling from his gut.

Norman crept down the suburban side street at the school zone mandated 15 miles per hour. He looked left and right for a parking lot, but saw none.

{ "subreddit" : "lifeofnorman", "title" : "Norman Replaces His TV Remote", "text" : "Norman settled down on the couch after the final day of a relaxing long weekend. He'd just played a energetic round of tennis with his neighbor whom he didn't intend to keep in touch with should he ever move away. \n\n\"I better fix dinner before I get comfortable.\" Norman decided, heaving himself up to a standing position. He opened his refrigerator and stood back. \"Nothing to eat in here. It's too full.\" He closed the door and thought a moment. He wondered in his head \"Do I want a whole meal or would a well choreographed snack be sufficient? I guess I did have an early lunch.\" Norman opened his freezer and found two perfectly good options. Half a box of fish sticks or a frozen pizza with pesto and sun-dried tomatoes. He settled on the fish sticks, since they were open. He read the directions and turned the knob to preheat his oven for the specified 325 degrees Fahrenheit. \n\nNorman returned to his favorite spot in the couch, where he'd left a \"comfort\" indentation, to wait for the oven to warm. Just as he was about to sit, it occurred to him, he'd been out of town last weekend. So the fish sticks may be older than he originally expected. He checked the expiration date, and sure enough, they'd turned two days prior. He put his textured slippers on and tossed the box in the outside trash so they wouldn't emanate a fishy odor in thawing in the kitchen trash. He returned and went about putting the pizza in the oven. Fortunately the pizza was also to be cooked at 325 degrees, so no further manipulation of the oven was required. \n\nFinally situated on the couch, he flipped the TV on to channel 12 ice hockey. Or at least, he tried to. The remote wouldn't turn on the television. He tried aiming it at different spots of the TV. He took his cable box out of the cabinet so it was visible to the remote. When that didn't work he finally, begrudgingly, went to the supply drawer at the other end of the room to find a D battery and screwdriver with which to change it. \n\nHe made a note on his pad to buy more D batteries as he returned to the couch. But the battery change was futile. \"I'm sure I still have that warranty card somewhere.\" Norman thought as he gritted his teeth. After searching through old receipts he recovered the manual and purchase agreement which held the warranty code. He located the 1-800 number on his cable box and went through the touch tone menu, then was placed on a brief hold. They played a pleasant mix of muzak and light rock whilst he waited. \n\nWhen an operator came on, he described the issue and the steps he'd taken to troubleshoot it. The operator, who claimed his name was \"Pat\" but was definitely born with a name closer to \"Indrajit\", was mild mannered but efficient. He asked Norman for his zip code, which he provided. He was then placed on another hold to the tune of a pop song which he cared for less than the previous selection. \n\nPat returned a minute later. \"Norman, I am pleased to inform you that EveryTown cable will be able to replace your remote at no extra charge as you are within your warranty expiry date. You can have it shipped to you or you may pick it up at any of our partner stores such as Best Buy or Radio Shack. In the meantime you will find all the regular remote functions are accessible through manual buttons on your cable box. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you, and would like to credit your account $25 to be put towards your next cable bill.\" Norman thanked them for their assistance and arranged to have the new remote shipped to him. He declined expedited shipping as he was going out of town again soon, and wanted to be home to receive the package. \n\nHe hung up the phone and, using a hot pad, removed his pizza from the oven. Transferring it to a plate he sat down to watch his ice hockey game. The pizza was a bit undercooked but Norman had already turned off the oven and decided it was fine as it was.

Usually, he would just have leftovers, but he was going on his third day of chicken and it was starting to be less appetizing with each passing day.  He needed something different, but what?\n\nSlowly he wandered up and down the aisles, looking for anything that might strike his fancy.  Frozen dinner?  A sandwich from the deli?  Nothing was really sticking out.  He took out his kerchief and wiped the sweat from his brow.  It had been very warm lately and he had parked so far away that he built up a sweat on the way into the store.  Hot weather always reminded Norman of his love for BBQ.  \"That's it\" he thought, \"I'll grill up a juicy steak for dinner!\"\n\nNorman hurriedly shuffled to the meat department, eager to peruse the fine selections.  A delicious looking T-Bone caught his eye.  It was his favorite cut, and this one had beautiful marbling.  Alas, a look at the price tag reminded Norman that he was on a tight budget.  Eventually Norman arrived at the end of the display, where the discounted meats were sold.  He found a New York Strip that was 50% off.  Upon closer inspection, the steak was getting close to the end of its shelf life, and what was once a bright red steak was now gray in spots, and had a silvery sheen when held at an angle.  It was still good, and would fit Norman's needs.\n\nUpon arriving at home, Norman cleared the spiderwebs from his trusty charcoal grill (an old Weber he found on Spring Clean Out Day in his old neighborhood).  A quick scrub on the rusty grate with a well-worn steel brush, a fair amount of lighter fluid on the store brand charcoal briquettes, and soon blue smoke poured forth.\n\nWhile the coals were getting hot, Norman prepared his steak.

Resting on top of the tallest hill, its residents saw the long and narrow valley below, and far off in the distance, on the other side of the valley, were tall mountain peaks whose high tips were touched by snow of the purest white. It was a rather large neighborhood, and beautiful, nearing 2000 acres of land with some of the most opulent houses money could buy. Most of them were two stories in height, with complementing colors and intricate details and boasting large and pretty gardens cultivated by masterful gardeners. There were grand exceptions though; one in particular was the house that belonged to Doctor Eugen. To call it a mere house would be a misidentification. Truly it was a mansion that towered four stories tall and was surrounded by a proper field with a hedge maze, olympic sized swimming pool, game court, and garden. A big garden. Every day Doctor Eugen would get in his black Phantom Rolls Royce and drive to work. There was a smooth, dark road with many twists and turns that wound its way through Vista Overlook and this was the road Doctor Eugen would take to exit the neighborhood. On his way out, however, the sight of Doctor Eugen would meet the hideous appearance of a rather out-of-place dwelling on the edge of Vista Overlook. This one house was the only poor exception to the great material prosperity of the other residents of Vista Overlook. The home in consideration was only one story tall and much of it was falling apart. In fact, to a keen observer, the whole plot of land was askew, tilting away from the much nicer homes. Doctor Eugen saw this one bad mark on an otherwise pristine habitation and this filled him with disgust and contempt.\n\nThis was where Norman lived.\n\nAs Doctor Eugen approached the home of Norman in his black Rolls Royce, he saw a lonely man in his dirty bath robes standing before it in the driveway. This man was bald with a wrinkled face, in his early forties, and leaned slightly to his right on account of the arthritis in his left foot. In his right hand he was holding a mug of black coffee and in his left arm he was holding a pretty little white cat. \n\nThis was Norman. Doctor Eugen hated Norman. \n\nNorman and his cat, also called Norman, knew how much Doctor Eugen hated him, yet this did not stop Norman from waving at Doctor Eugen like any good neighbor would do. However, at the sight of this friendly gesture, Doctor Eugen became angry and firmly pressed down on the gas pedal of his black Rolls Royce and its tires lost their grip on the ground and promptly \"burned rubber\". This rather hurt Norman's feelings. He thought: \"Why does he hate me as such? I have always been a good neighbor to him! Since I've been living here, always waving at him or saying 'How do you do?' when he leaves for work. This will not bother me today, oh no. Today is going to be a good day! I can just feel it!\"\n\nAnd on that thought, Norman, with his cat and cup of coffee, went inside his unimpressive abode to finish getting ready for the day's work ahead of him.\n\n-----", "comments" : [] }

Norman, being a good man his entire life, has never committed one sin and has been granted eternal paradise for his holy patience.\n\n\nNorman speaks to Jesus \"Sorry sir where am I\", Jesus responds  \"You are in heaven my child and for your lifelong devotion to remaining pure and good you have been rewarded the gift of eternal pleasure.\"\n\n\nNorman looks at the gates and the large set of marble stairs. He looks at Jesus and the cloud they are both standing on. \"Oh I cant do that, I gotta go to work tomorrow.\". Jesus, confused looks at Norman. \"But, my child... You dont understand, you have passed from this world into the other. You have been liberated and absolved. You are free to do anything and have anything you want forever! Do you not want Elysium?\"\n\n\n\"Sorry but I just want to go to work tomorrow. How do you get down from this thing?\". Jesus is outraged \"I DONT UNDERSTAND. I HAVE OFFERED YOU AN ETERNAL LIFE FREE OF PAIN AND OF SUFFERING. A LIFE OF BEAUTY AND JOY. AND YOU DENY MY GIFTS ONLY TO RETURN HOME TO LIVE  ANOTHER 12 YEARS 4 MONTHS AND 22 DAYS A SLAVE? DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS OF WHAT I AM OFFERING YOU?\"\n\n\n\"No Sir I do. But if Im up here, who will feed Norman, my cat? Who's gonna make Casserole every Wednesday?\"\n\n\nJesus was dumbfounded. He was at a loss for words. Everyone he has ever seen come to heaven was absolutely ecstatic that their faith was rewarded. Jesus thought to himself for a bit and finally faced Norman. \"Alright my son, if paradise for you is going to work, feeding your cat who is also aptly named Norman and making Casserolle on wednesday then who am I to rob you of that. I shall return you to your earthly form. But my offer will still stand when you eventually pass again, assuming you continue this life without sin.\"\n\n\n\"Thank you sir, that is all I want.\" Norman said with a smile. Jesus snaps his fingers and Norman falls back into his body. He wakes up and looks around, sees his cat Norman laying on the floor, his work uniform hung up on his door and his calendar with each Wednesday circled in red ink.\n\n\n\"This is all I want, all.... I .... want.\" Norman falls back to sleep with a grin, ready to wake up at 6 AM tomorrow to get to the plant on time.\n", "comments" : [{ "comment" : "Why can't r/lifeofnorman go back to the way it used to be..." }] }

They invited him to go to a sports bar, but Norman Jr. politely declined because he had a class at 8 AM the next morning. Upon returning to his dorm room, Norman Jr. laid down on his single bed, reluctantly picked up his cellphone and searched for Norman’s name in the contact list. It’s been a while since he last called his father, and he felt like he should. \n\nHowever, Norman Junior did not want to call, because he never knew what to talk about with his father. When he called his mom, his mom would ramble on about her work projects and ask him about the girls at school. He found comfort in her voice. With his father, he often found long, awkward pauses in their conversation.\n\n“Hi, Dad. It’s me, Junior.”\n\n“How’s school?” Norman was happy to hear from his son.\n\n*“How’s school?” It’s always the same question from him.*\n\n“School’s alright. What have you been up to?” \n\n“Well, not much.”\n\nThere it was, the long pause.\n\n“There’s a-” “What do you-”\n\n“You can go first, Dad.”\n\n“There’s a little sandwich shop that opened down the street, I would like to go sometime. Also, Norman keeps falling asleep on the keyboard lately, so that’s new.”\n\nNorman Jr. felt a pang of guilt. Just a simple phone call might have made Norman’s day, yet Norman Jr. has been putting it off for so long. He tried to see his father in his mind’s eye; a stoic, balding man with weary eyes, edges smoothed down by the weathering of life. He thought about the man who lifted him and spun him around when he was five. He thought about the man who dragged him out to shoot hoops when his eyes were stuck to a computer screen at age thirteen. \n\nNorman Jr. thought about telling his father about this one girl, Cindy, from class. Instead he said, “Oh, I forgot to tell you, Dad. I learned to make spaghetti the other day, and my friend Spencer showed me a work-out regime.”\n\nNorman remembered the first time he held Norman Jr. in his arms. He was so tiny, so fragile, and so dependent. He remembered feeling that suddenly, nothing else mattered in the world, and he gained a suit of armor and an Achilles ’ heel all at once. Now, that wide-eyed baby is doing a better job of taking care of himself than Norman was, and Norman felt slightly redundant. He then berated himself silently for finding disappointment in his son’s success.\n\n“If you ever need money or anything, feel free to ask anytime, Junior.”\n\nNorman Jr. did not have any money issues, but he needed to hear that.", "comments" : [{ "comment" : "This was very comforting." }, { "comment" : "Damn, I should like... call my parents, or something.\n" }, { "comment" : "Do it!" }, { "comment" : "This was 26 days ago, I hope you've called your parents a few times since then!" }, { "comment" : "What is a normal amount of time to go between calls to your parents?" }, { "comment" : "/u/beanster Have you called your parents?!" }, { "comment" : "Yes!!

{ "subreddit" : "lifeofnorman", "title" : "Norman's First Day of University", "text" : "With sweat beaded on his 20-year-old brow, Norman hurried into an expansive lecture hall. He knew today would be the biggest day of his life. He clenched his textbook tightly, as he found himself a desk, and he realized just how vast the hall was. \"Is this room going to fill up? That's got to be 250 people!\" Norman thought to himself. There were several empty desks, yet the next girl to walk in sat right beside him.\n\nNorman didn't think much of it. He had a girlfriend already, his high school sweetheart. The girl gave Norman a warm smile which Norman coldly brushed off. This day was too important to try to make friends. He had worked too hard to blow it all now.\n\nA little while later, when the lecture hall had already filled, an elderly professor burst through the door. He walked up to the table at the head of the hall, and opened up his briefcase and removed some papers. He cleared his throat and then spoke.\n\n\"You were all chosen to be here. You are the best and the brightest from across the country, and have worked hard for your entire lives, and I'm proud to tell you all you are in the home stretch. This is the last hurdle before your future, and let me tell you, your future is bright.\"\n\nNorman smiled from ear to ear. He had turned down countless parties in high school, pushed away all of his friends just to study and get to this point. Even his relationship with his girlfriend was failing as he loved her a lot, but he didn't want her to stand in his way.\n\nThe professor started his lecture and Norman was completely enthralled. He hung on his every word and after a nearly 3 hour lecture, Norman couldn't wait for the next class.\n\nHe headed home on the bus, excited to tell his girlfriend about his day. As he walked to the front door of the small house they rented together, she was waiting on the porch. As he approached her he could see she had a strange look on her face.\n\n\"Norman, I've got to tell you something\"\n\nHe could feel his heart beating faster and faster as he followed her into the house. He sat down in his favourite chair, and tossed his textbook on the coffee table as she sat on the couch. Their eyes met and the next few words would change both of their lives completely... However Norman just blanked them out. He didn't hear them, and when his girlfriend burst into tears, he wasn't sure what the problem was.\n\n\"Sorry, what did you say?\" Norman stumbled over his words as he struggled to try to comfort her.\n\n\"Norman... I'm pregnant... Didn't you hear me?\"\n\nNorman let the words settle in. His initial reaction was actually somewhat excited; he had always dreamed of having a child. But as his excitement set in, he began to sink in his seat. The slow realization of all the sacrifices he'd have to make rushed through his head. She struggled to keep a part time job, he would have to be the sole provider, and likely would have to quit school.\n\n\"I don't want you to have to quit school,\" She blurted out, seemingly reading Norman's mind, \"I think we should talk about giving it up.\"\n\n\"No.\" Norman would not have any of that. He made this child, and even if it was a mistake, they'd go through with it. Norman had a very traditional sense to him, and knew what he had to do next.\n\n\"I'll call the university tomorrow and drop out of my classes. My uncle works in an office, I'll see if I can't find some work with him,\" Norman's cool and collected reaction put a smile on his girlfriend's face, \"We should get married I think\".\n\nShe smiled at him and rested her head on his lap. He knew that his life was about change. Norman thought about what his teacher had said about his bright future, and briefly thought this would mess that up. Suddenly, the thought of being a father and husband dawned on him. Norman was content.\n\n20 years later, Norman was sitting in his favourite chair, the same chair he sat in when he found out he was to be a father. He heard a bang over by his bookshelf, and saw Norman dash into another room.\n\nNorman slowly walked up and saw a book had fallen off the shelf. As he approached it, he realized it was the textbook from his first, and only, day of university. Norman read the title outloud.\n\n\"Forensic Science for Beginners,\" He had a huge smile on his face. He placed the book back on the shelf, and walked back to his chair, ignoring any sort of thoughts of what could have been.\n\n*Sequel posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/3vexy0/norman_tell_his_parents_norman_origins_2/)*", "comments" : [{ "comment" : "That's pretty sad Norman could've been living the life of csi.

How are you? I can't hear you, so I'll do all the talking right now. Today is the last update for The Book of Norman. It's the last update, because hopefully, the next post I do about the book will be telling you how you can read it for yourself! So I guess there's some questions here. Obviously, not all of you are even aware there was a book in the works in the first place- if anything, the amount of messages the moderation team and I receive titled, \"hey! Someone should make a book already!\" and then me having to say, \"I already am!\", and them saying, \"Good luck!\", should be an indicator that no one knows what the hell I've been doing.\n\nWhen I first started this project, the subreddit was a mere 5,000 at the time. I had an overwhelming number of supporters- 36 upvotes- and that was enough to think this project was worth pursuing. At the time, I didn't know how big this book would be, or even how much the subreddit would grow in the span of a year. Nearly a whopping 60,000 at the time that I'm writing this. A lot of that has to do with /r/askreddit threads, and thank God for those occasional blessings. Some people think booms dilute the subreddit, change what it is to fit a broader audience, but I don't think that's ever a bad thing. Maybe there's someone out there who, deep in their heart, know that writing Norman stories is there damn meaning to life. That all their mundane adventures finally have an outlet. Those people would never discover the subreddit unless those booms happened. So for that, and all the generations of new Norman readers and writers, I'm glad. Anyways, enough sappy congratulations before any is due, let's get down to it.\n\n\n\n**What the hell is The Book of Norman about?**\n\nThis is definitely something that has to be addressed before the book is released- it's not a conventional book. It's not a 1,000 page epic about Norman and his romance with Lisa(On that note, Lisa will only have a cameo in the book- I'm sorry for those of you looking forward to her, but, well, she didn't exist by the time I stopped collecting stories.), instead, it's a calendar of sorts. \n\n**The book is a day by day telling of Norman's life, over the span of a year.** Each day is a different story, all stories collected from here, the subreddit, although there are a number written specifically for the book that can't be found online.\n\nThe way that I formatted it was to keep a canon for myself- so even though any story can dress Norman differently here on the subreddit, the book has a much more concrete depiction of Norman. In it, Norman is in his late 40's, his son, Norman Jr is all grown up, but doesn't speak with his father, and Norman drives a Daihatsu. All familiar things, but I'm just making it clear that this Norman is a clearer image. There'll of course be contradictory parts of the book- it's really, really hard to remember all the times that Norman uses his phone, times where he goes grocery shopping, and times where he watches different television programs- but there shouldn't be any glaring inconsistencies, I assure you.\n\nWhat I kept in mind was to balance the emotions that Norman stories usually carry- yes, there will be stories where Norman is goofy and anti-social, there'll be times where he's too afraid of answering the phone, and there'll also be several stories of Norman's romantic failures. There's also times where Norman's depression, is a factor. Those stories hit in bouts, sometimes a full week of Norman feeling blue. I like those times- those are the ones where I want to keep reading on. \n\nA thing I want to stress about the book before it comes out is that it's not a conventional book. You've probably never read a book quite like this before- not in the sense that it's phenomenon of sorts, well maybe it will be, but just in the sense that it's formatted very differently. There isn't a first, second and third act- there isn't a massive overarching story that'll be resolved by the end. It's more about an experience, a lasting memory of Norman's life. So yes, it may be boring to some people. But it is what it is, and Norman's life is what you would expect it would be.\n\n**How you can buy it, and where the money goes**\n\nThe book, for now, will only be available for e-book purchase. Unfortunately, publishing a physical novel is a lot of hard work- and not all my decision. I would have to find a publisher who would accept the book, and strike a deal with them. And if any of you are interested in publishing a book and have done your homework, you would know that the feat is easier said than done. So for now, an e-book is all the book will be, unless it happens to find success and the attention of a publisher, I doubt it will be much more than that.\n\nI'll be sure to get it on as many devices as possible- Amazon Kindle definitely, Kobo e-reader as well, and any other e-reader that you guys can suggest now. The book will be priced at **7 dollars**. It's not a lot, and without page breaks, the book is around 200 pages; 75,000 words. It's not a large price, but the thing that should certainly be kept in mind is that **100% of the profits of the book will be donated to charity.** This is a promise I've made to everyone a long time ago, and something I've been up front with from the beginning. I'll be crediting my name as the publisher/creator of the book, and I'll be collecting the money. That's something I'm working on right now- I'm trying to find a way to make it very transparent for all of you, to show how much the book has made. I've opened up a second account with my bank today, and none of it will get muddled with my own accounts. I'll be sure to put my own ass on the line here- my name will be publicly available, so if I do end up scamming you guys out of your money, I'll be sure to give you plenty of ways to kill me; that's all just for assurance to know that I'm not giving you guys the short end of the stick. \n\n\nEDIT: All this ebook stuff is a lie! In the time since I wrote this, I've been convinced, haggled, and persuaded to make it a physical copy. So, I can't promise it will be 7 dollars anymore. However, if the book does well, I will make the ebook and release it for 7 dollars. \n\n**The Charity**\n\nI've had an idea for quite a long time for where the money should go- I always just said charity, but that's such a vague description. My college fund could be charity. But, I've always felt that the money should go towards something very... Norman. So what's more Norman than cats?\n\nhttp://catscradleanimalrescue.com/\n\nFor now, I've decided on the animal shelter called Cats Cradle, located in Victoria, British Colombia, Canada. The reason I chose it is because:\n\n1. It's in Canada, I'm from Canada, meaning I could go and visit it if I needed to,\n\n2. It's a cat shelter. I feel like, if there's any way to help people with Norman's stories, it's that Norman's silver lining in life is his cat, Norman. I thought it's a nice gesture to help out cats find their own Norman too. \n\n3. Cats Cradle is a shelter that focuses on, from their page:\n\n \"Cat’s Cradle Animal Rescue was founded to rescue, rehabilitate, spay/neuter, and re-home distressed, abandoned, or neglected cats and dogs considered un-adoptable by reason of health, age, appearance, or temperament.\"\n\nI think that the idea of cats that are, based on appearance, unlovable, but still have heart, is what made me choose this charity. Norman looks unlovable, sure, but it's what's inside that counts. Finding these cats homes is the best fit for the subreddit's mantra.\n\n   . 4. They're an independent charity, as well as 100% non-profit as well. I'm sure there's bigger charities to help, but at the same time, don't you want to know your money is making an apparent difference? I'm sure the few thousand we could raise wouldn't bat the eyes of UNICEF, but certainly mean the world to a smaller charity. \n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAnyways everyone, that's it for now. The book should be ready for release sometime in January- although I still have a lot of work to do before then.\n\nI'd just like to say thanks to everyone for their support to me, support to the book, and support for the subreddit. I'll say the sappy cliche thing- this place couldn't be what it is without all of you. This book is a collective effort of hundreds of people, and it's all in the name of something so peculiar- a little man named Norman. But in the end, this fictional character will have an actual, physical impact on the world, aside from just our imaginations. I think Norman would be happy with what he has become; from a grumpy man writing a review on a Mac, to an icon of boredom, loneliness, and the always powerful idea that is positivity and looking on the bright side of life is all that matters.\n\nI look forward to my next update- the release of the book. Hopefully, even if you don't want to read the book, that you can make a donation to the shelter anyways. Every little bit helps.

Personally I'd like a copy for my coffee table. \n\nAll that being said, thanks for your work compiling the story. I'm looking forward to reading it because I really do think it will be something unique. \n\nAn idea that gets trumpeted around a lot on this sub is that Norman stories are important because Norman is just an amplified version of all of our collective quirks, qualms, and love of the familiar. It seems weird to a lot of people that so many of us derive so much joy from the day to day monotony of a fictional character, but that fictional character is something we created. And in a lot of ways, he's like a mirror. Maybe I'm too weirdly invested in this, but to me that's something special. \n\n\"There’s a lot of beauty in ordinary things.

{ "subreddit" : "lifeofnorman", "title" : "Norman games the system", "text" : "A few days ago, Norman went to his fridge to pour a glass of milk. The carton was light. He thought, \"the milk is almost gone.\" He emptied the carton into a glass, but the glass was half empty. \"Gee,\" he thought, \"I should go grocery shopping.\" Before disposing of the carton, he saw a coupon adhered to the side: 50 cents off. He peeled it off.\n\nNorman wondered if anything else he needed had a coupon. It had been some time since he last grappled with a coupon. Today, for some odd reason, he felt things would be different. With a dulled No.2 pencil in hand and the milk coupon in his pocket, Norman started a list. He opened up the weekly mailer to browse for coupons on his favorite items. Cat food? *No, no deals on cat food.* Bread? *No, no deals on bread.* There was a deal on flavored potato chips. *No, thank you.*\n\nHe found a store coupon: Milk, 50 cents off. Norman pondered, \"can I use both at the same time?\" Although the thought was thrilling, he decided to try it. He finished the list and went to the store.\n\nNorman entered the grocery store with butterflies in his stomach. Everything in his body was telling him to forget it. *Just buy the milk! Don't make waves!* But he pressed on.\n\nNorman found the brand of milk, right where it always was. However, to his surprise, it was *on sale:* 50 cents off. His butterflies turned into bees. He was whelmed with the emotions of uncertainty. \"I couldn't possibly ask the check-out clerk to sell me milk that is on sale for 50 cents off AND ask for another 50 cents off with the manufacturer's coupon AND ask for them to honor the store's coupon. It feels flat out rude\" \n\nNorman pushed on. He finished shopping and went to the check out. He placed the coupons on the belt at the end of his groceries. The check-out clerk rang up the milk. The screen showed: \"Milk....$3.00 &gt;&gt; sale ($0.50) &gt;&gt; $2.50.\"  Then, at the end, the clerk rang in the coupons. Beep. The screen showed \"Mfr Coupon ...

Despite his late evening, his circadian rhythm wouldn't allow him to sleep past his normally scheduled wakeup time.  Norman, who was curled up my his side, readjusted and nuzzled closer to Norman.  Norman now felt somewhat bad about getting up, as he knew from his gentle purring that Norman was quite comfortable right where he was.  He groggily pondered his predicament. \n\n\"I really shouldn't sleep in,\" he thought. \"I wouldn't want to risk altering my weekday routine.\"  He carefully pulled himself out of bed and began his morning. \n\nNew Year's Day was somewhat of a daunting holiday for Norman.  As a man who wasn't known to heavily celebrate the occasion, he found that having another weekday off from work so soon after Christmas was a disruption.  He felt especially uneasy this year, as he now had a day off just before the weekend.  He began to grow a little anxious about the idea as he poured his Egg Beaters into the hot pan, just as Norman lazily strolled into the kitchen to await his own breakfast. \n\n\"Oh dear, Norman.

It even smelled like Christmas. “Once in a while, you have to try something new. There’s nothing wrong about it,” Norman thought, as he boldly grabbed the other box of tea, too. \nBack in the office Norman tried his new tea. It was magic.

It's great that the subreddit is getting attention once again; things get a bit slow every now and then and this surge definitely breathes a breath of fresh air into the subreddit.

If you don't like a story, let them know with some criticism and not with bullying.\n\n* **Norman isn't just about making fun of a small man.** Something that always happens with surges is a change in how stories are written. When there's a flow of thousands of stories, the idea of what a Norman story is changes. It goes from sad, depressing, a hit to the gut in a way that only makes Norman relatable. [For example, this story from a few days from before the surge](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/3p03p8/norman_moves_into_his_new_apartment/), to more stuff [like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/3phv44/norman_says_hello_again/). It's just the trend when you have thousands of new posts, but always remember- in a funny way- Norman is a person. There's a lot of people who relate and care about Norman, so don't make stories with the sole regard to put him down. **Norman is a character- not a caricature.**\n\n* **Keep trying!**- You won't always get the true heart of Norman when you write your first story. Sometimes to takes a few tries, and that's okay. Hell, my first stories (I joined the subreddit when it was a wee lad of 4,000) were downvoted because they were so... *Not Norman*. So don't feel too bad about having your first story unsuccessful. It's all about perseverance and trying again. \n\nAnyways, enjoy everyone!

He walked from his cubicle to the lunch room down the hall, and was delighted to see it occupied by only a handful of fellow employees, one of whom was his friend Lisa.  He retrieved his pre-pack salad from the fridge and sat down opposite her.  Many of his co-workers used the hump day as an excuse to binge on fast food, but Norman had his cholesterol to think about.  And at only $1.99 from the grocery store, the salad was quite a steal.\n\nNorman peeled back the plastic cover of his salad bowl and fidgeted with the little bag of croutons as he eagerly began a conversation about the weekend's weather forecast.  In his excitement, he forgot to pick the olives off of the salad as he always had.  Norman realized his oversight only too late as he bit into one of the black morsels mid-conversation.  The salty flavor came as quite a shock, but Norman dared not spit it out in front of Lisa, for fear of being rude.  Norman chewed away at his mouthful, determined to see it through, and to his great surprise, he rather enjoyed it!  Norman was astonished.  He had always thought he didn't like olives, but in the moment could not remember why.  He smiled with the joy of discovery and finished his lunch, olives and all.\n\nThe next day, Norman found himself once again in the lunchroom at his usual hour, and sat with the same salad he had enjoyed the day before.  He was dining by himself this time, but he was excited to indulge in his new found appreciation of olives.  He stabbed one with his fork and chewed it.  It...wasn't the same somehow.  Norman swallowed and stared down at his meal for a moment, contemplating the flavor on his tongue.  It tasted different than he had remembered, not nearly as enjoyable.  After brief consideration, Norman picked the other two olives off the top of his salad and placed them on a napkin.\n\n\"I guess I'll just go back to picking them off from now on,\" Norman decided, and finished his meal contently.", "comments" : [{ "comment" : "I'm not sure if this is implying that Norman's life seems better when Lisa is around, but if it is bravo on the subtlety." }, { "comment" : "Yup, you got it!

You should be able to read this one on it's own, but it definitely benefits from reading the other story.*\n\nNorman was always closer to his father. He had a very relaxed, friendly personality (not unlike Norman himself) that he found both welcoming and reassuring. Norman didn't dislike his mother by any means, she was a small lady who was often assertive, he just always gravitated to his father. \n\nAs Norman drove up in his used station waggon he bought with his tuition refund, he went over what he needed to say. It had been nearly 6 months since he found out about the pregnancy. He thought perhaps he waited too long to tell his parents and was nervous about their reaction, specifically his mother's. He had wished his girlfriend, now fiancé, joined him but she wasn't feeling to well.\n\nNorman slowly walked down the familiar pathway through the yard. He climbed the steep stairs, and let himself in. His parents were watching the news, and both stood up when Norman entered for a hug. He hugged them both, and told them to sit back down.\n\nNorman began the story about the pregnancy, having to quit school, the decision to get married. His parents always let Norman finish talking before saying anything. They stared at Norman somewhat blankly. Norman finished the story by placing an invitation to his wedding on their coffee table.\n\n\"Norman, we love you no matter what,\" His mother spoke first.\n\nNorman's father sat back a little in his seat, and scratched his beard, as he always did before he said something important.\n\n\"We do love you, Norman, but we can't support this,\" Norman's mother almost looked as shocked as Norman himself, \"I can't support a child out of wedlock and I can't support you giving up school.\"\n\nNorman stared blankly at his father. He never talked back to his parents, not even as a child.\n\n\"Well, Pop, it is extremely important to me to get married before the child is born,\" Norman began as respectful as he could, \"and maybe after the birth I can go back-\"\n\n\"We will not support this child and we will not support you in this.\" Norman's father spoke in a stern tone that Norman had never heard before. This was extremely unlike Norman's father, but like Norman himself, he had a very traditional sense.\n\nNorman looked to his mother for support. Surely she would stand up for him, be his saviour. She looked like she disagreed with Norman's father but never said a word against him. She placed her hands on her husband's hands, and supported his decision.\n\nNorman didn't understand but would have to respect his parents decision. He walked towards the door, and when he exited he heard it lock behind him, something which had never happened in any previous visit. He knew what this meant, and defeated, he returned to his car.\n\nAbout a month later, Norman was sitting comfortably in his favourite chair, sorting through mail. He received a return RSVP to his wedding, and began opening it. Instantly, he recognized it was from his parents. They had checked off the box \"Respectfully Decline\".\n\nIt didn't matter much, as the wedding would have to be postponed, as Norman's fiancé went into labour the morning of the wedding. It was a little bit early, but the baby was delivered successfully. It was a boy.\n\nAs Norman held his son in his arms for the first time, he was overcome with emotion. It was a truly beautiful thing that he helped create.

{ "subreddit" : "lifeofnorman", "title" : "The origin of Norman", "text" : "Despite no alarm, Norman awoke at 7:30am Saturday morning with a sense of urgency. \"I'm gonna do it\" he said to himself. \n\nThe night before, Norman drank two whole cans of root beer. Norman usually drank one at most, but last night he realized how lonely he was, so tried \"to drink the pain away,\" as they say. Norman knew that he needed a companion.\n\nAs soon as he woke up he used his laptop and searched for the local Humane Society, finding out it opened at 9am. He knew that he had time to spare so got into his robe, made coffee, and made some toast. He topped the toast with butter and sipped his coffee while doing the newspaper's crossword puzzle, a CSI episode played in the background. \n\nFinally, at 9:25am, Norman drove to the Humane Society. It was a 15 minute drive, but he timed it out perfectly. Norman didn't want to arrive early, but also not too late.\n\n\"Hello,\" said the receptionist, \"How may I help you?\"\n\n\"Hello,\" said Norman, \"I was wanting to adopt a cat today.\" Norman specifically said \"cat\" because although kittens were adorable, Norman knew he didn't want any accidents in the house.\n\nThe receptionist smiled, \"So you're interested in a full grown cat? Not a kitten?\"\n\n\"Yes ma'am,\" Norman replied.\n\n\"How delightful, most people come in here wanting a kitten, and I always feel so bad for the adult cats here.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Norman replied, not quite sure how to answer.\n\n\"Right this way,\" she said, smiling, leading him down a hallway. \"This is our cat room.\"\n\nNorman entered the room, unsure what to do next. The receptionist closed the door behind and left him inside. He walked around the room, careful not to trip over some of the cats nuzzling in-between his legs.\n\n'How ever should I choose one?' Norman thought to himself. \n\nHe sat down in a worn out, and clawed armchair, pondering his decision. As he sat down, it spooked a gray cat which had been napping behind the armchair. It jumped out, licked its paws, then looked directly at Norman. \n\n\"I'm sorry little guy, I didn't mean to spook you,\" Norman said, while reaching out his hand. The gray cat nuzzled against it, purring. Norman scooped it up and knew this was the one. He would name it Ash, to match his or her fur. It was the perfect name, because it really was quite clever. If it was a boy, then it'd be short for Ashton, if a girl, short for Ashley. \n\nNorman walked back to the receptionist, carrying Ash.\n\n\"I would like to purchase this one please.\"\n\n\"Aww, how adorable,\" the receptionist said, \"He's been in here for a while, I'm so glad he'll have a happy home to go to.\"\n\n'Ah, so it's a boy,' Norman thought to himself, while scratching Ash's chin.\n\n\"What's it's name?\" asked the receptionist, filling out the paperwork.\n\nNorman wasn't paying attention, he was too distracted scratching Ash's chin and enjoying his purring. He thought the receptionist asked \"What's *your* name.\"\n\n\"Norman,\" replied Norman, continuing to scratch Ash's chin.\n\n\"Aww, what a perfect name for him,\" the receptionist said.\n\nNorman realized his mistake, but it was too late.

A few days ago, at work, Norman had gotten lost on the way to the bathroom and ended up in Lisa’s office. When he got there, he heard Lisa talking with some of her co-workers, including Rick.\n\n“Hey, Norman,” she said. “I’m having a Christmas party. I don’t have any more invitations, but you should come.” Norman went back to his office so excited, that he forgot he even needed to go to the bathroom.\n\nNorman was very careful about picking his outfit. He wanted everything to go right. Last Christmas had been perfectly fine. Norman stayed in with Norman watching CSI re-runs, but he was very much looking forward to Lisa’s party. Christmas, Norman thought, should be spent with people you care about. \n\nNorman knew it was supposed to be cold that night, so he put on one of his favorite sweaters and drove to Lisa’s.\n\nWhen he got to the party, he was one of the first to arrive. He knocked on the door and Lisa answered. She hugged Norman when he came in. She was warm and smelled good, like the women in shampoo commercials must smell like.\n\nLisa left to go to the kitchen and Norman went to a table with chips and dip. His favorite chips were sour cream and onion, but there were only regular chips and BBQ. Norman grabbed a paper plate to put some chips on, but four plates stuck together and he put them all down. He cupped his hand and help some chips there. He didn’t get to try any dip.\n\nRick appeared behind Norman. “Wow, Norman. That’s the ugliest sweater I’ve ever seen.” Norman immediately felt bad and wanted to leave. \n\nLisa came up to them and said, “No, I know. That’s what I said when I saw him.” \n\n“What do you mean?” Norman asked.\n\n“You win. You brought the ugliest sweater.” Rick said.\n\nNorman looked around and realized everyone at the party was wearing a sweater, some more outrageous than others. Rick was wearing a sweater covered in cats that looked like Norman.\n\n“I like your sweater,” said Norman. \n\nA few other people came up to Norman and complimented his sweater, but what they said didn’t feel like compliments. Norman stood around the chips for some time, until he felt strange and wanted to leave.\n\nAs he drove home, Norman felt the grease from the chips against his hand.

One being the spam I've being seeing in comment sections.

The holiday season is approaching, which is the best time for product advertising. Once again, these companies need social media accounts... which the spammers (once again) provide.\n3. The increased population of Redditors has resulted the services offering illicit upvotes losing efficacy.

{ "subreddit" : "lifeofnorman", "title" : "Norman Feels Guilty", "text" : "It was a sunny afternoon.  Today was Norman's day off from work, and he had decided to use his free time to shop for some much-needed groceries.  He noticed Norman was starting to run low on food (his kibble bag was already half-full!) so he made sure to buy some more for him.  Along with this, he had purchased two cans of low-sodium Campbell's tomato soup, which had a special \"buy one get one free\" deal going on for them.  Norman smiled.  He felt proud of his frugality, and was excited to use his coupon.  But as he headed towards the register, something in the snack aisle caught his eye.  \n\n\nIt was a bag of Original Lays potato chips - his favorite.  Norman's mouth watered.  It had been a while since he had last indulged in junk food.  Perhaps just today he could make a small exception.  Hesitantly, he took the bag of chips off of the rack and placed it in his shopping basket next to the two cans of soup.  He glanced over the contents of his basket.  All of a sudden, he remembered his reason for choosing low-sodium tomato soup - he had wanted to start living a healthier lifestyle.  And after thinking long and hard about the possible consequences of his actions, Norman decided to place the chips back on the rack.  \n\n\nWhile paying for his groceries, Norman felt proud of his decision.  Not only had he saved $1.50 with the coupon, but he had also saved an extra $2.00 (and his health) by choosing not buying the potato chips.  Because of this, Norman left the store a happy man.  He had saved lots of money, and now had plenty of food for Norman and himself to enjoy.\n\n\nBut other men were not so fortunate.  Upon exiting the supermarket, someone called out to him.  It was a middle-aged, shaggy-haired man wearing clothes that looked like they hadn't been washed in months.\n\n\n\"Good afternoon sir,\" he said.  \"Spare change for some food?\"\n\n\nNorman looked around anxiously.  Although he did, in fact, have money with him, the homeless man's sudden approach made him feel very tense and uncomfortable.  Without making eye contact, Norman mumbled \"Sorry, I don't have any with me\".  Then quickening his pace, Norman rushed into his car and closed the door.\n\n\nBut as he buckled his seatbelt, an uneasy feeling began to swirl inside Norman.  He didn't like telling such a bold-faced lie.  It wasn't that he didn't want to help the man - he just wasn't comfortable with strangers speaking to him so out of the blue.  He thought about the man, who had been standing out there for hours and probably hadn't eaten in ages.  Norman glanced at his nice bag of groceries. He felt guilty.\n\n\nAt that moment, Norman decided to do something rash.  He unbuckled his seatbelt and stepped out of the car, taking something with him.  The homeless man was still sitting where he had left him - in front of the supermarket doors - when Norman approached.  And, working up his courage, Norman placed one of his cans of tomato soup on the ground next to him.\n\n\nThe homeless man looked up.  Smiling a toothy grin, he thanked Norman for his kindness.  Norman assured him that it was no problem.  Two cans of soup was a lot for just one person, anyway.\n\n\nNorman walked back to his car.

He takes out his debit card, walks out of the car and reads the white hand-written sign that says ‘Cash Only’. Norman puts his card back in its slot and opens up the bills compartment. Norman has a $20 bill and two $1 bills. He decides he’ll do $20 and save the $2 for Norman. \n\nHe walks up to the small window where the middle aged man is sitting and says, “Hello, I’d like to add $20 worth of fuel to my vehicle please. It’s the silver Toyota Corolla over there” Norman points at his vehicle. Norman hands him the money. “Number 3?” Asks the attendant with a heavy middle-eastern accent. Norman looks back at the gas pump to verify that he indeed parked his car in front of pump number 3. Norman turns to face the attendant and with a nervous chuckles blurts out a confirmation.\n\nThe attendant quickly looks away from Norman, punches his fingers into his register and says “OK,” With a dismissive tone. Norman asks for a receipt and the attendant replies, “No receipt.”\n\nWith a little glimmer of disappointment Norman walks back towards his car, opens the fuel door, picks up the fuel nozzle, inserts it in the side of his car and hits ‘87’. \nAs Norman stands there he begins to think about Norman. He missed Norman and he was excited to bring him home some of his favorite food. Norman only feeds Norman wet food once or twice a week. He really enjoyed seeing Norman so happy and loving. Norman would rub himself against Norman’s legs as he prepared his food. \n\nNorman’s thoughts were interrupted when the nozzle stopped fueling. He looked back at the digital display on the pump and it read ‘$18.94’ under Purchase and ’7.72’ under Gallons. Norman remembered that his car has a 13 gallon gas tank and concluded that it was full. He released the nozzle and put it back in its holster. \n\nInstantly, Norman felt a little nervous about going back up to the attendant to ask for his remaining change. Norman felt like it was his fault; that he should have better calculated how much fuel his car needed and how much it was going to cost him. Norman felt guilty for having to go bother the attendant, and for having to make the people behind him wait even longer than they had to. \n\nNorman wanted his change back though, because he thought of it as an extra two cans of wet food for Norman. He gathered his courage and went to ask for his change. The attendant didn’t seem to care and gave Norman $1.06. \n\nNorman smiled tightly as he walked back to his car and drove it to the Family Dollar parking lot. “Norman is going to be so excited!” Norman thought to himself. \n", "comments" : [{ "comment" : "&gt; The thought of being part of the traffic, being included in the report, although anonymously, made him feel involved and noticed.\n\nUtterly adorable." }, { "comment" : "Wow, I never expected Norman to do something as ballsy as ask for his change!

In the late 19th to early 20th centuries similar black notebooks were used by Oscar Wilde, Vincent van Gogh, Pablo Picasso, Ernest Hemingway and Henri Matisse. However, none of them used the present Moleskine-brand notebook since the brand was founded much later.\n\nThe present Moleskine notebook is fashioned after Bruce Chatwin's descriptions of the notebooks he used in his travels. The name itself, \"Moleskine\", is a nickname that Chatwin uses in one of his most celebrated writings, The Songlines (1986). In this book, Chatwin tells the story of his original supplier of notebooks, a Paris stationer who in 1986 informed him that the last notebook manufacturer, a small family-run firm in Tours, had discontinued production that year, after the death of the owner. \"Le vrai Moleskine n’est plus\" (\"The real Moleskine is no more\") are the words Chatwin puts in the mouth of the owner of the stationery shop in Rue de l’Ancienne Comédie." }, { "comment" : "Love the little touches.

He is about to place the check into one of his many pre-addressed envelopes when he notices a hilarious error.  On the line marked 'date' Norman had written in the year 2015 instead of 2016.  He lets out a nearly uncontrollable chuckle at his mistake.  To think what would happen if he had sent it!\n\nGrateful for his catching the mistake, Norman retrieves his checkbook once more to draft a new check.  He uncaps his pen and is about to begin writing when he has the most wickedly clever idea.  Norman grins as returns his attention the entertainingly botched check.  With great precision, Norman traces the lower curve of the five around to close the loop and make the number appear as a six!  He has the urge to hoist his fist in triumph, but thinks better of it.\n\nGlowing with satisfaction, Norman returns the utensils to his desk drawers and places the ingeniously amended check into it's envelope.

{ "subreddit" : "lifeofnorman", "title" : "Book of Norman Update #9- What's Next", "text" : "So I think it's been about 5 months since my last official update, which is a good deal of time. The plus side is that those were not an idle 5 months. I'm sorry to have to say that the book will not continue on.\n\nThings are really tough- my plate is full of school, other projects, things that come and go and the book is... Pushing it. Over the last few months, I've realized that this isn't worth the time it's taking. Sometimes you just have to cut your losses and move on. It's been fun, reading hundreds of Norman stories, moderating, and meeting new people, but I'm afraid this is going to be the end. \n\nEh. Just screwing with you all. Seriously, after a bloody *year* of collecting stories and surrounding my life with a 40 year old lonely man and a cat, I can't give up now. We're so close!\n\nVery close in fact. Just yesterday, I finished editing the first draft of all the stories. Really, all that entitled was cleaning up grammar here and there, separating page long paragraphs into digestible chunks, and doing some continuity work. There's no need for Norman's boss to have 17 names.\n\nAlso, on the side, I've been organizing the stories throughout a calendar year. I decided the year the book will take place is 2011, simply because it's close enough to work with all the modern references, while also having things like a landline not be totally obscure. What I've done is copy every story, the title, the author, a synopsis of the story, little notes (like if the story mentions his cat, or if it takes place in a certain season), as well as a little rating out of ten. Then, I made a massive calendar out of black bristleboard, covered my walls in the stuff, and stuck the notes onto the slots. It makes it look like I'm a serial killer.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/8cfXrQR.jpg\n\nSo, now that the editing is done, the only thing standing in between me and a first draft of the book is fixing the calendar. That shouldn't take more than a week, depending on how fast I move about it. I'm about 75% through it. \n\nSo naturally the next thing to happen would be to get some beta readers going on it. Luckily, I feel like there's a few of you that will be willing to give the book a shot. I have something in mind, where each reader will be given a different task to make notes of different things in the book. For example, I forgot to mark off which stories Norman goes grocery shopping, or which stories mention him having a cellphone. So instead of reading the entire thing over again, I'll kill a few birds and get everyone to notice different mistakes.\n\nSo how do you become a beta-reader? Simple enough. Ask to be a beta reader in the comments. Just let me know you're interested. \n\nBut it's not that simple. Once you comment, I'm not going to accept you- not just yet. Five days from now, after you've commented and said that you're interested, send me a PM that you're *still* interested. Then I'll let you come along.\n\nWhy the dance? Well, mostly because from what I've learned over the years is that people are always willing to lend a hand, but very rarely actually want to do anything about it. I'm just figuring that if you can't remember, or don't care to, talk to me about the project again a mere five days from now, chances are you wouldn't have sat down and read an entire novel for me.\n\nSo anyways, that's the deal; that's where things stand. I'm aiming to have everything done by January 2016, hopefully getting the book released for New Years, which will fit well with the books year format. Also, /u/Jolly_Line_Rhymer has been working on getting a cover for the book. What's he's shown me so far is fantastic, but we'll wait for a more finalized version before I show all of you guys. \n\nStay tuned.", "comments" : [{ "comment" : "You bastard.

{ "subreddit" : "lifeofnorman", "title" : "Norman watches \"The Jinx\" with his son", "text" : "Norman's son was coming around for his every-other-month visit and as usual brought a USB with movies and TV shows on it. It was normal for Norman's son to bring movies for them to watch throughout the afternoon or night. Sometimes Norman wished he could have a good chat with his son, but his son always insisted on watching something. Norman put this down to his son being part of a different generation. \n\nNorman didn't mind what they watched, so his son started playing the first episode of the 2015 HBO documentary miniseries *The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst* as something to put on. Norman's son said he'd watched it before and that his father might like it. Norman never liked the shows that his son showed him but always said he liked them, not wanting to admit some of the stuff his son liked seemed weird or artsy or depressing to Norman. \n\nThat night Norman and his son broke their unspoken rule about not spending more than four hours in each other's company by binge-watching every episode of The Jinx. Norman was utterly engrossed, to an extent that even astounded his son. Over the course of the series, Norman engaged with his son by offering unsolicited opinions after certain revelations. When a Galveston, Texas jury was revealed to have found the subject of the documentary, Robert Durst, not guilty of the murder of Morris Black, Norman muttered, \"Unbelievable.\" When Durst revealed he had lied on the night of his wife's disappearance, Norman clucked his tongue and shook his head. When Susan Berman's murder was explored half-way through the series, Norman commented, \"You know he did it. We all know he did it,\" and at the end of episode 5 Norman exclaimed, \"Holy moley\" when a discovered envelope revealed that Durst shared Berman's killer's handwriting style and, as in a note sent to the police by Berman's killer, Durst had misspelled the word \"Beverly\". \n\nNorman watched the final episode in a tense forward body position, leaning his elbows on his knees, poised on the edge of the couch for the entire episode. At the end, Norman clapped a hand to his head and audibly gasped when Durst appeared to confess to three murders while alone in the bathroom. As the screen faded to black, Norman spouted: \"Got ya! You... you... *fuck*\", causing his son to smile for some reason. \n\nThe next morning at work, Norman could not get The Jinx or Robert Durst out of his head. Loading up Yahoo! rather than starting on his first project for the day, Norman immediately searched for the term \"Robert Durst\". Various links revealed that Durst was awaiting trial in declining health. Norman also learned that the family of Durst's missing first wife watched the final episode live when it initially aired on television alongside the producers of the program, and that the family cried with happiness as they felt they had some partial closure. \n\nNorman was startled when Chris from I.T. appeared beside him, speaking in a bored tone about updating the system. Norman realized an hour of work had already passed but unusually, this did not bother him. Norman asked Chris, \"Did you see this?\" pointing at the screen. Chris immediately perked up and both men had an animated conversation for five minutes, with Chris inviting Norman to join him and the other I.T. guys for lunch. During lunch in the break room, Norman and his coworkers feverishly discussed Durst's physical appearance including his nervous tic and trademark dark eyes, Durst's probable mental state, the word \"cadaver\", Los Angeles law on killing a witness to a crime, the death penalty, the nature of evil, and the seeming naivete of a man called Andrew Jarecki. \n\nWhen lunch ended, Norman agreed he would download the podcast for something called \"Serial\" and decided he would break his rule of calling his son no sooner than two weeks after a visit by phoning him that very night.

He paused as he placed his keys into the front door, and then turned the lock. The air felt stiff in the hall way, the clink of his keys in the empty candy bowl made him jump. Norman was aware of every move he made, however as if on auto-pilot he had no control over his actions, he was a forced audience of one to his own life.\n\n\nThe television was turned off in the living room and Norman saw his own reflection in the blank screen. His almond hair was starting to thin and he'd recently become quite self conscious of his receding hairline. On instinct of seeing his own reflection he straightened his tie and made sure his work shirt was properly tucked into his pants, \"there's never a reason to be untidy\" he thought to himself. Reassured with his appearance he turned towards the half open master bedroom door. He could faintly hear on the other side the sound of movement. Norman's hand hovered over the knob, the commotion had stopped in the room. Norman nudged the door open, the beige carpet being slightly too high answered a gentle 'shh', this was the first time he had ever noticed the sound. \n\n\nMelinda stood in front of an open suitcase on the bed, an unfolded skirt was clutched in her fist, her gaze never broke as she thrust it in to the pile of mismatched outfits. “I'm home” said Norman. His eyes betrayed the smile on his lips while he stood awkwardly in the door frame, he was waiting for her to move first like a chess player who knows he's already been beat. \n\n\n“I've been fucking another man, Norman”, he knew. \n\n“He's younger than you, Norman.” he didn't know that. \n\n“I know.” He said more matter-of-factually than he'd intended. \n\nThey stared at each other, Norman's hands felt uncomfortable. He glanced down to the carpet and then over to the dresser. Things were missing but he couldn't put his finger on what. He noticed that the jewelry box next to the unlit candles was open, and the picture frame had been knocked over. Melinda slammed the suitcase shut and shoved past Norman as if he were a stranger on the street. He staggered slightly, and turned around to follow once he had heard she was opening the front door. \n\n“Norman!” she yelled as he was rounding the corner. He was about to speak but was interrupted by Norman Jr.'s footsteps on the stairs. He went out the door without even looking back at his father. His wife's suitcase banged against the wall leaving a scuff, Norman flinched. He followed behind them and stood on the porch just as his wife had reached the bottom of the gray cement steps. \n\nMelinda stopped and turned around, she looked at Norman not with hate, not with anger or resentment, but with disdain. He loved her. \n\n“Why don't we ever fight? I just want to be normal, Norman.” \n\nNorman's mind echoed silence. When the momentary trance lifted, he saw his wife slam the sliding door shut on the minivan with Norman Jr. in the back seat. She reversed through the lawn around Norman's car and then accelerated down the street. \n\n\nNorman watched the minivan disappear around the corner and then sat down. Overhead a single puffy cloud trekked across the pale blue sky. ", "comments" : [{ "comment" : "Wtf happened to running out of coffee or being Norman at the office... This shits too dark yo.

{ "subreddit" : "lifeofnorman", "title" : "Norman drinks port", "text" : "In Christmas of 2013, Norman had received a bottle of port. He had never drank port before, but, feeling adventurous, Norman decided that on this night he would give it a try. \n\nNorman pulled a wine glass out from his cupboard. He placed it on his counter top.\n\n\"Here goes,\" Norman said as Norman's eyes followed Norman's hands. \n\nNorman unwrapped the top of the bottle. \"Is this a twist top or the kind you open with a bottle opener?\" Norman asked himself worriedly. Norman didn't own a bottle opener; he had never seen a need for one. He had almost considered buying one, once, when Lisa had invited him to a gift shop to look for gifts for her cousin's wedding. He had eyed it for a good long time - it was silver and had a flared base which appealed to Norman's sensibilities. A practical implement for a practical man. But he rarely drank alcohol, instead preferring water - or warm milk before bed. This port thing was a radical departure from the norm for him. \n\nThe bottle was corked. Norman breathed a sigh of relief. There was no need for such adventures tonight. He was about to sit down for CSI when...\n\nNorman noticed, with very mild anxiety, that underneath the cork were two words: \n\nTWIST. HERE.\n\nNorman had had no idea that a bottle with a cork could also be twisted open. What now? If he twisted the bottle open would the cork fly off? Would port spill all over his linoleum?\n\nNorman remembered that his fortune cookie from when he had ordered in Chinese on Tuesday night had said that Norman needed to expand his horizons. So Norman wandered outside, on to the grass.\n\n\"Here I am a grown man standing out on his back lawn, opening up a bottle of port!\" Norman said. Norman let out a meow as Norman twisted the cork. Once. Twice. Three times. Norman was half expecting it to fly out over the fence. \n\nBut the cork came out easily with no hassle. It didn't pop out at all. No liquid spilled anywhere, although a slightly sweet aroma reached Norman's nose. \n\nNorman walked back to his much brighter kitchen. Now, the bottle said \"Fortified Wine\", so it only made sense that it would be drank much the same as wine. Norman poured one third of a glass.\n\n\"There's no turning back now,\" said Norman. \"Tomorrow, I will wake up a man who has tasted port.\"\n\nNorman took a sip. The drink was actually quite tasty! A little on the sweet side, yet inoffensive. Norman would have a new treat - port - to go with his familiar treat - CSI.\n\nSeveral sips later, however, Norman realized that he had made a mistake. The drink, after a few sips, was too sweet! His mouth now felt cloying.\n\n\"This is what I get for trying something new,\" Norman said sourly. He poured the remainder of the port into the sink. \n\nThe next day at work, Norman was feeling grumpy and told everyone who would listen about his plight from the night before. Most of his colleagues were too busy to help him, and needed to get back to work before he had even finished the part of his story about not being able to figure out which direction to twist the cork in.  Luckily Albert from IT had some valuable advice:\n\n\"Norman, port is a sipping drink,\" Albert explained patiently. \"You don't just pour yourself a full glass and drink it like wine! The reason you only enjoyed the first sip is because you are supposed to only have a little. Try just putting a mouthful's worth at the bottom of your glass tonight instead.\"\n\nWith a spring in his step, Norman got back to preparing fringe benefit tax returns. \n\nIt wasn't until that afternoon that Norman stretched, got up and wandered over to the water cooler. He drew out a plastic cup, held it under the tap and pressed the switch for room temperature water. He filled it almost all the way to the top. \n\n\"I'm certainly not ever drinking port in this quantity!\" Norman chuckled quietly to himself as he brought the plastic cup to his lips.

When he reaches the fruit section however, he learns that Mandarins are no longer in season and won't be available for the next few months.  Norman thinks for a moment about how the farmers and orchard owners in Spain, where the last bag was from according to the sticker, must be glad to have a few months off work.  After daydreaming for about fifteen minutes about what it would be like to be a Spanish orange farmer, Norman decides to go back to his old ways and just get a bag of plain old [oranges](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/3qpt82/norman_eats_a_mandarin/).  He spends another five minutes or so looking for a bag full of oranges that all seem ripe, but not too ripe so that they'll last a while in his refrigerator at home.  He selects a bag which is a pretty red color that he didn't remember seeing before.  \"Perhaps it is a new brand,\" he thinks to himself while standing in the checkout line.  It is only just before he reaches the register however, that he realizes that what he holds in his hand is a bag of blood oranges.  Norman has never heard of a blood orange before and doesn't exactly wish to try them now, but as the cashier's voice snaps him out of his thoughts, he realizes that it is far too late to put them back.  They cost 22 cents more than regular oranges.\n\nThe next day, being almost late for work after his alarm failed to go off (though he was thankfully woken by Norman jumping up on his bed in order to lead him to his empty food bowl) Norman hurriedly grabbed an orange from the bag, not remembering that it was a different kind of orange until precisely 10:30 am when he began to peel it.  \"I suppose this is why they call it a blood orange,\" Norman muses slightly aloud as he notes the ruby red color of the fruit, remembering yesterday's escapade at the grocery store as he does.  Figuring he may as well at least eat this one so as not to waste the whole bag, Norman finds himself pleasantly surprised at the tart, yet mild flavor which is more robust than a normal orange.  Norman even goes so far as to imagine himself having a lengthy conversation about blood oranges with Lisa, who in his thoughts is quite impressed with how discerning he is in his citrus tastes.  He did not see Lisa that day, but figures that a conversation of that nature may happen since she seemed interested in Mandarins earlier.  \n\nA week later, Norman never did manage to talk about blood oranges with Lisa, but has grown quite fond of them and resolves to buy another bag, theorizing a possible yearly routine of buying Mandarins when they are in season and blood oranges when they aren't.  As he nears the fruit section his thoughts return to reality as he searches for the blood oranges.  After nearly twenty minutes of searching the whole fruit section of the store multiple times, he finds none of the distinctive pretty red bags.  After an additional ten minutes spent waiting for a nearby store employee to finish restocking grapefruits Norman learns, to his slight dismay, that blood oranges are now also out of season.  With a bag of ordinary navel oranges in his hand, Norman slowly walks to the cashier, thinking about how orange farmers in Italy must also enjoy their vacations.

In fact, Norman didn't even know what Geocaching was.\n\n\"Uhm... I'm sorry I don't know what Geocaching is.\" responded Norman. He wasn't sure if it was common knowledge or not, so he felt cautious about responding too cluelessly.\n\n\"Ah, fair enough. It's fun. I think you'll enjoy it.\" said Ralph, before going on to explain what Geocaching was to Norman. Norman didn't really understand fully, something about hidden boxes and GPS, but Norman had seen an extra exciting episode of CSI last night. Why not give it a go, thought Norman.\n\n\"Alright. I'll join you.\" confirmed Norman aloud.\n\n\"Great!\" beamed Ralph. \"I'll catcha at the park tomorrow!\" he finished as clicked his fingers and gave Norman a thumbs up as he walked away.\n\nSaturday morning at 10am, Norman left his house and walked to the park.

As the two walked further and further into the park, Norman noticed less and less people around. Suddenly, Ralph stopped walking and took a sharp turn, and was now looking at a tree. Norman took a step back and decided to let Ralph do his thing, he didn’t want to interfere. Ralph turned his head around the trunk of the tree and snapped back to visit Norman. \n\n“Go on Norm, have a look behind the tree.” smiled Ralph. \n\nNorman was hesitant but felt assured nothing bad would happen. He looked behind the tree and saw a small plastic box, painted black, and lightly covered with dead leaves. He picked it up and showed Ralph. Before Norman could say anything, Ralph congratulated him. \n\n“Hey hey! Found your first Geocache!” Ralph beamed again. Norman was still slightly confused, however was quite happy to oblige Ralph by opening the box. \n\nInside, there was a small note pad and a few trinkets. A dice, a playing card, and a plastic fish.\n\n“If you open that notepad up,” explained Ralph “you’ll see the names of all the other people who have been here before us.” \n\nNorman did just that and saw pages and pages of people’s names and dates, signing that they had in fact been in the very place that Norman now stood. Norman felt a sense of wonder, excitement, he felt part of a secret society that no one knew about. Why, before just now, Norman had walked past this place many many times and had never even knew about this being here. Norman paused and took a moment to think about it all. \n\n“This is actually pretty fun.” \n\nRalph explained that if Norman wanted to, he’d swap in one of his trinkets, a little plastic cow, for the fish for Norman to keep. Norman was touched by this gesture and was eager to accept. \n\nNorman and Ralph found 2 more Geocaches in the park that day. One by the river stream, and one very very small one under a park bench which was attached with a magnet. After the day out, Norman and Ralph said goodbye. Norman was satisfied to be back at home, but he was still very satisfied he took a chance and went out. \n\nOnce he sat down in his chair, Norman pounced onto Norman’s lap. \n\n“Hello Norman,” said Norman as he pulled the plastic fish out of his pocket. “You’ll never guess what I did today...”\n", "comments" : [{ "comment" : "I love this :) Seeing Norman get out and do small things that are awesome makes me all warm and fuzzy!" }, { "comment" : "I'm glad you like it :) I love the idea of this sub, but for my own welfare, I can't stick around very long unless there's a few happy moments along the way as well so I decided to contribute." }, { "comment" : "The idea isn't for Norman to have a bad or sad life, just a NORMAL one.

Username Norman_N_Norman. \n\n\"Perfect,\" he thought as a smile spread across his lips,\n\nHe began to type, his fingers sightly trembling. \"Hello\" Norman entered into the dialogue box and then clicked send. \n\nHe received a message back almost immediately, \"Hi, ASL?\"\n\n\"ASL\" Norman thought to himself, \"what does ASL mean?\"  \n\nNorman finally figured it'd be best to ignore it and typed \"How are you doing today?\" but instead of a reply two other users this time typed the same strange message \"ASL? ASL?\"\n\n\"What is going on here?\" Norman frowned, dismayed at the progress of his attempt to connect with others.  Norman closed the AOL window and carefully removed the CD from its drive and placed it in a jewel case he had purchased specially for this occasion.  \"Well I guess that was a waste too.\" he said to himself as he puled the price sticker off the case before placing it on the nearby shelf. \n\nTo this day Norman has still not cancelled his subscription to AOL.   \n", "comments" : [{ "comment" : "I was hoping for that ending as soon as you said he was entering his credit card number.

Norman had never returned a book late, nor did he want to deprive a fellow citizen of a literary experience. \n\n\n\nAs he walked up to the library, Norman pondered what he should check out next.  He should probably pick up a form to renew his library card; after all, it was set to expire in another 6 months. Norman looked down at his books - he was pleased with his most recent selections and was grateful to live only a few bus stops from the nearest library. Norman was a lucky guy.\n\n\n\nOnce at the door, Norman noticed a long line of people waiting in the lobby. Not one to skip, he positioned himself in the back of the group and decided to pass the time in line by reading more about everyone’s favorite lasagna-loving fat cat. He moved slowly along with the line, his nose buried in the strips of the book.  \n\n\n\n“That cat REALLY likes lasagna.” Norman commented to himself. “I wonder if Norman would like it.  He’d probably become terribly sick -  best to stick to cat food.”\n\n\n\nAfter a few pages, Norman noticed the line in front of him had dispersed. He looked up and saw a large “Speed Dating” sign hanging on a nearby wall. Written below it read: “Brought to you by the Lonely Hearts Association at your local public library”. Norman realized that he was not in line for book returns. Norman had been in line to go on a date.\n\n\n\nEveryone had taken a seat at the tables around the library and Norman found himself in front of an empty chair. Across the table, a woman with a wide grin on her face looked at him expectantly, waiting for him to sit down. Norman looked towards the exit and then back at the woman seated in front of him.\n\n\n\n“Well?” The woman said “Why don’t you take a seat before someone snaps me up?” she giggled and winked.\n\n\n\nNorman was at a loss for words. “I… uhhh-I... buhh…” A bead of sweat rolled down his back and the blood rushed to his face.\n\n\n\nThe woman’s smile faded and her expression became a mix of confused and concerned as Norman sputtered. “Are you alright?” she asked.\n\n\n\n“Garfield.” He managed.\n\n\n\nThe woman paused, not sure what to do with the information she had just been given, but decided to put on her best smile and extended her hand. “Hi Garfield. I’m Debra. It’s a pleasure to meet you.”\n\n\n\nThis had not improved Norman’s situation. \n\n\n\n“N-n-no, I-I mean the cat.” He stammered.\n\n\n\n“...Cat?” Debra’s hand hung limply in the air.\n\n\n\nNorman’s desire to explain was outweighed by his urgent need to escape. He forced a hurried apology - “Sorry, need to go, goodbye”.\n\n\n\nNorman turned, dropped his books down the return chute (there hadn’t been a line after all), and retreated out the door of the library. The next bus wasn’t scheduled to arrive for another 20 minutes, so he began walking home, eager to leave the speed daters behind.\n\n\n\nBack in the library, Lisa frowned as her first speed date began. She had seen Norman show up for the event, but was saddened to see him leave right when it began. She had hoped for the chance to get to know Norman a little better. She briefly considered bringing it up to him at work on Monday, but decided it would be better not to. Perhaps he left because he thought speed dating was silly and would think less of her for partaking.\n", "comments" : [{ "comment" : "Classic, and love the Lisa tie-in." }, { "comment" : "&gt; \"That cat REALLY loves lasagna,\" Norman commented to himself\n\nNorman-ic fucking gold." }, { "comment" : "Who knew a trip to the library could be so nerve-racking?

If he gets 30% off, Norman would not be the one to blame. He decided to go all in on this opportunity and grab the yoghurt. It might just work after all. Though he wasn't too sure. He did get a little nervous.\n\nAt the check-out he had already forgotten about this. But then he saw how the cashier swiped his yoghurts over the scanner. Seeing the 30% off sticker, the cashier promptly typed something into his screen and miraculously, Norman did get 30% off on that one. His little fraud had worked.\n\nAlleviated and feeling just a little unlawful, Norman headed home. He thought back on this incident when opening his yoghurt while watching CSI.

[**Etymology and spelling**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogurt#Etymology_and_spelling) of article  [**Yogurt**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogurt): [](#sfw) \n\n---\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;The word is derived from [Turkish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_language): *yoğurt*,  and is usually related to the verb *yoğurmak*: \"to be curdled or coagulated; to thicken\".  or *yuğur-* \"id\" and the [suffix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix) *-t*.  The letter [ğ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%9E) was traditionally rendered as \"gh\" in transliterations of Turkish prior to 1928.  In older Turkish, the letter denoted a [voiced velar fricative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_velar_fricative) /ɣ/, but this sound is [elided](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elision) between [back vowels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_vowel) in modern Turkish, in which the word is pronounced [jo\u02c8uɾt], or [jo\u02c8ɰuɾt].\n\n&gt;In English, there are several variations of the spelling of the word, including *yogurt*, *yoghurt* and to a lesser extent *yoghourt*, *yogourt*, *yaghourt*, *yahourth*, *yoghurd*, *joghourt*, and *jogourt*. In the United Kingdom and Australia, *yogurt* and *yoghurt* are both current, *yogurt* being used by the Australian and British dairy councils, and *yoghourt* is an uncommon alternative. In the United States, *yogurt* is the usual spelling and *yoghurt* a minor variant. In New Zealand, *yoghurt* is preferred by the *New Zealand Oxford Dictionary*. In Canada, *yogurt* is most common among English speakers although \"yoghurt\" is also used, but many brands use *yogourt*, since it is an acceptable spelling in both English and French, the official languages of Canada.\n\n&gt;Historically there have also been cases of yogurt being spelt with a \"J\" instead of a \"Y\" (e.g. *jogurt* and *joghurt*) due to alternative transliteration methods. However, there has been a decline in these variations in English speaking countries, but in certain European countries it is still commonly spelt with a \"J\". Most people tend to spell in the manner shown on the packaging of the major brands in their country.\n\n&gt;\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Soy ^yogurt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soy_yogurt) ^| [^List ^of ^yogurt-based ^dishes ^and ^beverages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_yogurt-based_dishes_and_beverages) ^| [^Frozen ^yogurt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_yogurt) ^| [^Tutti ^Frutti ^Frozen ^Yogurt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutti_Frutti_Frozen_Yogurt) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+crckltd) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+crckltd)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)" }, { "comment" : "That must be some sexy yogurt " }, { "comment" : "There are other errors you could have picked up on besides the ones which are correct in other languages." }] }

Norman wasn’t one to travel often, but today he was getting on a plane to go to a conference for work. ‘It’ll be good to go someplace new for once,’ Norman had thought when the idea was proposed to him by his boss. Norman arrived at the airport 2.5 hours before his plane was to board, giving him adequate time to check his luggage and get through security without any trouble. He did just that, and sat at the terminal patiently waiting for his 7am flight.\n \nBeing up so early, Norman hadn’t gotten a chance to eat breakfast, and his stomach was starting to rumble. It was now 6 o’clock, and Norman decided to go get a bagel from a coffee shop near another gate. By the time he made it, it was 6:05; Norman had 25 minutes before boarding would start. He got in line and looked at the menu to check his options, even though he’d probably stick with his favorite – a plain bagel with a little cream cheese. The line was moving much slower than Norman had expected. It was now 6:15, and Norman wondered if he should just forget about the bagel and wait to eat until after his flight. Unfortunately, Norman noticed that there were now a few people behind him. It would look pretty strange to give up now and excuse himself from the line. As the minutes passed, Norman became more and more anxious. He finally got his bagel (plain with cream cheese, indeed) and rushed back to his gate. As he arrived Norman checked the time – 6:25. He had made it after all and the plane wasn’t even boarding yet.\n\nNorman found a spot where he could eat alone and in peace, and even had time to finish his entire bagel before his section of the plane was called for boarding. He thought back on his actions and realized how silly he’d been to worry so much about being late. Even so, it might be a better idea to just wake up early and make oatmeal next time, Norman thought to himself. \n", "comments" : [{ "comment" : "I find this one very relatable.

Tonight, that would change.\n\nNorman drove up to an old, rundown apartment block. He was shocked that this is where his parents lived. He slowly walked up the door, and used the directory to find his mother's name. His father's name was listed next to it, but was extremely faded.\n\nHe buzzed the number, 309. The voice cracked through the speaker.\n\n\"Hello?\"\n\nNorman recognized the voice as his mother's. After all these years, it hadn't changed a bit.\n\n\"Mom, it's Norman.\"\n\nThe voice on the other end fell silent. You could hear the feedback coming through, a sure sign she was still on the line, but clearly she was speechless. The door buzzed, and Norman entered the building. \n\nHe walked up the steep stairs to the third floor, which were earily reminiscent of his parent's old house. He remembered the last time he walked up those stairs and how much his life had changed since them. He wondered what effect this visit would have on his life.\n\nHe approached his parent's suite, and before he had the chance to knock, his mother opened the door. They stared at eachother briefly.\n\nShe was still small, her silver hair was pushed into a bun. Her face was wrinkled, definitely a lot older than Norman remembered. Her striking blue eyes which Norman always thought gave a cold gaze, looked tired and helpless. Without speaking, she grabbed Norman and gave him a squeezing hug. All the pain he had felt that day, all the worry he had about the future was almost immediately alleviated. He was home, in his mother's arms.\n\nAs his mother welcomed him into her home, he noticed it was nearly top to bottom with pictures. Pictures of Norman's parents, grandparents and even of Norman himself. He smiled as he walked through the small space.\n\nNorman sat on the couch. The suite was surprisingly big, for a one bedroom apartment. Norman's mother was shuffling through some papers on a desk. She pulled out an envelope and handed it to Norman.\n\n\"He wanted you to have this,\" Norman clutched the envelope tightly. He saw his name scribed across it and recognized the handwriting; it was his father's. Suddenly, Norman's worst fears seemed almost confirmed. He knew it was the cancer was serious but had always wished his father has pulled through. This letter confirmed that he didn't.\n\nTears welled in Norman's eyes as he read the letter. Norman's father asked for his forgiveness, apologized for his actions, but it was the final words that really struck Norman.\n\n\"Norman, what I said was completely out of line. I want you to know that no matter what happens in your life I'm proud of you. As I lay here dying, surrounded by only your mother, I don't want you to make the same mistakes I did. Don't push people away, pull them in. And remember, I always love you.\"\n\nAs Norman wiped the tears from his eyes he looked at his mother, who was standing above him. She also had tears welling up, but she smiled. Norman knew how grateful she must have been to see him, and he felt the same way.\n\n\"Do you want to eat something, Normy?\n\nNorman stayed with his mother for a couple years after that, until she, too, grew ill and passed away. Norman never cried much when his mother passed because he knew his father would take care of her. Norman still missed her quite a lot, and decided he'd have to move out.\n\nNorman Jr. helped Norman move. Junior had never spent time at his grandmother's house, he had seen her before, but had never been inside.\n\n\"Dad, you should just stay here. Maybe redecorate or something, but this place is so big compared to your new place.\"\n\nNorman smiled, patted Junior on the head and handed him a box. As Junior left, Norman gazed across the room one last time. The pictures his mother put up still hung on the wall. Norman turned off the lights and left.\n\nAs he entered the hallway, he was stopped by the building manager.\n\n\"You're supposed to give one month of notice before you move out.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm not living here anymore but I'll continue to rent the space.\"\n\nNorman hadn't been able to visit his parents for nearly 20 years. He kept their apartment entact so he would never have to experience that again. He could visit them whenever he wanted.", "comments" : [{ "comment" : "I usually read Norman stories to fall asleep but now I'm gonna call my mom so my day doesn't end on such a sad note.

He noted to himself that there was a steak and shake near his house. \"Maybe I should stop and get one\" He thought. He remembered that he had gotten an Oreo one, and it was nice. But then Norman thought about how the steak and shake was a block in the opposite direction of his house, and he would have to drive right past his neighborhood to get to it. Norman thought that maybe that was too much fuss for a milkshake. Although it was still very close, and maybe he could try the chocolate banana.  He remembered that last time he couldn't decide between Oreo and Chocolate Banana and although the Oreo was good, it would be nice to see what the chocolate banana would be like. Norman drove on, thinking about milkshakes. As he neared his neighborhood he began to second guess himself. Wondering if he really should stop and get a milkshake. It sure was a lot of sugar for a Tuesday afternoon. And he wondered if it was silly to drink a milkshake for no reason. \"You know,\" Norman though, \"It might  be nice to be spontaneous, just this one time.\" And he got a little excited upon deciding that he would, in fact, get the milkshake. Norman even smiled a little to himself as he drove. His neighborhood was coming up on the left. And he could see that the light for the turn lane was green. Norman usually had to sit and wait for a while till the light turned green. It would make no sense for him to drive past his neighborhood when the light was green, just to get a milkshake he hadn't even been thinking about till five minutes ago, and then turn around. I'll just head home, he though, getting into the turn lane, thinking about what the chocolate banana milkshake would've tasted like.

That can mean anything you can derive from it; whether it's winning a scratch ticket, or simply saying hi to the bus driver.\n\nI'll give out two reddit golds. One is for the highest rated story following this theme, and the second will be a personal choice, based more on originality and writing strength.

Thing is, three weeks after that, Norman had won again, at the 7/11 across the street from the first gas station. Norman couldn't believe his luck, and when he won again the very next week at yet again the very next store, Norman believed his luck would never end. A framed photograph of Norman smiling gleefully with three equal sums of 10,000 dollars, placed above the battery rack and below the cigarettes, and when finally Norman's luck ended with a winnings of a diminished 50 dollar scratchie, the clerk was still nice enough to take one last framed photograph to concrete his legacy throughout the eight block radius.\n\nA lot had changed about Norman in the last fifteen years. 20,000 of the 30,050 in winnings went towards his wedding, 5,000 going towards the honeymoon, and four years later, after the last bit cash disappeared in bills and an arduous amount of lottery tickets, nothing was left to cover the cost of the divorce.

He scratched his head.\n\n\"Now listen here,\" scorned the old woman at the front, \"Three oranges is a *win!* I don't know what I'm entitled to, but I won... Something!\" The tired clerk took the scratchie. Finally reading the back of the ticket, the clerk learned that indeed the woman had won, and unknown to the both of them until now, she had won *big.*\n\n\"Mam... You won the jackpot.\" whispered the clerk, in awe.\n\n\"I knew it!\" \n\n\"... You won a million dollars...\"\n\n\"I...

The print of Young Norman was now tucked behind her grinning face. \n\nLater on, after Norman finally paid for his crisps and soda, Norman gave her a hug, and wished her the best of luck. \"I'm the luckiest Nancy in the whole wide world!\" she said, with her uncontrollable joy.\n", "comments" : [] }

He wanted to get Norman some food, and maybe some treats if they have any of the good ones left.\n\n\nHe got to an intersection, and both him and another car (which had its music a tiny bit too loud) stopped at the same time. Norman looked and smiled as he waved them to pass. He got a hand up with smiles from both passengers, who happened to be two beautiful blonde ladies.\n\nAs Norman's turn was next, he saw something in back of their car that surprised him. It was a Florida license plate, with those oranges on it. As he looked under it, he blinked quickly and became even more surprised!\n\nUnder the license plate was a sticker that said \"Honk If You're Horny!!!\". Norman looked at it, looked at the blonde hair that was showing from the car in front of him, then looked at his horn!\n\n\"No\" Norman said to himself. That's a crazy thought. He felt guilty of how badly he wanted to press it in that instant. \n\nHe thought of so many things like \"What would Cindy from work think of me if she saw me from another car? These women are my sons age. Am I an old creep for wanting to press it?\". \n\n\nHe finally got away from them as he entered the parking lot for the pet store.

There, in the store window, atop the green felt display top, sat an old videogame console that he had enjoyed as a kid. He recalled the taste of the soda he'd sip as he cruised through game after game on late Saturday nights, the laughter of his childhood pals at sleepovers, and the clicks and beeps that made up the theme songs that occasionally got stuck in his head even to this day. Norman considered purchasing it, it was cheap, and he had cut back on sweets to a degree so he had a small ammount more cash than usual this month.

Elmore once again coughed violently into Norman’s napkin, which Norman did not appreciate, since Elmore had dirtied his own napkin, and all the napkins on the surrounding tables. He could have asked the waitress for another instead of stealing from Norman, and Norman would have spoken up about all of his concerns, if it weren’t for the fact his mind was preoccupied with another one of Elmore’s devious attempts at being a thief. Soon, the two men would be robbing this restaurant- a portly sum of a twenty six dollar bill. \n\n“Ready, sonny?” shouted Elmore, unaware of the volume of his voice. Norman shushed Elmore. Elmore shushed him back.\n\n“I’m going to use the toilet first. Plan your escape, Norman. Don’t blow it.”\n\nElmore waddled his way to the toilet, leaving Norman to be a fearful pool of sweat in his chair, afraid of prison, afraid of being caught and scorned by the manager, afraid of two outcomes he learned from movies of what becomes of restaurant thieves- either he would be forced to wash dishes until he made up his dues, or have his photo taken and placed on a wall of other guilty hooligans who dare steal from Smitties.\n\nNorman couldn’t handle the pressure. He decided on two things in the moments that followed: 1) He would let Elmore leave the restaurant first, allowing Norman to secretly pay for the bill before the victimizing old man could notice Norman’s caring and cowardly tactic, and 2) He would never eat at Smitties again. He hears good things about Denny’s, or IHOP, or the inexpensive alternative of making pancakes at home. He decided to stop by the bookstore, pick up a book specializing in breakfast foods, and that was that.\n\nNeither of those plans would happen that night.
