</thread><thread title=[Norman gets Pokemon Go] author=[DwelveDeeper] text=[Norman had been hearing all this news about Pokemon Go and decided to download the app on his new smartphone. He remembered Norman junior used to be obsessed with Pokemon in his younger years, and now that it was making a comeback, he decided to see what all the fuss was about.

He created his character, naming it Norman1970, because "Norman" was already taken. "Boy, there sure are a lot of Norman's in the world," he said to Norman, scratching him behind the ears. He chose his "monster," he thought the blue little turtle looked cute

"Now what?" Norman thought to himself. Nothing was happening.

He thought maybe Norman Jr would know. He texted him, "Hi Norman! I just got that new Pokeman app. Have you got it yet?"

Almost immediately he received a reply, excitedly, Norman checked his phone. "Hey dad, yeah it's great! And it's Pokemon"

Confused by the last sentence, but ignoring it, Norman replied, "yeah it is fun. Is there a way for me to be friends with you on it?"

"No, not yet."

Disappointed, Norman replied, "Okay, we'll have fun. Don't forget to play your turn on Words with Friends!"

Norman didn't receive a reply, "he must be busy playing that new Pokeman game," thought Norman. He opened up the app again, but still didn't understand what to do and couldn't find any instructions. Sighing, Norman laid down his phone and turned on an old episode of CSI. About 30 minutes in, his phone buzzed with a notification that Norman Jr had played a word.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4tuill/norman_gets_pokemon_go/] createDate=[1469092962] score=[806] numComments=[29]>

<comment number=[1]author=[lagerdalek]text=[Maurice was always the popular, handsome one. 

Norman felt pretty annoyed that he was ignored so much at work but a simple one-liner from Maurice had them all so wowed, but secretly he was also chuffed that his coworkers mistook Maurice for him.

Norman took an extra long look at himself in the mirror that night. Maybe he was a little handsome, he had Maurice's strong jawline, and he had more hair.

Turning to his bedroom, Norman subconsciously stopped pulling his stomach in.

<comment number=[7]author=[Turbo_Sandwich]text=[There needs to be an outright ban on showing images of what we think Norman looks like. 

This isn't Norman to me. But now I will see Norman this way. This post has ruined Norman.

Edit: ok, I spoke hastily. This didn't ruin Norman for me. But I think a large part of what makes Norman so appealing is that we each have our own idea of what he looks like. It makes it personal. 

Besides, I think we can all agree Norman wouldn't be comfortable knowing strangers were sharing his picture on the internet.

As the cashier started to ring Norman up he realized that the woman left behind her wallet. Quickly he retrieved her wallet and called after her. His heart pounding the woman turned around and headed back to him. "Thank you so much" she exclaimed "I don't know what I would have done!" Before Norman could say anything she gave him a quick kiss and was on her way.

Norman blushed as he awoke to the sound of his alarmclock. "Norman, I just had the most unusual and exciting dream!" He proudly told his best friend.

</thread><thread title=[Norman abuses drugs] author=[imakanyemess] text=[Norman laid limp on his couch, rubbing his temples and clenching his eyelids. This headache had been mildly inconviencing him for almost 2 whole hours now, and he was *really* enjoying reading a tutorial on proper garden hedge clipping technique, but even the lowest brightness setting on his Dell laptop aggravated the headache.

Norman decided he had had enough, and needed to get off the couch and take action. A pack of aspirin lay on the counter in the kitchen, and Norman thought it best to read through the instructional leaflet  (after all, someone took the time to write it). He proceeded to take two tablets, as recommended, followed by a slice of conservatively buttered wholemeal toast. 

Half an hour passed, and Norman had felt no effect from the aspirin. This slightly irked him, and in a moment of ruthless impulse, Norman knocked back a third aspirin with a glass of water. An overwhelming feel of instant regret rushed through him as a result of his horribly irresponsible actions, and Norman wondered whether he truly knew himself.

</thread><thread title=[Norman Makes Dinner 28 Times.] author=[DIRCAM] text=[It had been a *long* time since Norman had made dinner.

Well, it had only been 24 hours, for Norman made dinner at 5:45 sharp in the evening, every evening.

But it had been a long time since Norman *truly* made dinner. For the past few weeks he stuck to the usual comfortable routine– a ***Best Choice Microwave Meal.™***

There was comfort in weekly routine, but comfort could also be found in yearly traditions. And after five years of divorce, Norman still hadn't shook one particular tradition from his years of marriage.


The day was April 18th 1988. Norman had sheepishly invited a classmate over for dinner; she quickly accepted. He cooked balsamic-glazed salmon fillets, a quick yet impressive recipe he learned a few weeks ago from a book he found on the floor of the university library.

It went over *very* well– The fish, not the book. (Norman would never go over with a library book, he was steadfast when it came to returning them on time.)

27 years later, Norman still made the Salmon Fillets every April 18th, though he had been without a wife to share it with for five years. He pretended it was in defiance to his ex-wife, a reclaiming of the dish as his own. 

Really, he just feared breaking the yearly routine.

"Wild Asian Ass" the clue read.  He was really stumped and wanted to win because a completed crossword could be returned and entered into a draw for a csi box set.  Suddenly Norman had an idea.  He could Google the clue to get the answer.  He struggled with the morality of cheating before he decided to throw caution to the wind.  

W.. I.. L.. D Norman typed in the letters while frantically looking around the office lest he be caught cheating.  A.. S.. I....... Wait! "Onager!"  Norman remembered the nature documentary with the narrator with the soothing voice.  He deleted his search and walked to the post box after work with his head held high.  

He told Norman all about when he got home.  A few days later after the competition had ended.  Norman rushed to his door to check the post.  And there it was.  His entry,  with return to sender written on it,  in his haste Norman had forgotten a stamp.

Norman is not too disturbed by this, as he has been awake since 6:57 am. But as he lifts his head from the pillow, he feels some throbbing in his temple. His nose is also stuffy. 

"There has been a cold going around the office... better check my temperature".

Norman lets out a small cough as he checks his thermometer. "99 degrees, not good... "

He sits at the foot of his bed and thinks. He took a sick day eight months ago, would it look bad to take another one so soon? Then again, would his coworkers be annoyed by periodic nose blowing?

Norman decides that he should go in. "You never know when you'll need that sick day for something serious."

As Norman walks through his living room, he sees Norman sleeping on the ground. Norman looks up tiredly. "... mew." A small pile of vomit is in the corner.

</thread><thread title=[Norman Gets a Text Message] author=[ButtDialNotBootyCall] text=[It was 2:34am on a Tuesday and Norman was fast asleep in his bed. Suddenly, he was awoken by a sharp "ding" sound that he didn't recognize. Startled, he sat up in bed and looked around the room. He noticed his cell phone glowing as it sat charging on his dresser.

Confused and perturbed, Norman got out of bed and walked across the bedroom to check why his phone had made this noise. As he stumbled towards his phone, he considered using the outlet next to his bedside table in the future. 

When Norman got to his phone, he saw that he had a text message notification. Norman was surprised, because he never gets text messages. He tried to recall when he received his last text message, but couldn't. 

"Who would possibly send me a text message in the middle of the night? Do they know I have to wake up in 4 hours?", Norman asked Norman, who sat squinty eyed on his cat perch in the corner. 

Curiously, and somewhat nervously, he opened the text message. 

"AMBER ALERT - Plate HHG-5509 (PA), White Toyota Camry, 4 Door"

Norman's heart sank, and he felt extreme guilt for questioning the urgency of the text message. Now Norman was wide awake. He began considering his options. He tried to recall CSI episodes of kidnappings. After 5 minutes of consideration, Norman realized he didn't have a enough information to do anything. He laid back in bed and repeated the license plate number in his head so that he could be on the lookout tomorrow. 

Norman didn't get any more sleep that night.

He got out of bed 4 hours later to get ready for work. On his way to work, Norman noticed 5 different white 4-door cars, but didn't believe any to be a Toyota Camry. 

Feeling somewhat disappointed in himself, Norman sat at his computer and opened his web browser, whose homepage is set to the local news station. He read the headline, "Missing girl found". Norman was very relieved, and felt a huge weight off his shoulders. He smiled and thought about how great this day had started.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/494jyt/norman_gets_a_text_message/] createDate=[1457246030] score=[516] numComments=[25]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman lifts something heavy.] author=[PunchMeat] text=[Norman was taking his five minute break at the water cooler again, hoping to strike up a conversation, when Lisa spotted him and called him over.

"I need to move this to the top of my cabinet," she said, indicating a box on her desk.

"I can help with that," said Norman confidently. He was, after all, two inches taller than Lisa.

He took a moment to unbutton his cuffs and neatly roll up his sleeves, then gripped the box handles.

"Careful, it's a bit heavy," said Lisa.

"I'll lift with my legs," Norman assured her, recalling the horror stories in a recent employee safety video.

Norman bent at the knees and lifted. The box was indeed heavy, but not unmanageable. With a quiet grunt, he lifted it over his head and pushed it on top of the cabinet. Then Norman dusted his hands and turned to find that Lisa had been sitting on the edge of her desk, watching him keenly.

"Yes?" he asked.

"Oh! Nothing," she said, almost as breathless as he was.

If there had been a body on the table, the moment would have reminded Norman of a romantic scene he'd recently watched on CSI. "Is there anything else I can help you with?" he asked, his heart racing as he worried he was employing an unacceptable level of double-entendre for the office.

"No," Lisa said with a slight smile. "That was all that I wanted."

The excitement over, Norman tipped an invisible hat and left to return to his desk. He decided he would try for a conversation at the water cooler again tomorrow, and penciled it into his calendar.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/49ozb4/norman_lifts_something_heavy/] createDate=[1457571670] score=[502] numComments=[15]>

Norman closes his eyes, and lets his mind drift to her. Shared laughter, moments of joy, moments of struggle. Norman sifts through it all, happily and sorrowfully. 

Norman winces as a wave of pure desire and longing surge through his body. Norman grabs his headphones, and finds that song he loves, the one she showed him. It reminds him of her presence.

He listens over, and over again. In his mind he's embracing her.

</thread><thread title=[Norman gets mugged] author=[Dotcor_Strangelove] text=[Norman was waiting at the bus stop on his way home from the library.  He was very excited about having found a Dean Koontz novel that he had not yet read.  It was a chilly evening, and the bulb had burnt out above the stop.


A man came up and stood beside him at the bus stop with his hood up.  Norman did not think anything of this, and idly thumbed through the novel in front of him.  He was careful not to crease the pages.  “Library books are not yours, Norman,” his mother had always said. “They belong to everybody.”


The man beside him turned towards him, so Norman looked over and offered a smile.  “Your wallet,” said the man.


Norman was perplexed, and asked him what he meant.


“Your wallet!” The stranger repeated himself. “Give me your wallet, old man!


Norman understood and nodded.  With trembling hands he took his wallet out of his hip pocket.  The man in the hood grabbed it and ran off into the night.  Norman’s heart pounded and his head began to spin.  He hardly even noticed the bus pulling up.


When the driver asked if he was okay, he nodded and paid his fare from the change in his pocket.  As he sat down and the bus pulled away, Norman noticed he had dropped the novel without even realising it and had left it at the stop.

He resolved to call the library first thing in the morning to apologise.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4bgxhp/norman_gets_mugged/] createDate=[1458673036] score=[402] numComments=[19]>

Which is fair, as usually they're written poorly or are just trying to be extreme for the sake of being extreme which is silly but I thought this mugging one was good.

</thread><thread title=[Norman pranks Norman] author=[Bloodsail_Admiral] text=[On March 31st, Norman was shopping at the grocery store, getting his typical things for the week, when he overheard someone talking in the next aisle	 over.


“Dude this prank is going to be hilarious.” Norman heard one person say.


Of course, tomorrow would be the first day of April, and all kinds of hi jinks would ensue! Normally April Fools made Norman queasy, but he was feeling particularly festive this year. He walked over to the cat food aisle and picked out a different brand of cat food than he normally purchased.


Norman could barely contain himself on the drive home.


The following morning Norman got up five minutes early, and went to go feed Norman, after opening the can and pouring the food into the tray, he eyed the door, waiting for his feline friend to appear. After several minutes, Norman arrived, and hopped up onto the table. Norman smirked as Norman sniffed the cat food.


Norman then turned around, and jumped off the table, leaving Norman alone with the cat food.


Norman did not prank Norman again next year.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4cw06b/norman_pranks_norman/] createDate=[1459551145] score=[389] numComments=[7]>

Bad with split-second decisions and feeling nervous, Norman's hands began to feel clammy.  He looked at his coworker and noticed that despite walking at a decent pace he had hardly moved.  Norman blinked.

</thread><thread title=[The Book of Norman- The Time Has(almost) Finally Come/The Writers Who Made the Final Cut] author=[MattressCrane] text=[(If you're interested in hearing some of the progress on the book over the last number of months, feel free to read this overly long speech. If you're here to see who made the cut, and why others did not, skip to the last two paragraphs.)

Hello all! After a long, long while, I'm here with another update. Unfortunately I stated that there was a final update, and that no other update would come after it, which somewhat made me a recluse when it came to sharing information. Most of my info let out was through people specifically asking me, "What the hell are you doing with the book, Cameron!?", and I realize that isn't fair that I made you all have to reach out to me to find out that info. Anyways, I have some news.

The book is finished. Finito. Completo. Donno. Sort of. The innards, all the stories, and all the edits, which there were many, are complete. Frankly, I've had enough stories included in the book since February; that being 365. However, things change. The tone of the book has shifted a lot since the conception of the project, and because of that, stories I collected at the beginning no longer lined up with the thought process I had near the end.

So more stories were collected. Newer, fresher, more in line with what I had in mind. Then, the book shifts again, and I realize there's only so many stories you can have of Norman missing the bus and getting caught in the rain. So I scrapped some repetition.

So more stories were collected. Now, people are starting to write plotlines on the subreddit! Lisa is born! Frank's a drunk! Norman gets some confidence! Ideas that were non-existent start to pop up. "I wish I thought of that earlier" turns into "Damn, I can't *not* put this in the book." So more stories are cut, and more are added. Variety. Levels of skill in writers advance. Some people just disappear and I can't make edits to their story, forcing me to cut. 

So more stories were collected. Now, it's just the best of the crop. Months after finishing, I'll find some damn good stories, better than anything already included. More is cut. More is added. More is cut, yadda yadda.

Then I realized, this will never stop. So long as the subreddit exists, there will be more stories, better stories, than anything written thus far. It evolves. No matter how many rounds of edits I do, re-reading the exact same story two dozen times, there will undoubtedly be typos. I hope not, I did my best, but there will always be grammatical slips, like finding grains of sand in your shoe years later. 

So now, the book is done. It's reached a point where I can be proud of what its become, something that I hope you'll all enjoy. The thing that let's me know it's good, is when I re-read a story, one I've read dozens of times, and known the punchline for a year, but still manage to crack a smile, or even feel a punch in the gut from. It's littered with remarkable talent, fun stories, cute illustrations, and the fine line of boring yet undeniably charming that Norman always had.

This is not the end, and I realize I should stop praising the final product before it even exists. Hell, the whole point of this post here was for one purpose- to show which writers made the cut. I feel that I should post it well ahead of time, since, as this post has hopefully made clear, I had to cut a lot of stories. I felt bad about it. After a while, I had to move the names of the writers away from the stories and number them instead, since some people were so sincere and heartfelt with me, that I just felt horrible removing their stories after I told them it'd be included. If you didn't make the list, know that I am sorry, that it was nothing personal, and it wasn't always because it was better or worse than what made the book. There was a bigger picture involved. Sometimes a fantastic story delves too far from the books set canon, and creates inconsistency with a dozen other stories. Sometimes there will be a story similar to three other stories, but only one of them hits the notes needed for that part of the book. Sometimes, people don't respond to me, and I didn't feel comfortable publishing an altered story. Things get cut.

But it was all for the best; to make this book to be in the best shape it can be, without strings attached. And so, without further ado, here's the list. To those of you included, you'll be receiving a PM shortly. Basically, I'll give you one last chance to see what your story is, if you're interested, and make sure that if I made any changes that you're not fine with, that you can have this last chance to pull out or work it out with me.

Now you ask- how long before it's published? Well, even though the book is finished, all the needed assets are not. I'm still waiting on artists and artwork, so forgive me. I'm very much hoping to have all the pieces finished in the next few weeks. Then, I'm going to order a review copy of the book, and if all is well, I'll publish it! Then, it'll be available for order through Amazon. 

I think a few weeks after that, I'll try and get the e-book version out there as well. One thing at a time. 

As for people asking about pre-orders, know that there won't be anything. I'm a believer that pre-orders are just an excuse for money to be made before people find out whether or not a thing is good. So, buy it once it's out, or even after the early adopters tell you if it's worth the money. It's all still going to charity though, so hopefully you won't feel too out of pocket if you're disappointed with the result, but then again, that's no excuse.

So, let's just see where it goes, okay?] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/52u22t/the_book_of_norman_the_time_hasalmost_finally/] createDate=[1473934185] score=[328] numComments=[42]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman dodges a bullet] author=[VanRolly] text=[As Norman walked out the front door and into the bright sunlight, a tickling sensation arose behind his eyes and in his nose. 

Feeling the oncoming sneeze building quickly in intensity, he reached into the right pocket of his pleated trousers for his handkerchief only to find it missing. 

As the sneeze was about to crest, he frantically patted his hand on his left trouser pocket and then the chest pocket of his short-sleeved button down shirt only to find them empty too except for a button that had come loose from his favourite pair of pants earlier in the week. He had put it in his shirt pocket for safekeeping while at work so he could sew it back on securely once he'd returned home that evening. 

The sudden remembrance of this forgotten task stopped his sneeze in its tracks, and he blinked twice before murmuring to himself "well that was rather too close for comfort."

Norman immediately turned around and went back into the house to retrieve his handkerchief and place the button on his kitchen table for safekeeping until he got home and could sew it back onto his slacks. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4a010e/norman_dodges_a_bullet/] createDate=[1457749595] score=[326] numComments=[20]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman celebrates Father's Day] author=[Cygnus--X1] text=[For Norman, this Sunday was no more eventful than most others, though he had slept in a little longer than usual, snoozing twice instead of once. He had gotten up, showered, had breakfast, read the paper, then did some chores around the house while humming a rather annoying yet catchy song he had had stuck in his head for a few days now.

He was in the middle of doing the dishes when the doorbell rang. Curious, Norman dried off his hands and went to the door. 

"Afternoon sir", the man in the UPS uniform said to him as he handed Norman a small but heavy package. As the delivery man was already on his way back to his van, Norman had just enough time to mutter "Thanks", all the while trying to remember what he'd ordered.

Still racking his brain, Norman put the package on the kitchen table and removed the brown paper around it. "I don't know either, Norman", he told his cat that was looking at him quizzically.

In the package were three dark bottles of ale, centered around a big beer mug. There was plastic wrapping around it, with a little bow lint on top. Attached to it was a card. Norman opened it.

**"Happy Father's Day, Dad! :) X Norm Jr. &amp; Jess"**

For what seemed like minutes, Norman couldn't move. He kept staring at the bottles, and felt a tear well up in his eye. He wanted to say something, anything, to Norman the cat or to himself or to no one in particular, but his throat was swollen.

That night, Norman drank two of the bottles from the beer mug. He didn't usually like ale, and these specific brews were sour and watery, but he drank them all the same and loved every swig of it.

When he lay in bed that night, he didn't know if his head was swarming from the beers or the happiness he felt.

</thread><thread title=[Norman rebels.] author=[Ibex89] text=[It was 9:16 a.m. and Norman was sitting on a lightly padded chair in the office kitchen at work. His manager was giving a presentation. As the stream of words drifted through the room, Norman began to notice that he felt rather tired. Odd, since he’d gotten his usual eight hours of sleep, and had drunk the same warm cup of coffee with cream that he always drank. A friendly bank teller had persuaded him yesterday to have a piece of hard candy, and he wondered sleepily if that could be the root of his lethargy. He’d read somewhere that too much sugar can affect sleep quality.

After a short time, Norman noticed that he was having trouble focusing on his manager’s presentation, having missed the last few sentences. What’s more, Norman felt a yawn coming on. Now, Norman is not usually one to draw attention to himself, especially in such a professional atmosphere. He started to become worried – what if his manager thought that Norman was not engaged with the presentation? Norman did not want to consider the ramifications of such a thought, and though he feared making a scene, the urge to yawn was creeping slowly but steadily through his body.

Then a strange and new thought occurred to Norman. He realized that he really WASN’T engaged in the presentation. He WAS rather bored by his manager today. Perhaps, Norman thought, I AM willing to shake things up a little, and give a good yawn. Nothing big, nothing flashy, just a nice, satisfying yawn.

As Norman considered it, he liked the idea more and more. He sat up and prepared himself for his act of rebellion. By this time, however, he found that he was much too excited, and the urge to yawn had left him entirely.

No more candy for me, Norman thought. It makes me kind of wild.

He listened attentively to the last three minutes of the presentation.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4gw7qn/norman_rebels/] createDate=[1461907653] score=[317] numComments=[9]>

Norman looked around the room to see if other objects in there could jog his memory when suddenly his eyes laid upon the water fountain. 

"Perhaps I came in here to grab some water?" Norman asked nobody in particular. "No that can't be, because I am not thirsty." He reassured himself.

Norman realized that whatever it was that he came in here for must have probably not been very important and decided it was probably best to set this mystery aside for anther time. Perhaps he would remember it later on as he continued on his work. 

Norman walked back to his desk and took a seat when suddenly it popped into his head like a light bulb. *ohhhh* Norman thought. He *did* go in there for some water. Norman considered getting back up but realized he had already wasted too much company time as it was. "I am thirsty," Norman said to himself, "but not THAT thirsty."] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/49vgrx/norman_forgets_why_he_entered_a_room/] createDate=[1457672545] score=[308] numComments=[8]>

<comment number=[3]author=[HydrA-]text=[Isn't there a story of Norman going to the bathroom, similar to this? Ah yes, here it is

&gt;It was the middle of the afternoon, and Norman got up from his desk to go make some copies. After walking for a minute, he suddenly realized he'd absentmindedly turned down the hallway towards the bathroom instead of the one towards the copy room. There were other people walking around the office, and Norman didn't want to look foolish by just turning around in the middle of the hallway. So Norman kept going and walked into the bathroom. There were also other people in the bathroom, so Norman walked to the sink and rinsed his hands for a second so that it would look like he'd had a reason for coming in. Then he left the bathroom and headed to the copy room.
As he made his copies, Norman thought to himself that he'd have to pay more attention to where he was walking next time.

And the fact he had nothing planned for the evening.

Not even CSI.

There's only so much CSI you can watch. He knew he'd have to leave it for at least a few months before he could repeat binge the latest series. He had enjoyed the binge but it played havoc with his schedules. He preferred the drip-feed of regular television. Now he had the power to choose his viewing schedule.

He didn't need that kind of responsibility.    
&amp;nbsp;
He had been thinking about the game 'No Man's Sky'. Norman didn't own a playstation or any other console, apart from his PC. A lot of people had said that the gameplay was very repetitive.

This was something Norman was good at.

<comment number=[29]author=[potentialPizza]text=[That site is filled with fallacious arguments.

&gt;Gin is not a good counterexample because it’s a drink derived from juniper berries, so its name is from the Dutch jenever for “juniper”. Gem comes from the Latin gemma for “jewel”. As for the other words, they are abbreviations of larger words, so they inherited their pronunciations.

What the hell? So having a root from another language means that it doesn't count? The words with hard g's that the site lists have roots too. And how is it relevant that the other words (Gym, Geo, and Gel) are abbreviations of longer words? They're still completely valid examples of the soft G.

&gt;It’s the most natural, logical way to pronounce it. That’s why when everyone comes across the word for the first time, they use a hard G.

What a totally objective statement! I'm sure nobody has a different experience!

&gt;The creator of the GIF image format, Steve Wilhite of CompuServe, when deciding on the pronunciation, said he deliberately chose to echo the American peanut butter brand, Jif, and CompuServe employees would often say “Choosy developers choose GIF(jif)”, playing off of Jif’s television commercials. If you hear anyone pronounce GIF with a soft G, it’s because they know something of this history.

Oh! I didn't know the story that I'd never heard of was why I instinctively pronounced it with a soft g the first time I saw it! Gee, the creator of this website sure knows a lot about me!

&gt;Speaking of Steve Wilhite, when he explains the pronunciation of GIF, he himself has to explicitly write, “It’s pronounced ‘JIF’.” He has to explain it this way because it goes against how it would naturally be pronounced.

No, he has to explain it because it's a well-known, divisive controversy.

I really don't care how people pronounce it, but I have a problem with the condescending, illogical arguments that site uses.]score=[5] </comment>

</thread><thread title=[Norman is Named] author=[MattressCrane] text=[Norman put down the cage on the kitchen counter. Inside, a little kitten meowed actively, eager to get out.

"Hold your horses, little kitten!" Norman said to himself. Norman then giggled at the joke he had just made.

Norman couldn't wait to let the little cat out of the cage. But he knew he couldn't- it would feel like he was opening someone else's gift. It would be opening someone else's gift. Norman sneaked little treats through the bars of the cage, until finally Norman Jr came home from school.

"Hey Junior, are you ready for your birthday present?" Norman announced gleefully. Norman Jr was still busy taking off his shoes when Norman shouted. The little boy tossed his bag into the air, happily running into the kitchen.

"What is it what is it what is it!" He shouted, jumping up and down. Norman took the cage off the counter, lowered it to the floor, and cracked open the door handle.

Norman Jr was ecstatic! The boy grabbed the kitten up, embraced him in his arms, and gave the feline creature a gentle, loving hug.

"This kitten is no toy," Norman lectured, "it's a living thing. Are you willing to have it be your responsibility from now on?"

"Yes daddy I am! I swear, I'll feed it, I'll water it, I'll take it for walks-"

"I believe you!" Norman cried. Norman Jr placed the kitten carefully down on the floor; watching it waddle and explore the room. Then, Norman Jr jumped to his father, giving him a big hug, the strongest, tightest bear hug he could manage.

"What are you going to name it?" Norman asked his son.

Norman Jr thought carefully. He scratched his head, then a smile came onto his face.
"Norman," the boy said surely.

"You're naming the cat after yourself? That's a little funny, don't ya think?"

"I'm naming it after you, dad. So you'll always be with me."

Later that night, as Norman brushed his teeth, he started to cry. He was proud.

He smiled, wondering who would be texting him this afternoon. He set down the rag and reached his hand into his right pocket, only to find the phone was not there. The text message had been a figment of his wandering imagination.

This led Norman to wonder, *"Where is my phone?"*, as it wasn't in his pocket. He began searching all of the usual spots, the bathroom, the car, the dining room, even under the cat napping on the bookshelf. 

He chuckled to himself upon discovering that the phone had been in his left hand the entire time. He thought of a joke about it being "handy" to find his phone there, though sighed when he had no one around to share his humor with.

</thread><thread title=[Norman gets his wallet back] author=[PayMyTrollToll] text=[Norman just arrived home from work after a very stressful week.   Norman sat down with Norman to watch a rerun of CSI,  wondering if next week his luck would turn around.  

Just as the opening credits to CSI began,  a loud and determined knock at the door startled Norman and Norman.  "Who could that be?"  Norman thought to himself.   Norman stood up from the couch and walked towards the front door. 

Norman opened the door and to much surprise a police officer was standing on his porch.  "Good evening sir,  is your name Norman?"  asked the officer.  A quick wave of mixed emotions washed over Norman,  frantically thinking what wrongdoing Norman could have possibly done to summon a police officer to his door.

Norman quickly replied "Yes,  I'm Norman".  The officer asked Norman if he was the victim of a mugging this week,  and if his wallet had been stolen.  Norman told the officer about his mugging incident at the bus stop earlier this week.  Before Norman could finish his recount of that night,  the officer pulled Norman's wallet out of a brown paper bag marked "evidence". 

The officer explained to Norman he found the wallet on a man he arrested earlier in the week.  The officer explained to Norman since it was a misdemeanor crime not committed in his presence,  he was unable to charge this man with a crime unless Norman was willing to make a citizens arrest. 

"An arrest?!" Norman thought to himself.  Just like on CSI...  But Norman had never pictured himself taking such heroic action.  Norman quickly contemplated whether or not he should let this criminal go.  "Stealing" Norman thought to himself.  Norman knew he could not let this slide.  "I'll do it officer.   I'll make the arrest,  where is he?!" 

The officer handed Norman a piece of paper titled "citizens arrest form"  and explained to Norman all he had to do was sign it and the charges will be filed.  Norman signed the form and the officer returned his wallet to him. 

Norman returned to the couch with Norman,  with a feeling of relief and joy that justice was served and his wallet returned to him.  Norman chuckled to himself "imagine me,  making an arrest".] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4bj29u/norman_gets_his_wallet_back/] createDate=[1458705016] score=[261] numComments=[23]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman has a Disagreement with a Coworker] author=[MattressCrane] text=[Norman sighed as he spoke with June from sales.

A few minutes earlier, Norman stepped into the break room to hear June talking with another coworker. They were talking about their kids, and June specifically wanted to talk about the new vegan diet her family was partaking on.

"Jenny's only three," started June, "but she's loving her steamed broccoli dinners. She doesn't even miss all the sweets she used to have. Believe me."

The other coworker found an exit opportunity from the conversation when Norman entered the room.

"Hey Norman," he said, "do you have any kids?"

Norman enthusiastically told the two about Junior, his son who, despite all the lovely things Norman had to say, hasn't spoken with his father in over six months.

"Did you feed Junior sugar when he was a baby?" June asked. The coworker took the chance to flee the room.

"Yes, lots! He could be so noisy, and cry *so* much, but nothing a pop-tart couldn't fix!"

Norman regretted his statement. June spent the next twenty minutes prodding Norman and letting him know all the mistakes he made raising Junior.

</thread><thread title=[Norman finds a good deal.] author=[[deleted]] text=[It was Saturday morning and Norman needed to get Norman some cat food from the store. The weather was warm and dry and Norman thought it might be nice to walk. 
At the store, Norman was quite pleased to find that Norman’s favourite cat food was on special offer. He read the offer very carefully:

“Buy One Get One Free. All marked varieties. Offer cannot be used in conjunction with any other offer.”

It seemed like a very good offer indeed. 

Norman gave some careful thought to what he should do. He didn’t want to spoil Norman and, where would he store all of the extra cat food?

Norman realised that if he didn’t take advantage of the offer, he would have to choose another cat food. He wanted to avoid any awkwardness at the checkout. 
 
Norman decided that he could probably find room for the extra cat food and he should buy it. After all, it would save him another trip to the store next weekend. 

Then Norman remembered that he had walked to the store on that day and he would not be able to carry all of that cat food home by himself. 

Disappointed, Norman selected Norman’s second favourite brand and headed to the checkout. He decided not to tell Norman about this when he got home.

</thread><thread title=[Norman Keeps the Change] author=[CitizenPremier] text=[Every Tuesday at work, Norman would buy a bag of Cheez-its from the vending machine.  He would always make sure in the morning that he had a dollar and a quarter, so he would have the exact amount for the purchase.  But he would also always check the change slot, as a matter of habit.  Today when he bought his Cheez-its, he reached in the slot and found, to his surprise, fifty cents.  At first he was excited.  He put it into the change pocket in his wallet and walked excitedly back to his desk to eat lunch.  He poured the Cheez-its onto his plate and took the first bite of his sandwich, but as he did, he felt a wave of anxiety.  What if someone went back to the machine to get their change?  They might need the fifty cents.  They might even come over to Norman's desk to ask him for it, if they noticed his snacking habits.  Norman took the fifty cents and put it on the most visible corner of his desk, so that everyone could see it and know he wasn't trying to be a thief.

Norman looked up from his computer screen and scanned the office, noting a couple of empty desks. Some people really do love to clock off early, he thought to himself. 

Just as he refocused on his meticulously ordered spreadsheet, his boss walked around the corner and headed straight for him. 

"Norman, really solid effort this week, I've given everyone permission to start their weekends that hour earlier, you should go home and make the most of the nice weather." His boss chimed happily. 

"It's okay, I would like to finish this spreadsheet, and I promised Tom I would proof read his last proposal before Monday meetings."

"Suit yourself, have a good weekend" he replied. 

Norman smiled to himself, a solid effort and the offer to go home earlier. He must be making quite the difference he thought.

"Welcome to the mood study. My name is Carol and I'm going to be seeing you for the next year as part of the clinical trial. I'd like to thank you again for signing up to be a part of the study, Norman. I'd just li-".

"Actually," Norman Junior interjected, "could you just call me Norm? My old man's name is Norman". The tone in his voice told Carol exactly where she should pick up.

"Of course, Norm." Carol finished her explanation of the study from where Norm had interrupted before moving on. "You sound like there's something going on with your father. Could we start there with the mood survey?"

"Sure." Norm composed himself a bit before continuing. "I just told my Dad-uh, Norman that I gave his Convocation ticket to my step-Dad, Randy. I'm torn up about it, I guess." 

The staccato stabs of impossibly long nails on a mechanical keyboard stopped. "Hmm. What's your relationship like with your biological father?"

Norm had been thinking about that since he got off the phone with Norman. He had wanted to talk to his Dad more but his asshole roommate Steve was about to try to open a bottle with his teeth and Norm inevitably would be the one cleaning up the blood.

"I guess...he's not a bad dude, really. Kinda boring. Works at some office. As a kid he always told me to wear a helmet while riding my bike and to stay safe. He sometimes listens to polkas, for Christ's sake-" Norm punctuated his comment with an awkward chuckle. "Always wanted to make a model train set with me, but my Mom left to be with Randy and she told me about how cool he was and how I should live with her and Randy and we never got the chance. I'd almost want to do it now, just to see what Dad's up to."

Those stilleto nails summoned a box of Kleenex from a drawer as if they had read Norm's mind. "You take your time", Carol's voice was emotional aloe vera. 

"Randy was all about wild shit," Norm tried and failed to hide his contempt. "Big pecs, drank everyone under the table, screamed at the television with his buddies and went to the gym constantly. That shit gets tired, y'know?"

The hour with Carol melted under the weight of Norm's guilt. Carol swabbed his cheek and gave him a lab requisition for bloodwork. As he booked his next appointment Norm was already looking forward to following Carol's advice.

Later, at home, Norm tried to write a letter. He got as far as "Dear Dad" before his hand started trembling.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4lqip7/norman_jr_talks_about_norman/] createDate=[1464657175] score=[220] numComments=[8]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Gets Cancer] author=[mcmonsoon] text=[Norman woke up Tuesday morning with a strange, sharp pain in his left arm. He wasn't sure how this new pain came about, but he ruled out it being a result of a poor sleeping position. Norman always slept flat on his back with his arms at his side and he doesn't move the entire night. It had to be something else, he thought.

He sat at the edge of his bed preparing to dismount. His sleep-stiff body eventually creaked its way to the kitchen to make some coffee, but he stopped off at the den to use the computer first.

"G-O-O-G-L-E- Dot com," he typed with a single index finger into the address bar. "Pain in left arm causes"

 *Search.* 

The results were numerous. Most of the sites linked to pain medications and therapeutic heat pads, but the one that stuck out to Norman was some sort of internet hospital called "Web MD"  and according to the symptoms presented by this digital health professional, it was cancer.

Norman froze. He stood up and, like a zombie, walked to the bathroom to look at himself in the mirror.

"I have... arm cancer," Norman croaked. The color drained from his face and he stared, glossy eyed at his own reflection.


He picked his cat Norman up off of the floor and they curled up together in bed.


"Thanks for staying with me through all this, Norman."

</thread><thread title=[Norman likes cheap whisky] author=[Odysseus32] text=[Norman always did love fall. He couldn't quite put his finger on it, but it just felt right. The leaves changing were nice, and he loved a nice college football game, but the air just felt a tad bit different when late September came around. 

Kroger was particularly packed on Thursday evening, something Norman wasn't a fan of, but he was pressed to get a couple special ingredients for his dinner. He was having bow tie pasta that required basil pesto as well as parsley. The parsley was optional but if he was going to follow a recipe he was going to do it right. 

Norman made his way through the crowd and quickly grabbed his items. Taking the shortest possible route to the registers, Norman noticed the whisky aisle to his right. 

"I haven't had a good drink in......well over a year now." Norman thought to himself as he perused the shelf. 

"Why not!" Thought Norman as he bent down to grab a bottle of Evan Williams. Norman wanted to enjoy a drink, but he wasn't going to spend a lot of money. This was the alcohol Norman would drink every couple of weeks in college when he and his cousin would stay up late discussing philosophy. Norman knew it didn't have the best reputation, but to him it was all the same. 

As Norman got home, he quickly poured himself a small tumbler of Whisky as he started cooking.  After pouring he held the bottle at eye level to really examine it. 100 proof. 50% alcohol. With Norman's tolerance and love for all things in moderation, this bottle could last him for an extremely long time. 

As he sat down to tune into CSI for the evening, the alcohol had certainly hit him. Leaning back on the couch after cleaning up, with his dinner cooling off in the other room he gently stroked Norman's head. 

"This is nice. Nothing wrong with a drink every now and then is there buddy?" Norman said to Norman as he unintentionally drifted to sleep.

</thread><thread title=[Norman discovers /r/lifeofnorman] author=[RedLegionnaire] text=[It was another typical Saturday afternoon when Norman was snapped out of his placid daydreaming by the shrill tone of the Nokia theme, emanating from his cell phone.

Now, it was newer phone, but he had liked how cool and important the somewhat aggressive ringtone made him feel, so he had his son, who was a real tech wiz "hack" his current phone to have the jarring, descending melody.

Norman was excited, not only by the pulse pumping tune, but by the prospect of an unexpected phone call. He flipped the small, simple device open and uttered "H-hello?"

"Uh... hello. Norman, ehem, this is Lisa, from work..."

Norman's heart raced, was there some sort of work emergency that only he was capable of resolving? He wasn't sure he could handle the pressure. 

"I, uh... I saw something weird the other day on lunch break," Lisa confessed.

Norman relaxed slightly, but still, his mind raced as to what could possibly have been so important as to reach out to him on the weekend. "Oh, what's that?" He inquired.

"Look, I'll just send you a link, I still have your personal email." 

Norman thought for a moment, but then recalled that they had exchanged emails when they both were among those chosen at the office to arrange the holiday party; Norman was still proud of the rousing and bawdy event he had a hand in creating. There was still a punch stain on the floor by Johnson's desk!

"Just, please, give it a look. I'm sorry, I have to go" Lisa said with increasing cadence, before hanging up abruptly.

Norman assumed she must have had something important to tend to on her end, perhaps laundry. But he now had task in mind, and walked to the spare room where his reliable Dell sat, fans humming, the soft glow of it's indicator lights making the room feel less like a home office and more like a discotheque. He booted it up and got to work.
His home screen popped up; it was still unfamiliar to him, his son had installed something he called a "browser" last time he was over, even though Norman told him he was fine with just the "internet." He kind of missed clicking on the familiar blue "e". 

Norman typed "google" into the google search bar, and clicked "search." He still hadn't worked up the bravado to attempt "i'm feeling lucky."

The google page loaded dutifully, and Norman promptly typed AOL as his query, clicking the "search" button, careful to avoid the "lucky" button, once again.

He carefully observed the links, and found the AOL link his son had advised him about, something about the top most links being ads. He hoped he had clicked the right one.

"You've got mail!" the computer chimed.

"Success!" Norman thought to himself.

He combed through his new emails, there were seven. He started by clicking the oldest one, he didn't want to be rude to whoever sent it, and make them wait.

"Cheap RX Canadian warehouse pharma megadeals," Norman read, he opened the email and began to read. It was typical medical jargon he was sure was beyond his paygrade, but on the off chance they might have something cheap to take care of Norman's hairballs, he clicked the embedded link. The computer thought and thought, but nothing came up. Suddenly he remembered his curiosity had him on a mission - he eyed the remaining emails until he saw Lisa's username. The subject line simply said "lifeofnorman."

Norman opened the email. It contained only a single link, "www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman."
His curiosity was fully in control now, and he hovered his cursor over the link, when a shrill dinging came over the speakers. 

"Ding ding ding; Threat has been detected!"

Norman panicked, as he broke into a cold sweat. Was someone trying to hack him? He quickly and instinctively deleted Lisa's email, and exited the browser. For good measure, he turned off his computer and unplugged it as well. 

He'd have to check on those discount prescriptions another time.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5sm6wg/norman_discovers_rlifeofnorman/] createDate=[1486512188] score=[210] numComments=[18]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman has had enough.] author=[kaebal] text=[Norman sat at his desk at work, his eyes on the paperwork laid out before him, but his mind elsewhere. A mint chocolate cupcake was waiting for him in the office refrigerator. Norman didn't usually indulge in sweets like this, but yesterday had been his birthday. Allison, from HR, liked to keep track of everyone's birthday and always made sure to bring in cupcakes or even a full sized cake when someone in the office was working on their birthday.  
  
*An easy oversight to make*, Norman thought, as Allison hadn't brought in anything yesterday. *She is probably overworked as well.*  
  
After work last night Norman had walked to a cupcake shop that had been a bit out of his way. He was not fond of mint chocolate, and was hoping to get a plain vanilla with vanilla frosting, but the mint chocolate was all they had left. He decided he would save it for after his lunch at work the next day.
  
*Perhaps I should eat it now, in case someone mistakes it for their own cupcake.* It was only 11:15am and Norman knew it was unlikely that anyone would eat his cupcake, but he worried about it nonetheless. *I better just be done with it so I can focus on my work.*
  
Norman walked to the break room and retrieved his treat. It was a bit smooshed as Norman had to hide it in his coat to protect it as it started to rain on his walk home last night. Eating it reminded him of how little he cared for mint chocolate, but he was committed to enjoying this rare sweet.
  
“Happy Birthday!” Allison shouted as Norman returned to his desk, startling him. She was carrying a tray of vanilla cupcakes. “You’d thought I'd forgotten, didn't you Jim?” She said as she placed the tray down on Jim's desk. “Come on everyone, get a cupcake and wish Jim a happy birthday!” Allison announced to the office. Jim looked pleased.
  
Norman was glad that Allison had remembered Jim’s birthday, and the cupcakes did look good to Norman. *Better not*, he thought, as he sat back down to his paperwork. *I've had enough.*

</thread><thread title=[Norman tries Thai food] author=[USMC0317] text=[Around 4:00 PM Norman had a sudden realization that he had forgot to stock up on microwave dinners last time he was at the grocery store. Even though it was Friday, and it had been a pretty slow, uneventful day so far, Norman wouldn't be getting off work for another hour, and he certainly couldn't leave early. "I'll have plenty of time to stop at the store on the way home" Norman thought. He didn't want to miss his favorite Friday night TV show, which came on at precisely 6:00 PM. He sat at his desk pondering what he wanted for dinner tonight until it was finally time to leave and head to the store. As he was perusing the meals in the frozen section, he spotted an Amy's Kitchen Chicken Pad Thai. Feeling adventurous, he opened the glass door and removed the box from the freezer. He thought to himself "you've had a long week, you deserve to reward yourself." He turned the box over to check the nutritional information, which is when he noticed how much sodium was in the pad Thai. "Better play it safe" he thought, as he put the box back in the freezer, and grabbed his usual Lean Cuisine meatloaf. He made it home at 5:58 PM, just in time to settle in for his favorite show. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4abk3k/norman_tries_thai_food/] createDate=[1457956363] score=[203] numComments=[19]>

</thread><thread title=[The Joke] author=[lordperiwinkle] text=[Norman was in the supply closet at work, door ajar.  He was getting a new pen.  Just as he was about to leave he heard footsteps and voices.  The footsteps stopped near the partly open closet door.  His co-workers.  "Hey, I have a great joke for you!" said a hearty voice.   Craig.  Norman was not sure about Craig.  He always seemed so...*satisfied* with himself.  Norman wondered what always being satisfied with one's self felt like.  A couple of the women in the office certainly liked Craig.  Craig, with his crisp, curly hair, and his fast walk, and his hearty, cheerful, deep voice.  Norman sank back further into the shadowy closet, listening, waiting for his co-workers to return to their cubicles.  Craig launched into his joke. It was one of those long ones with much build up.  His co-workers were snorting bits of laughter even before it was finished.  The punch line came.  Much laughter, snickering, guffawing, giggling ensued.    Norman did not get the joke.  "ah, that was great!" said one. "Hey! Make sure you tell Norman!  He could use a good laugh!" said Julie.  Norman was fond of Julie.  She never treated him as if he was a non-entity.  "Aw, I don't know...does Norman even understand jokes? He doesn't seem the joking kind", said Craig.  "Just tell him." said Julie.

After they left, Norman hurried back to his desk, unnoticed.  In a bit, Craig approached.  While he was regaling Norman with the joke Norman worked at making a smile play around his lips, and burst into a laugh at the end.  "Oh!  That is Funny!" grinned Norman.  "I can hardly wait until tonight, when I can tell this to my best friend!"   "You have a best friend??" inquired Craig, somewhat amazed.  "Oh, yeah, he lives in my neighborhood", Norman replied.  "I've known him almost his whole life." Craig went away and Norman wondered why others thought the joke was so funny.  "I don't get it" sighed Norman to himself.

 That evening after Norman was home from work and his Hungry Man dinner was cooking in the oven, Norman told Norman about the joke.  He scratched Norman's silky ears and rubbed his soft cheek with his knuckle.  Norman told the joke, trying hard to give the same inflections that Craig had.  At the end Norman blinked his large green cat eyes at Norman, and tilted his head, pondering.  He did not get the joke, either.

<comment number=[11]author=[HansBrixOhNo]text=["No soap radio" is a form of practical joke and an example of surreal comedy. The joke is in reality a prank whereby the punch line has no relation to the body of the joke – that is, it is actually not funny – but participants in the prank pretend otherwise. The effect is to either trick someone unfamiliar with the prank into laughing along as if he or she "gets it" and/or ridicule him or her for not understanding.

<comment number=[12]author=[Rug_Rider]text=[I'm fond of the Norman not understanding the joke. Have you considered pointing out Norman's thought process in staying in the closet? For instance not wanting to be rude and interrupting the joke or internal quarreling for if it's too late to come out? It just appears as if he's sorta awkward/creepy to slink back into the closet. I think it was a nice touch to have him repeat the joke to Normal, aka his best friend. V cute]score=[2] </comment>
<comment number=[13]author=[lordperiwinkle]text=[I thought the staying in the closet bit showed how socially awkward he is.  He feels a bit intimidated by Craig, and did not want to pop out like he had been lurking.  Better he should wait for them to move on.  Not creepy, just shy.  I sort of think I write stuff that is too wordy so I tried to keep this shorter.  I was glad that he was able to tell Craig he had a best friend and let Craig think it was a human.  The idea for this popped into my head and it wrote itself, pretty much.  Thanks for liking it.]score=[5] </comment>

She had not been easy, her secret, inner workings teasing and frustrating in equal measure. And now it was nearly time. 

Norman leaned back in the metal folding chair, taking a slow deep breath. He could feel the hairs on the back of his neck bristle and a bead of cold sweat run down the small of his back. Willing his hand to stop shaking, Norman tried to calm his nerves. All this time, all this effort, all of Norman's pride came down to this one moment. 

Taking up the tweezers, Norman gingerly attached the minuscule  Ship's Bell to the mainmast of the 1:146 scale model of the U.S.S. Constitution. She was beautiful. Standing up from the his desk, Norman carefully picked up the model and walked across his study to place on the shelf with the other models. 

Later that evening, Norman got up from his recliner during a commercial break of an episode of CSI to fetch another mug of decaffeinated tea from the kettle. On his way, he stuck his head through the doorway of the study, admiring the model for the third time in the last hour. Norman smiled at the thrill of pride inside of him.

With each passing hour, he drank less, but after a few puppies passed gas he hadn't eaten anymore. Suddenly Norman saw Norman and said, "Tough Life".  Norman laughed moderately. Afterwards he licked his wounds.

The day was nice but humid. Unfortunately, nothing exciting happened. Except that afterward, Norman eliminated the constant headache that killed his productivity. Then, after waiting for hours, Norman looked like a new man.]score=[79] </comment>

<comment number=[32]author=[MattressCrane]text=[So! I can't respond to everyone, so I'll just write it here. Lots of good feedback. I'm glad I did this, because I was leaning more towards the second; the 2001 reference, if I were to pick from the list. However, from the statistics from the comments here, 0% of you agreed with me. So maybe it's for the best that I don't choose that one!

I think my decision is now this: None of the above!

The third one was one I was working on for a December month; which is a very gloomy one. However, I found a more talented artist to fill the boots for that one, so I scrapped my attempt; then thought about moving it over here. But it doesn't quite match the tone of the month of April either. So, not that one.

While I like the first one, and a lot of you too, but the problem with it is the colours. Chances are the book will have the images in black and white, and because of that, the first image does not transition well to a dulled canvas. So not that either.

I think, for April and for January, I'll lean towards minimalism and cartoonish style for Norman. While there is already 10 other images done, all in different styles, I do realize that none of the styles are quite... Dilberty, if you get what I mean. I'll see if I can get that done. ]score=[1] </comment>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Robs a Bank] author=[gumzilla] text=[Norman awoke feeling anxious. He had never done what he was about to do, but something unnatural came over him. Norman was ready to finally live life on the edge.                 

He pulled up to First National Bank and began walking towards the front doors. "It's now or never," mumbled Norman as he grabbed the door handle with his sweaty palm.                                                                
Norman got in line and pulled out the folded note from his pocket as he waited for the next available teller.                                                          
"Next." 

Norman cautiously approached the teller's window and slid the note, complete with his clear written  instructions, into her hands.

"I would like to withdrawal twenty dollars from Savings Account Number: 12816802, please."                                                
Norman knew he should keep that money in savings, but thought it was time to live a little.

"Maybe I could get another two cans of Coke," Norman thought.
          
The bank teller counted out the money and handed it to Norman. "Thank you for choosing First National, have a great day."

Norman folded the money into his pocket and walked towards his car. As Norman was sitting in the passenger seat he counted the money himself.

Norman counted twenty-one dollars. A sudden urge of guilt and worry swept over Norman. "Bank robbers end up in jail," Norman thought.                                                  
Norman hurried back into the bank and returned to the teller to tell her of the awful mistake. "I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to take the extra dollar," Norman remarked as he handed her the money.                         
The teller counted the money aloud once more. "One, two, three....twenty dollars. Sir, it's all here."

Norman became perplexed as he realized it was actually him who counted incorrectly.
                      
"Uh, uh it's okay, no withdrawl for me today," Norman blurted out as he turned and walked hurriedly towards the exit.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4iwqsm/norman_robs_a_bank/] createDate=[1463024847] score=[190] numComments=[16]>

Norman reached out and caught it between his thumb and forefinger. He carried it for a block or so and then gently let it drop on the sidewalk near some other leaves. The fallen leaves would eventually turn brown and make a satisfying crunching sound when he stepped on them.

When he heard of a great market in a town nearby, he excitedly got into his car on a sunny afternoon. 

It was a little nerve-wracking to go to a new place. It helped that the just right amount of breeze was coming through his window, and the sun wasn't burning his skin, it was actually the perfect amount of sunlight. It calmed his nerves as he continued to drive. 

After a bit of driving, he passed a sign, it had his name on it! His heart skipped a beat, not expecting to have to go through a town named "Norman," as that was his name too. He had a good chuckle after he passed the town, it was a nice and funny feeling to see such a quaint town with such a good name.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4jiobe/norman_goes_through_norman/] createDate=[1463385511] score=[190] numComments=[8]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman experiments with chemical substances] author=[missmaggy2u] text=[Norman was watching a special on television. It was one of those health documentaries, one that warns of the risks of addictive substances. The chemicals, the questionable additives, and even how they can lead to a changed lifestyle and the endless health risks. 

Yet, seeing them on his modest television set seemed to spark a craving he had long since buried. He began to think back to his younger days, when he occasionally dabbled in such things. 

Of course back then he was younger, more resistant. Whatever he felt, he could usually bounce back. And things weren't as bad for you back then, so they thought. Could his body handle these things as easily as it once did?

The craving began to become overwhelming, getting worse the more he thought about it. He knew where to get it. Every teenager did. The corner of Park and Wells, they had it cheap. 

When he returned home, there was no hesitation. Only devious excitement. He nearly burned himself.

Slightly startled, he glanced sleepily over at his bedside table and saw the faint glow of his phone screen, which was lying facedown atop an old TV guide.  A small wave of excitement rippled through him as he realized "I've just gotten a text!"  As he reached for his slightly outdated (but functional) windows phone, he wondered, "But who could be messaging me at this hour?"  Turning his phone over, he was blinded by a flash of light, as he had once again neglected to turn down the brightness of the screen before going to bed.  "They ought to fix that somehow" he said softly to no one in particular as he darkened the screen and typed "1234", unlocking the phone.  For a moment he forgot what he was doing, and while he was thinking, his phone buzzed again. Truly excited now, he checked his messages to find that it was only his wireless company reminding him that his bill was due in a week.

</thread><thread title=[Norman goes to an all-you-can-eat buffet] author=[tanzabonanza] text=[Norman was driving home from work one dreary Thursday afternoon when a neon sign he hadn't seen before flashed in the distance. As he got closer, he saw that the new restaurant they'd been building near Wal-Mart had finally opened. The sign advertised an all-you-can-eat buffet on Friday and Saturday nights. As usual, Norman didn't have any weekend plans so he thought maybe he would stop for dinner after work tomorrow. He'd never been to an all-you-can-eat buffet before. 

The next day at work, Norman spent his lunch break looking at the website for the restaurant. There was a list of all the foods included on the buffet and Norman carefully wrote down exactly what foods he wanted to get on each trip. He planned on pacing himself so he didn't get too stuffed and tired. He had two episodes of CSI recorded that he planned on watching when he got home. 

Finally, it was time! Norman got in his car and drove to the restaurant. He arrived at 5:15, and as it was still early in the evening, he was seated immediately. A young blonde waitress arrived to take his order. She let him know that the special that night was the all-you-can-eat buffet and that it was $14.99. Norman ordered an Arnold Palmer to drink since it was the weekend and told the  waitress he would have the buffet. She smiled and told him to go ahead and grab a plate from the stack and enjoy his dinner. 

He shuffled up to the buffet line and grabbed a plate. He consulted the note in his pocket detailing what food items to get. His first course was to be a salad. He piled on a small mound of iceberg lettuce, some cheddar cheese, and tomatoes. In another corner he added a small scoop of cole slaw. He wanted ranch dressing but he didn't see any and didn't want to be a bother, so he ladled on French instead. He found a cup for soup and poured himself a small bowl of chicken noodle. That would do for the first round. Nothing too filling right away. He made his way back to the table and sipped his beverage and began eating. 

Norman polished off the salad and cole slaw before eating the soup. He realized he had erred when his soup was just luke warm, but reasoned that he could always grab more on another trip. 

The smiling blonde waitress stopped by to ask how everything was and ask if she could take his plate out of the way. Norman froze. His eyes darted around at the other tables, but there weren't many to look at. As this was his first trip to an all-you-can-eat buffet, he wasn't sure if he was supposed to use the same plate or get a new one. He replied that he wasn't quite finished and that he would keep his plate for now. The waitress left the table. 

Nobody close by was having the buffet. Norman didn't want to look silly and do the wrong thing with his plate. He sipped his Arnold Palmer slowly. The waitress stopped by a few minutes later and asked if Norman was doing okay. He asked for the check. 

He paid his $18 tab and left an even 15% tip. He got in the car and drove home, his stomach rumbling. He didn't even like French dressing. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/55l9zo/norman_goes_to_an_allyoucaneat_buffet/] createDate=[1475485184] score=[179] numComments=[12]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman discovers rubber cement] author=[gerwer] text=[Norman went to Home Depot looking for a new light bulb for his fridge. The bulb in his fridge hadn't burned out; he only wanted to be prepared. 

Having secured the proper bulb, he headed for an exit, this time going through an unfamiliar aisle, which was rare for Norman. 

"Why not?" Thought Norman. 

Halfway through the empty aisle, Norman saw it. 

"Rubber cement? Is this some kind of joke? How can something be both rubber and cement?" Norman thought. 

Norman looked around, expecting to see either Allen Funt or Ashton Kutcher peeking at him from a distance, but he saw neither individual. Norman shook his head in disgust and left the Home Depot, vowing never to return. 

Norman went home, sat down, and Norman jumped on his lap. 

"Is Allen Funt even alive?" Norman asked Norman.

</thread><thread title=[Norman is late] author=[IDontItsCinnamon] text=[Through no fault of his own, Norman found himself waking to a much brighter lit sky than usual one morning. He quickly sat up and glanced at his alarm clock and, to his dismay, saw the red flash of "12:00" angrily blinking at him. 

"There must have been a power outage with last night's wind!" he shouted to Norman as he hurriedly jumped out of bed. He quickly grabbed the pair of pants he had worn the day before and pulled them on, trying to rub out the wrinkles as he ran to the closet to grab a clean shirt. He hurriedly pulled on a sweater, flattened down his hair in the mirror and picked up his cell phone to look at the time. 8:56! Four minutes to make a fifteen minute drive, and Norman knew it wasn't possible to make it on time. 

As he rushed out the door, practicing what he was going to tell his boss to explain his lateness, he heard a quick "mew!" and realized that he hadn't fed Norman. He stood in the driveway and began to panic. If he went back to feed Norman, it would take an extra two minutes at least, making him even later. But if he didn't, Norman would be hungry all day. So Norman quickly ran in the house, opened a can of Fancy Feast and set it down on the ground. Norman would just have to eat out of the can, there was no time to flake it in his dish.

On his commute to work, Norman remembered hearing that police wouldn't pull you over if you were only going 5 miles over the speed limit. So he set his cruise control to 50 rather than 45 and looked at the clock. 9:01. Late. He'd never been late before and his face turned bright red. This was going to be embarrassing. His pants were wrinkled, his hair disheveled, he'd forgotten his lunch and when he walked in, all eyes would be on him. 

At 9:09, he pulled into the parking lot and was surprised, then relieved to see there were no cars. "It's Saturday," he thought to himself. "Not late at all. In fact, I'm nearly two days early!" He chuckled to himself as he put his car in reverse and backed out of the parking lot. On the way home, he stopped at the market to get a bag of cat treats to apologize to Norman. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5asp9h/norman_is_late/] createDate=[1478151040] score=[180] numComments=[7]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Plays Skyrim: Special Edition] author=[ParadigmTheory] text=[Norman was enjoying a warm cup of medium dark roast coffee in his kitchen when he heard the knock on his door.

"It's too early for anyone to be awake to visit. It must be the mail," Norman remarked to himself.

Norman got up and walked to the front door, taking his coffee mug with him. He opened the door and instinctively looked at the porch, expecting mail. Sure enough, a small package was sitting there, and Norman spotted the UPS truck driving away in the distance. Norman picked up the package and closed the door

Norman finished his coffee and went to go find a knife. He was very careful to keep the blade pointed away from himself, as to not accidentally injure himself. He cut the tape on the package, and opened the box. Sitting inside was a small case, labeled "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition." 

Norman had ordered the game off of Craigslist about two weeks ago after his son had recommended it to him. Norman decided he would trust his son and try it out. He took the plastic wrapping off the case, opened it, and took the disc out.

Norman booted up his computer and put the game disc into the disc drive. It took awhile for the game to start, since Norman's computer was a few years old and wasn't quite powerful enough to run the game at full potential. When the game finally started, Norman noticed how slow it was running, even on the main menu. 

His cat, Norman, was sitting nearby, and Norman remarked to him, "Heh, what do you expect? My computer can barely run  Minesweeper as it is."

Norman clicked on "New Game" and sat back. The game was running slowly, but he was able to determine what was going on. He saw that he was bound up in a cart, sitting with 3 other prisoners. One of them talked about a rebellion, and how they were on their way to be executed.

Norman did not want to play a game where his character was branded as a criminal. With a sigh, Norman ejected the disc and turned off his computer. Putting it back in the case, Norman placed the case in his desk drawer.

"Maybe I'll see what's on TV instead," he said to himself.

</thread><thread title=[Norman gets self-conscious] author=[boobobaggins] text=[Norman's drive home from work was a little out of the ordinary: not only did he not get startled by the radio ad with the car horn in it today, but his journey home was sprinkled with rain. It wasn't enough rain to warrant the wipers going full speed, but was too much rain for the slowest speed: the windshield would get covered in raindrops by the next go-round of the wipers, and he couldn't have that. So Norman tried the second click. While it cleared the rain more to his satisfaction, the few drops that accumulated before being wiped again made him uncomfortable, so he clicked up to the third speed. 

"My wipers are going pretty fast for this light amount of rain," Norman said to himself. "This looks silly." But this speed cleared the windshield to his liking. He sat back into the seat, secure in his decision. Then another car drove past, and their windshield wipers appeared to be going slower than his. Not wanting to look like a worried old fool, Norman set his wiper speed back down a click.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4floer/norman_gets_selfconscious/] createDate=[1461155450] score=[178] numComments=[14]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman writes a Norman story] author=[jzigsjzigs] text=[Norman did a Yahoo search for "cats."  He found some amusing pictures, but he eventually stumbled across a forum where users shared funny stories about their cats.  He laughed at, and then pitied the cat who fell down the stairs after rolling around in cat nip.

Then Norman thought, I must have dozens of Norman stories as good as that.  

Norman sat at the keyboard for some time, thinking.  Should I use the story about the time he broke the lamp?  What about the time he almost caught the mouse, but ran into the wall?

Finally, he made a decision.

"I have a cat named Norman.  I am also named Norman.  One time Norman (the cat) had to be taken to the vet for his shots.  Norman (the cat) doesn't like to go the vet, and he especially hates shots.  So when I got him home I gave him a treat; a tin can of tuna.  Just before I got the can open, he scratched me across the lib, breaking the skin.  I retreated, and bandaged myself.  When I returned, I was treated with a nice snuggle.  I love Norman (the cat)."

Submit

Norman immediately noticed his error.  After frantically searching for an edit button, and not finding one, he deleted his post.  

Phew, that was close, he thought.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4r96os/norman_writes_a_norman_story/] createDate=[1467693887] score=[179] numComments=[10]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman encounters a mild inconvenience while looking for a bottle of water at Target.] author=[Rafikim] text=[Norman walked into the store, refreshed by the gust of cool air during this hot summer's day, and made his way around the cashiers' stands to those ever-present Coca-Cola coolers containing various beverages being sold at a high price just ever so slightly above the norm. Today, he was looking for a bottle of water.

Norman opened the first refrigerator he came across, and found not a bottle of water in sight. He pushed a few bottles of Fanta and Powerade around, and yet the cooler seemed to be fresh out of water.

Somewhat inconvenienced, as he had a dentist's appointment in just under an hour, and the water was the only item he planned on purchasing that day, he made his way to the next register line and peered inside that fridge. 

Yet again, there was no water to be found. Instead of wasting semi-precious time peering deeper into the depths of the cooler, Norman let out a heavy sigh and walked over to the next register's fridge. Luckily, the store was not crowded at all, so he was not disturbing the huge line that may be typical at any other time of day. 

This fridge, belonging to register seven, was not only out of water, but also Fanta and Coke as well. Norman found this mildly amusing, knowing that someone else, albeit looking for an entirely different product, might have also suffered the same inconvenience that he had. 

It was on the fourth refrigerator he tried that Norman declared victory. With a sigh of relief, he reached into the back of the cooler and pulled out a bottle of water. As the condensation began to form on the bottle as it came into contact with the warmer air of the department store, Norman made his way to the nearest open checkout lane, as the one in which he found the water was closed.

It was behind the elderly lady with far too many items that Norman decided to forsake his one-item rule for the day and buy a 14-pack of anti-cavity gum with the hopes to impress his dentist in about half an hour's time. 

Norman payed for the two items with a five-dollar bill, and donated the remaining $1.49 to the charity box sitting on the register. He had done his good deed for the day and acquired what he came for despite his challenges, and he walked out of Target with a smile. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4peymj/norman_encounters_a_mild_inconvenience_while/] createDate=[1466685182] score=[177] numComments=[10]>

I understand that he often gets into awkward situations, and we've all had the sticky apple sticker issue at some point. I understand that he's passive. But this is past my suspension of disbelief. You'd have to have a debilitating condition to give up on eating an apple due to the sticker "defeating" you.

</thread><thread title=[Norman Jr.'s Convocation] author=[baween] text=[Norman arose with a start when he heard the phone ring. Norman typically had few callers save for people ringing him up to do a survey or to ask if his fridge was still running. The cool plastic of the receiver felt heavy in his hand as Norman picked up the phone.

"Hello? Norman speaking."

"Uh...hey Dad." Norman Jr. hadn't called in months but Norman knew that his son was probably busy with all manner of schoolwork and he was glad that Norman Jr. made the time to talk to him. "I just wanted to let you know that I'm going to graduate at the end of term." Norman figured this would be happening soon - Norman Jr. had only three credits left before graduating, if Norman had kept track properly - but it was nice to simply hear his son's voice again. It was especially great because that meant Norman Jr. had passed his mandatory honors seminar - when they last spoke Norman Jr. was right in the thick of what sounded like a difficult class. 

"That's great, son! Congrats! When's the graduation ceremony?" Norman was already thinking excitedly of what to get Norman Jr. to mark the event. No mere gift card would do. He'd have to leave out some extra kibble for Norman or ask for someone in the building to take care of him. Maybe Gladys, the lovely old lady at the end of the hall could come in and check up on Norman? It was only an overnight trip but one could never be too careful.

There was a pause and a sigh on the other end of the line. "Well, Dad, see...here's the thing. We're only allowed two tickets each. Mom's going to be coming and...well...I didn't want to make things too awkward so I was going to give the other ticket to Randy..."

The sting from hearing that name slowed Norman's response as if he had taken a wiffle bat to the ribcage. "That's...that's okay, son." A pause and a sigh. "You do what you need to do. I'd love to come visit soon if you've got the time?" Norman was afraid that he sounded too upset.

"Yeah yeah, Dad!" said Norman Jr., "I'll hit you up when I've got a few days. Gotta jet, Dad. Nice talking to you! Later!" The phone went dead. Norman didn't know what a "hitting up" or "having to jet" meant, but he could send Norman Jr. his present in the mail.

At the very least Randy couldn't take Norman from Norman, he thought. It sounded like Norman Jr. was doing well, and wasn't that all that really mattered?

He's been locked out of the apartment since then and has no idea what to do, he'll eat anything right now! Oh how he wishes he can get back in it. 

After a few minutes of going around the block, could it finally be his lucky day? He sees a middle-aged man throw out a can of something into the alleyway facing his apartment complex. 

Norman instantly heads toward it and is quickly disappointed as he overlooks a small empty can of chef Boyardee mini-ravioli. His belly makes a rumbling sound, it feels like he heard this sound over 40 times today.

As he heads back to his apartment, he decides to go up the stairs to see if anything changed since the last time he has done so. Something is different though, the lights are on inside the apartment! What is going on?!

Norman cautiously approaches the front door and smells food that is cooking through the screen window. As he's embracing the smell, he sees a figure quickly look at him and rush toward him.

The figure opens the door and says "Norman! You're back! I thought you ran away! Oh my gosh, you must be starving, I was so scared I lost you" as he picks him up.

Erring on the side of caution Norman went to his car and left the penny. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/50ie7f/norman_finds_a_penny/] createDate=[1472693416] score=[171] numComments=[2]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman buys donuts for the office] author=[bstix] text=[It was holiday season at Norman's work and as usual Norman was covering the holiday shift. Thursday, Norman looked at the schedule and counted that only seven people would be in the office on Friday. 


On his way to work Friday morning Norman took a detour around the bakery and picked up a pack of 9 donuts. It was a better deal to get a full pack of 9 than to buy 7 individual donuts. Arriving at work in good time, he placed it in a cupboard the kitchen and got back to his desk. Before the rest of the team came in, he sat and composed an e-mail: "Dear colleagues, Please help yourself to a donut in the kitchen, Kind regards, Norman.". He didn't send it just yet.


Nobody suspected a thing, as he sat in his office working. Then finally at 10'o'clock, he couldn't resist anymore. Norman walked to the kitchen, got the pack of donuts, placed it on the table and opened it. He then hurried back to his office and clicked "Send" on his message. After a while, he received two replies: "thanks Norm" and "great way to start the weekend :)". Norman felt good.


--- 


Later on the same Friday, Norman sat at home in his couch, when suddenly it hit him that he forgot to take home the remaining donuts. How many was left? Did anyone get rid of them?


"Oh dear, I better get in early on Monday to clean up the mess." he said to Norman.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4u28w0/norman_buys_donuts_for_the_office/] createDate=[1469214541] score=[170] numComments=[11]>

I can picture him walking back to his cubicle, but with a little bit faster pace than usual.

<comment number=[8]author=[MattressCrane]text=[Hey there! My name's Cameron and I'm working on [The Book of Norman](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/3yuh6v/the_book_of_norman_the_final_update/)- I'm in the final legs of the book, and right now I'm picking up another 40 stories to add to the roster before it's finished. 

So I'm wondering if you're interested in letting me add your story to the book! There won't be any pay involved, or a guarantee your story will make it into the final product, but you'll certainly be credited for your work, and appreciated by me and all the readers for the book.

Just PM me back here if you're interested.]score=[1] </comment>

<comment number=[12]author=[bstix]text=[Thanks for your input. I agree that there's room for improvement and more details, but I also wanted to keep it short and focused on the actions. It's a bit of a rabbit hole to get into Norman's "cake thanking list". Someone can probably that better than I.]score=[2] </comment>
