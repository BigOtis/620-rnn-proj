</thread><thread title=[Norman gets Pokemon Go] author=[DwelveDeeper] text=[Norman had been hearing all this news about Pokemon Go and decided to download the app on his new smartphone. He remembered Norman junior used to be obsessed with Pokemon in his younger years, and now that it was making a comeback, he decided to see what all the fuss was about.

He created his character, naming it Norman1970, because "Norman" was already taken. "Boy, there sure are a lot of Norman's in the world," he said to Norman, scratching him behind the ears. He chose his "monster," he thought the blue little turtle looked cute

"Now what?" Norman thought to himself. Nothing was happening.

He thought maybe Norman Jr would know. He texted him, "Hi Norman! I just got that new Pokeman app. Have you got it yet?"

Almost immediately he received a reply, excitedly, Norman checked his phone. "Hey dad, yeah it's great! And it's Pokemon"

Confused by the last sentence, but ignoring it, Norman replied, "yeah it is fun. Is there a way for me to be friends with you on it?"

"No, not yet."

Disappointed, Norman replied, "Okay, we'll have fun. Don't forget to play your turn on Words with Friends!"

Norman didn't receive a reply, "he must be busy playing that new Pokeman game," thought Norman. He opened up the app again, but still didn't understand what to do and couldn't find any instructions. Sighing, Norman laid down his phone and turned on an old episode of CSI. About 30 minutes in, his phone buzzed with a notification that Norman Jr had played a word.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4tuill/norman_gets_pokemon_go/] createDate=[1469092962] score=[806] numComments=[29]>

<comment number=[1]author=[lagerdalek]text=[Maurice was always the popular, handsome one. 

Norman felt pretty annoyed that he was ignored so much at work but a simple one-liner from Maurice had them all so wowed, but secretly he was also chuffed that his coworkers mistook Maurice for him.

Norman took an extra long look at himself in the mirror that night. Maybe he was a little handsome, he had Maurice's strong jawline, and he had more hair.

Turning to his bedroom, Norman subconsciously stopped pulling his stomach in.

<comment number=[7]author=[Turbo_Sandwich]text=[There needs to be an outright ban on showing images of what we think Norman looks like. 

This isn't Norman to me. But now I will see Norman this way. This post has ruined Norman.

Edit: ok, I spoke hastily. This didn't ruin Norman for me. But I think a large part of what makes Norman so appealing is that we each have our own idea of what he looks like. It makes it personal. 

Besides, I think we can all agree Norman wouldn't be comfortable knowing strangers were sharing his picture on the internet.

As the cashier started to ring Norman up he realized that the woman left behind her wallet. Quickly he retrieved her wallet and called after her. His heart pounding the woman turned around and headed back to him. "Thank you so much" she exclaimed "I don't know what I would have done!" Before Norman could say anything she gave him a quick kiss and was on her way.

Norman blushed as he awoke to the sound of his alarmclock. "Norman, I just had the most unusual and exciting dream!" He proudly told his best friend.

</thread><thread title=[Norman abuses drugs] author=[imakanyemess] text=[Norman laid limp on his couch, rubbing his temples and clenching his eyelids. This headache had been mildly inconviencing him for almost 2 whole hours now, and he was *really* enjoying reading a tutorial on proper garden hedge clipping technique, but even the lowest brightness setting on his Dell laptop aggravated the headache.

Norman decided he had had enough, and needed to get off the couch and take action. A pack of aspirin lay on the counter in the kitchen, and Norman thought it best to read through the instructional leaflet  (after all, someone took the time to write it). He proceeded to take two tablets, as recommended, followed by a slice of conservatively buttered wholemeal toast. 

Half an hour passed, and Norman had felt no effect from the aspirin. This slightly irked him, and in a moment of ruthless impulse, Norman knocked back a third aspirin with a glass of water. An overwhelming feel of instant regret rushed through him as a result of his horribly irresponsible actions, and Norman wondered whether he truly knew himself.

</thread><thread title=[Norman Makes Dinner 28 Times.] author=[DIRCAM] text=[It had been a *long* time since Norman had made dinner.

Well, it had only been 24 hours, for Norman made dinner at 5:45 sharp in the evening, every evening.

But it had been a long time since Norman *truly* made dinner. For the past few weeks he stuck to the usual comfortable routine– a ***Best Choice Microwave Meal.™***

There was comfort in weekly routine, but comfort could also be found in yearly traditions. And after five years of divorce, Norman still hadn't shook one particular tradition from his years of marriage.


The day was April 18th 1988. Norman had sheepishly invited a classmate over for dinner; she quickly accepted. He cooked balsamic-glazed salmon fillets, a quick yet impressive recipe he learned a few weeks ago from a book he found on the floor of the university library.

It went over *very* well– The fish, not the book. (Norman would never go over with a library book, he was steadfast when it came to returning them on time.)

27 years later, Norman still made the Salmon Fillets every April 18th, though he had been without a wife to share it with for five years. He pretended it was in defiance to his ex-wife, a reclaiming of the dish as his own. 

Really, he just feared breaking the yearly routine.

"Wild Asian Ass" the clue read.  He was really stumped and wanted to win because a completed crossword could be returned and entered into a draw for a csi box set.  Suddenly Norman had an idea.  He could Google the clue to get the answer.  He struggled with the morality of cheating before he decided to throw caution to the wind.  

W.. I.. L.. D Norman typed in the letters while frantically looking around the office lest he be caught cheating.  A.. S.. I....... Wait! "Onager!"  Norman remembered the nature documentary with the narrator with the soothing voice.  He deleted his search and walked to the post box after work with his head held high.  

He told Norman all about when he got home.  A few days later after the competition had ended.  Norman rushed to his door to check the post.  And there it was.  His entry,  with return to sender written on it,  in his haste Norman had forgotten a stamp.

Norman is not too disturbed by this, as he has been awake since 6:57 am. But as he lifts his head from the pillow, he feels some throbbing in his temple. His nose is also stuffy. 

"There has been a cold going around the office... better check my temperature".

Norman lets out a small cough as he checks his thermometer. "99 degrees, not good... "

He sits at the foot of his bed and thinks. He took a sick day eight months ago, would it look bad to take another one so soon? Then again, would his coworkers be annoyed by periodic nose blowing?

Norman decides that he should go in. "You never know when you'll need that sick day for something serious."

As Norman walks through his living room, he sees Norman sleeping on the ground. Norman looks up tiredly. "... mew." A small pile of vomit is in the corner.

</thread><thread title=[Norman Gets a Text Message] author=[ButtDialNotBootyCall] text=[It was 2:34am on a Tuesday and Norman was fast asleep in his bed. Suddenly, he was awoken by a sharp "ding" sound that he didn't recognize. Startled, he sat up in bed and looked around the room. He noticed his cell phone glowing as it sat charging on his dresser.

Confused and perturbed, Norman got out of bed and walked across the bedroom to check why his phone had made this noise. As he stumbled towards his phone, he considered using the outlet next to his bedside table in the future. 

When Norman got to his phone, he saw that he had a text message notification. Norman was surprised, because he never gets text messages. He tried to recall when he received his last text message, but couldn't. 

"Who would possibly send me a text message in the middle of the night? Do they know I have to wake up in 4 hours?", Norman asked Norman, who sat squinty eyed on his cat perch in the corner. 

Curiously, and somewhat nervously, he opened the text message. 

"AMBER ALERT - Plate HHG-5509 (PA), White Toyota Camry, 4 Door"

Norman's heart sank, and he felt extreme guilt for questioning the urgency of the text message. Now Norman was wide awake. He began considering his options. He tried to recall CSI episodes of kidnappings. After 5 minutes of consideration, Norman realized he didn't have a enough information to do anything. He laid back in bed and repeated the license plate number in his head so that he could be on the lookout tomorrow. 

Norman didn't get any more sleep that night.

He got out of bed 4 hours later to get ready for work. On his way to work, Norman noticed 5 different white 4-door cars, but didn't believe any to be a Toyota Camry. 

Feeling somewhat disappointed in himself, Norman sat at his computer and opened his web browser, whose homepage is set to the local news station. He read the headline, "Missing girl found". Norman was very relieved, and felt a huge weight off his shoulders. He smiled and thought about how great this day had started.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/494jyt/norman_gets_a_text_message/] createDate=[1457246030] score=[516] numComments=[25]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman lifts something heavy.] author=[PunchMeat] text=[Norman was taking his five minute break at the water cooler again, hoping to strike up a conversation, when Lisa spotted him and called him over.

"I need to move this to the top of my cabinet," she said, indicating a box on her desk.

"I can help with that," said Norman confidently. He was, after all, two inches taller than Lisa.

He took a moment to unbutton his cuffs and neatly roll up his sleeves, then gripped the box handles.

"Careful, it's a bit heavy," said Lisa.

"I'll lift with my legs," Norman assured her, recalling the horror stories in a recent employee safety video.

Norman bent at the knees and lifted. The box was indeed heavy, but not unmanageable. With a quiet grunt, he lifted it over his head and pushed it on top of the cabinet. Then Norman dusted his hands and turned to find that Lisa had been sitting on the edge of her desk, watching him keenly.

"Yes?" he asked.

"Oh! Nothing," she said, almost as breathless as he was.

If there had been a body on the table, the moment would have reminded Norman of a romantic scene he'd recently watched on CSI. "Is there anything else I can help you with?" he asked, his heart racing as he worried he was employing an unacceptable level of double-entendre for the office.

"No," Lisa said with a slight smile. "That was all that I wanted."

The excitement over, Norman tipped an invisible hat and left to return to his desk. He decided he would try for a conversation at the water cooler again tomorrow, and penciled it into his calendar.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/49ozb4/norman_lifts_something_heavy/] createDate=[1457571670] score=[502] numComments=[15]>

Norman closes his eyes, and lets his mind drift to her. Shared laughter, moments of joy, moments of struggle. Norman sifts through it all, happily and sorrowfully. 

Norman winces as a wave of pure desire and longing surge through his body. Norman grabs his headphones, and finds that song he loves, the one she showed him. It reminds him of her presence.

He listens over, and over again. In his mind he's embracing her.

</thread><thread title=[Norman gets mugged] author=[Dotcor_Strangelove] text=[Norman was waiting at the bus stop on his way home from the library.  He was very excited about having found a Dean Koontz novel that he had not yet read.  It was a chilly evening, and the bulb had burnt out above the stop.


A man came up and stood beside him at the bus stop with his hood up.  Norman did not think anything of this, and idly thumbed through the novel in front of him.  He was careful not to crease the pages.  “Library books are not yours, Norman,” his mother had always said. “They belong to everybody.”


The man beside him turned towards him, so Norman looked over and offered a smile.  “Your wallet,” said the man.


Norman was perplexed, and asked him what he meant.


“Your wallet!” The stranger repeated himself. “Give me your wallet, old man!


Norman understood and nodded.  With trembling hands he took his wallet out of his hip pocket.  The man in the hood grabbed it and ran off into the night.  Norman’s heart pounded and his head began to spin.  He hardly even noticed the bus pulling up.


When the driver asked if he was okay, he nodded and paid his fare from the change in his pocket.  As he sat down and the bus pulled away, Norman noticed he had dropped the novel without even realising it and had left it at the stop.

He resolved to call the library first thing in the morning to apologise.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4bgxhp/norman_gets_mugged/] createDate=[1458673036] score=[402] numComments=[19]>

Which is fair, as usually they're written poorly or are just trying to be extreme for the sake of being extreme which is silly but I thought this mugging one was good.

</thread><thread title=[Norman pranks Norman] author=[Bloodsail_Admiral] text=[On March 31st, Norman was shopping at the grocery store, getting his typical things for the week, when he overheard someone talking in the next aisle	 over.


“Dude this prank is going to be hilarious.” Norman heard one person say.


Of course, tomorrow would be the first day of April, and all kinds of hi jinks would ensue! Normally April Fools made Norman queasy, but he was feeling particularly festive this year. He walked over to the cat food aisle and picked out a different brand of cat food than he normally purchased.


Norman could barely contain himself on the drive home.


The following morning Norman got up five minutes early, and went to go feed Norman, after opening the can and pouring the food into the tray, he eyed the door, waiting for his feline friend to appear. After several minutes, Norman arrived, and hopped up onto the table. Norman smirked as Norman sniffed the cat food.


Norman then turned around, and jumped off the table, leaving Norman alone with the cat food.


Norman did not prank Norman again next year.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4cw06b/norman_pranks_norman/] createDate=[1459551145] score=[389] numComments=[7]>

Bad with split-second decisions and feeling nervous, Norman's hands began to feel clammy.  He looked at his coworker and noticed that despite walking at a decent pace he had hardly moved.  Norman blinked.

</thread><thread title=[The Book of Norman- The Time Has(almost) Finally Come/The Writers Who Made the Final Cut] author=[MattressCrane] text=[(If you're interested in hearing some of the progress on the book over the last number of months, feel free to read this overly long speech. If you're here to see who made the cut, and why others did not, skip to the last two paragraphs.)

Hello all! After a long, long while, I'm here with another update. Unfortunately I stated that there was a final update, and that no other update would come after it, which somewhat made me a recluse when it came to sharing information. Most of my info let out was through people specifically asking me, "What the hell are you doing with the book, Cameron!?", and I realize that isn't fair that I made you all have to reach out to me to find out that info. Anyways, I have some news.

The book is finished. Finito. Completo. Donno. Sort of. The innards, all the stories, and all the edits, which there were many, are complete. Frankly, I've had enough stories included in the book since February; that being 365. However, things change. The tone of the book has shifted a lot since the conception of the project, and because of that, stories I collected at the beginning no longer lined up with the thought process I had near the end.

So more stories were collected. Newer, fresher, more in line with what I had in mind. Then, the book shifts again, and I realize there's only so many stories you can have of Norman missing the bus and getting caught in the rain. So I scrapped some repetition.

So more stories were collected. Now, people are starting to write plotlines on the subreddit! Lisa is born! Frank's a drunk! Norman gets some confidence! Ideas that were non-existent start to pop up. "I wish I thought of that earlier" turns into "Damn, I can't *not* put this in the book." So more stories are cut, and more are added. Variety. Levels of skill in writers advance. Some people just disappear and I can't make edits to their story, forcing me to cut. 

So more stories were collected. Now, it's just the best of the crop. Months after finishing, I'll find some damn good stories, better than anything already included. More is cut. More is added. More is cut, yadda yadda.

Then I realized, this will never stop. So long as the subreddit exists, there will be more stories, better stories, than anything written thus far. It evolves. No matter how many rounds of edits I do, re-reading the exact same story two dozen times, there will undoubtedly be typos. I hope not, I did my best, but there will always be grammatical slips, like finding grains of sand in your shoe years later. 

So now, the book is done. It's reached a point where I can be proud of what its become, something that I hope you'll all enjoy. The thing that let's me know it's good, is when I re-read a story, one I've read dozens of times, and known the punchline for a year, but still manage to crack a smile, or even feel a punch in the gut from. It's littered with remarkable talent, fun stories, cute illustrations, and the fine line of boring yet undeniably charming that Norman always had.

This is not the end, and I realize I should stop praising the final product before it even exists. Hell, the whole point of this post here was for one purpose- to show which writers made the cut. I feel that I should post it well ahead of time, since, as this post has hopefully made clear, I had to cut a lot of stories. I felt bad about it. After a while, I had to move the names of the writers away from the stories and number them instead, since some people were so sincere and heartfelt with me, that I just felt horrible removing their stories after I told them it'd be included. If you didn't make the list, know that I am sorry, that it was nothing personal, and it wasn't always because it was better or worse than what made the book. There was a bigger picture involved. Sometimes a fantastic story delves too far from the books set canon, and creates inconsistency with a dozen other stories. Sometimes there will be a story similar to three other stories, but only one of them hits the notes needed for that part of the book. Sometimes, people don't respond to me, and I didn't feel comfortable publishing an altered story. Things get cut.

But it was all for the best; to make this book to be in the best shape it can be, without strings attached. And so, without further ado, here's the list. To those of you included, you'll be receiving a PM shortly. Basically, I'll give you one last chance to see what your story is, if you're interested, and make sure that if I made any changes that you're not fine with, that you can have this last chance to pull out or work it out with me.

Now you ask- how long before it's published? Well, even though the book is finished, all the needed assets are not. I'm still waiting on artists and artwork, so forgive me. I'm very much hoping to have all the pieces finished in the next few weeks. Then, I'm going to order a review copy of the book, and if all is well, I'll publish it! Then, it'll be available for order through Amazon. 

I think a few weeks after that, I'll try and get the e-book version out there as well. One thing at a time. 

As for people asking about pre-orders, know that there won't be anything. I'm a believer that pre-orders are just an excuse for money to be made before people find out whether or not a thing is good. So, buy it once it's out, or even after the early adopters tell you if it's worth the money. It's all still going to charity though, so hopefully you won't feel too out of pocket if you're disappointed with the result, but then again, that's no excuse.

So, let's just see where it goes, okay?] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/52u22t/the_book_of_norman_the_time_hasalmost_finally/] createDate=[1473934185] score=[328] numComments=[42]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman dodges a bullet] author=[VanRolly] text=[As Norman walked out the front door and into the bright sunlight, a tickling sensation arose behind his eyes and in his nose. 

Feeling the oncoming sneeze building quickly in intensity, he reached into the right pocket of his pleated trousers for his handkerchief only to find it missing. 

As the sneeze was about to crest, he frantically patted his hand on his left trouser pocket and then the chest pocket of his short-sleeved button down shirt only to find them empty too except for a button that had come loose from his favourite pair of pants earlier in the week. He had put it in his shirt pocket for safekeeping while at work so he could sew it back on securely once he'd returned home that evening. 

The sudden remembrance of this forgotten task stopped his sneeze in its tracks, and he blinked twice before murmuring to himself "well that was rather too close for comfort."

Norman immediately turned around and went back into the house to retrieve his handkerchief and place the button on his kitchen table for safekeeping until he got home and could sew it back onto his slacks. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4a010e/norman_dodges_a_bullet/] createDate=[1457749595] score=[326] numComments=[20]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman celebrates Father's Day] author=[Cygnus--X1] text=[For Norman, this Sunday was no more eventful than most others, though he had slept in a little longer than usual, snoozing twice instead of once. He had gotten up, showered, had breakfast, read the paper, then did some chores around the house while humming a rather annoying yet catchy song he had had stuck in his head for a few days now.

He was in the middle of doing the dishes when the doorbell rang. Curious, Norman dried off his hands and went to the door. 

"Afternoon sir", the man in the UPS uniform said to him as he handed Norman a small but heavy package. As the delivery man was already on his way back to his van, Norman had just enough time to mutter "Thanks", all the while trying to remember what he'd ordered.

Still racking his brain, Norman put the package on the kitchen table and removed the brown paper around it. "I don't know either, Norman", he told his cat that was looking at him quizzically.

In the package were three dark bottles of ale, centered around a big beer mug. There was plastic wrapping around it, with a little bow lint on top. Attached to it was a card. Norman opened it.

**"Happy Father's Day, Dad! :) X Norm Jr. &amp; Jess"**

For what seemed like minutes, Norman couldn't move. He kept staring at the bottles, and felt a tear well up in his eye. He wanted to say something, anything, to Norman the cat or to himself or to no one in particular, but his throat was swollen.

That night, Norman drank two of the bottles from the beer mug. He didn't usually like ale, and these specific brews were sour and watery, but he drank them all the same and loved every swig of it.

When he lay in bed that night, he didn't know if his head was swarming from the beers or the happiness he felt.

</thread><thread title=[Norman rebels.] author=[Ibex89] text=[It was 9:16 a.m. and Norman was sitting on a lightly padded chair in the office kitchen at work. His manager was giving a presentation. As the stream of words drifted through the room, Norman began to notice that he felt rather tired. Odd, since he’d gotten his usual eight hours of sleep, and had drunk the same warm cup of coffee with cream that he always drank. A friendly bank teller had persuaded him yesterday to have a piece of hard candy, and he wondered sleepily if that could be the root of his lethargy. He’d read somewhere that too much sugar can affect sleep quality.

After a short time, Norman noticed that he was having trouble focusing on his manager’s presentation, having missed the last few sentences. What’s more, Norman felt a yawn coming on. Now, Norman is not usually one to draw attention to himself, especially in such a professional atmosphere. He started to become worried – what if his manager thought that Norman was not engaged with the presentation? Norman did not want to consider the ramifications of such a thought, and though he feared making a scene, the urge to yawn was creeping slowly but steadily through his body.

Then a strange and new thought occurred to Norman. He realized that he really WASN’T engaged in the presentation. He WAS rather bored by his manager today. Perhaps, Norman thought, I AM willing to shake things up a little, and give a good yawn. Nothing big, nothing flashy, just a nice, satisfying yawn.

As Norman considered it, he liked the idea more and more. He sat up and prepared himself for his act of rebellion. By this time, however, he found that he was much too excited, and the urge to yawn had left him entirely.

No more candy for me, Norman thought. It makes me kind of wild.

He listened attentively to the last three minutes of the presentation.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4gw7qn/norman_rebels/] createDate=[1461907653] score=[317] numComments=[9]>

Norman looked around the room to see if other objects in there could jog his memory when suddenly his eyes laid upon the water fountain. 

"Perhaps I came in here to grab some water?" Norman asked nobody in particular. "No that can't be, because I am not thirsty." He reassured himself.

Norman realized that whatever it was that he came in here for must have probably not been very important and decided it was probably best to set this mystery aside for anther time. Perhaps he would remember it later on as he continued on his work. 

Norman walked back to his desk and took a seat when suddenly it popped into his head like a light bulb. *ohhhh* Norman thought. He *did* go in there for some water. Norman considered getting back up but realized he had already wasted too much company time as it was. "I am thirsty," Norman said to himself, "but not THAT thirsty."] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/49vgrx/norman_forgets_why_he_entered_a_room/] createDate=[1457672545] score=[308] numComments=[8]>

<comment number=[3]author=[HydrA-]text=[Isn't there a story of Norman going to the bathroom, similar to this? Ah yes, here it is

&gt;It was the middle of the afternoon, and Norman got up from his desk to go make some copies. After walking for a minute, he suddenly realized he'd absentmindedly turned down the hallway towards the bathroom instead of the one towards the copy room. There were other people walking around the office, and Norman didn't want to look foolish by just turning around in the middle of the hallway. So Norman kept going and walked into the bathroom. There were also other people in the bathroom, so Norman walked to the sink and rinsed his hands for a second so that it would look like he'd had a reason for coming in. Then he left the bathroom and headed to the copy room.
As he made his copies, Norman thought to himself that he'd have to pay more attention to where he was walking next time.

And the fact he had nothing planned for the evening.

Not even CSI.

There's only so much CSI you can watch. He knew he'd have to leave it for at least a few months before he could repeat binge the latest series. He had enjoyed the binge but it played havoc with his schedules. He preferred the drip-feed of regular television. Now he had the power to choose his viewing schedule.

He didn't need that kind of responsibility.    
&amp;nbsp;
He had been thinking about the game 'No Man's Sky'. Norman didn't own a playstation or any other console, apart from his PC. A lot of people had said that the gameplay was very repetitive.

This was something Norman was good at.

<comment number=[29]author=[potentialPizza]text=[That site is filled with fallacious arguments.

&gt;Gin is not a good counterexample because it’s a drink derived from juniper berries, so its name is from the Dutch jenever for “juniper”. Gem comes from the Latin gemma for “jewel”. As for the other words, they are abbreviations of larger words, so they inherited their pronunciations.

What the hell? So having a root from another language means that it doesn't count? The words with hard g's that the site lists have roots too. And how is it relevant that the other words (Gym, Geo, and Gel) are abbreviations of longer words? They're still completely valid examples of the soft G.

&gt;It’s the most natural, logical way to pronounce it. That’s why when everyone comes across the word for the first time, they use a hard G.

What a totally objective statement! I'm sure nobody has a different experience!

&gt;The creator of the GIF image format, Steve Wilhite of CompuServe, when deciding on the pronunciation, said he deliberately chose to echo the American peanut butter brand, Jif, and CompuServe employees would often say “Choosy developers choose GIF(jif)”, playing off of Jif’s television commercials. If you hear anyone pronounce GIF with a soft G, it’s because they know something of this history.

Oh! I didn't know the story that I'd never heard of was why I instinctively pronounced it with a soft g the first time I saw it! Gee, the creator of this website sure knows a lot about me!

&gt;Speaking of Steve Wilhite, when he explains the pronunciation of GIF, he himself has to explicitly write, “It’s pronounced ‘JIF’.” He has to explain it this way because it goes against how it would naturally be pronounced.

No, he has to explain it because it's a well-known, divisive controversy.

I really don't care how people pronounce it, but I have a problem with the condescending, illogical arguments that site uses.]score=[5] </comment>

</thread><thread title=[Norman is Named] author=[MattressCrane] text=[Norman put down the cage on the kitchen counter. Inside, a little kitten meowed actively, eager to get out.

"Hold your horses, little kitten!" Norman said to himself. Norman then giggled at the joke he had just made.

Norman couldn't wait to let the little cat out of the cage. But he knew he couldn't- it would feel like he was opening someone else's gift. It would be opening someone else's gift. Norman sneaked little treats through the bars of the cage, until finally Norman Jr came home from school.

"Hey Junior, are you ready for your birthday present?" Norman announced gleefully. Norman Jr was still busy taking off his shoes when Norman shouted. The little boy tossed his bag into the air, happily running into the kitchen.

"What is it what is it what is it!" He shouted, jumping up and down. Norman took the cage off the counter, lowered it to the floor, and cracked open the door handle.

Norman Jr was ecstatic! The boy grabbed the kitten up, embraced him in his arms, and gave the feline creature a gentle, loving hug.

"This kitten is no toy," Norman lectured, "it's a living thing. Are you willing to have it be your responsibility from now on?"

"Yes daddy I am! I swear, I'll feed it, I'll water it, I'll take it for walks-"

"I believe you!" Norman cried. Norman Jr placed the kitten carefully down on the floor; watching it waddle and explore the room. Then, Norman Jr jumped to his father, giving him a big hug, the strongest, tightest bear hug he could manage.

"What are you going to name it?" Norman asked his son.

Norman Jr thought carefully. He scratched his head, then a smile came onto his face.
"Norman," the boy said surely.

"You're naming the cat after yourself? That's a little funny, don't ya think?"

"I'm naming it after you, dad. So you'll always be with me."

Later that night, as Norman brushed his teeth, he started to cry. He was proud.

He smiled, wondering who would be texting him this afternoon. He set down the rag and reached his hand into his right pocket, only to find the phone was not there. The text message had been a figment of his wandering imagination.

This led Norman to wonder, *"Where is my phone?"*, as it wasn't in his pocket. He began searching all of the usual spots, the bathroom, the car, the dining room, even under the cat napping on the bookshelf. 

He chuckled to himself upon discovering that the phone had been in his left hand the entire time. He thought of a joke about it being "handy" to find his phone there, though sighed when he had no one around to share his humor with.

</thread><thread title=[Norman gets his wallet back] author=[PayMyTrollToll] text=[Norman just arrived home from work after a very stressful week.   Norman sat down with Norman to watch a rerun of CSI,  wondering if next week his luck would turn around.  

Just as the opening credits to CSI began,  a loud and determined knock at the door startled Norman and Norman.  "Who could that be?"  Norman thought to himself.   Norman stood up from the couch and walked towards the front door. 

Norman opened the door and to much surprise a police officer was standing on his porch.  "Good evening sir,  is your name Norman?"  asked the officer.  A quick wave of mixed emotions washed over Norman,  frantically thinking what wrongdoing Norman could have possibly done to summon a police officer to his door.

Norman quickly replied "Yes,  I'm Norman".  The officer asked Norman if he was the victim of a mugging this week,  and if his wallet had been stolen.  Norman told the officer about his mugging incident at the bus stop earlier this week.  Before Norman could finish his recount of that night,  the officer pulled Norman's wallet out of a brown paper bag marked "evidence". 

The officer explained to Norman he found the wallet on a man he arrested earlier in the week.  The officer explained to Norman since it was a misdemeanor crime not committed in his presence,  he was unable to charge this man with a crime unless Norman was willing to make a citizens arrest. 

"An arrest?!" Norman thought to himself.  Just like on CSI...  But Norman had never pictured himself taking such heroic action.  Norman quickly contemplated whether or not he should let this criminal go.  "Stealing" Norman thought to himself.  Norman knew he could not let this slide.  "I'll do it officer.   I'll make the arrest,  where is he?!" 

The officer handed Norman a piece of paper titled "citizens arrest form"  and explained to Norman all he had to do was sign it and the charges will be filed.  Norman signed the form and the officer returned his wallet to him. 

Norman returned to the couch with Norman,  with a feeling of relief and joy that justice was served and his wallet returned to him.  Norman chuckled to himself "imagine me,  making an arrest".] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4bj29u/norman_gets_his_wallet_back/] createDate=[1458705016] score=[261] numComments=[23]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman has a Disagreement with a Coworker] author=[MattressCrane] text=[Norman sighed as he spoke with June from sales.

A few minutes earlier, Norman stepped into the break room to hear June talking with another coworker. They were talking about their kids, and June specifically wanted to talk about the new vegan diet her family was partaking on.

"Jenny's only three," started June, "but she's loving her steamed broccoli dinners. She doesn't even miss all the sweets she used to have. Believe me."

The other coworker found an exit opportunity from the conversation when Norman entered the room.

"Hey Norman," he said, "do you have any kids?"

Norman enthusiastically told the two about Junior, his son who, despite all the lovely things Norman had to say, hasn't spoken with his father in over six months.

"Did you feed Junior sugar when he was a baby?" June asked. The coworker took the chance to flee the room.

"Yes, lots! He could be so noisy, and cry *so* much, but nothing a pop-tart couldn't fix!"

Norman regretted his statement. June spent the next twenty minutes prodding Norman and letting him know all the mistakes he made raising Junior.

</thread><thread title=[Norman finds a good deal.] author=[[deleted]] text=[It was Saturday morning and Norman needed to get Norman some cat food from the store. The weather was warm and dry and Norman thought it might be nice to walk. 
At the store, Norman was quite pleased to find that Norman’s favourite cat food was on special offer. He read the offer very carefully:

“Buy One Get One Free. All marked varieties. Offer cannot be used in conjunction with any other offer.”

It seemed like a very good offer indeed. 

Norman gave some careful thought to what he should do. He didn’t want to spoil Norman and, where would he store all of the extra cat food?

Norman realised that if he didn’t take advantage of the offer, he would have to choose another cat food. He wanted to avoid any awkwardness at the checkout. 
 
Norman decided that he could probably find room for the extra cat food and he should buy it. After all, it would save him another trip to the store next weekend. 

Then Norman remembered that he had walked to the store on that day and he would not be able to carry all of that cat food home by himself. 

Disappointed, Norman selected Norman’s second favourite brand and headed to the checkout. He decided not to tell Norman about this when he got home.

</thread><thread title=[Norman Keeps the Change] author=[CitizenPremier] text=[Every Tuesday at work, Norman would buy a bag of Cheez-its from the vending machine.  He would always make sure in the morning that he had a dollar and a quarter, so he would have the exact amount for the purchase.  But he would also always check the change slot, as a matter of habit.  Today when he bought his Cheez-its, he reached in the slot and found, to his surprise, fifty cents.  At first he was excited.  He put it into the change pocket in his wallet and walked excitedly back to his desk to eat lunch.  He poured the Cheez-its onto his plate and took the first bite of his sandwich, but as he did, he felt a wave of anxiety.  What if someone went back to the machine to get their change?  They might need the fifty cents.  They might even come over to Norman's desk to ask him for it, if they noticed his snacking habits.  Norman took the fifty cents and put it on the most visible corner of his desk, so that everyone could see it and know he wasn't trying to be a thief.

Norman looked up from his computer screen and scanned the office, noting a couple of empty desks. Some people really do love to clock off early, he thought to himself. 

Just as he refocused on his meticulously ordered spreadsheet, his boss walked around the corner and headed straight for him. 

"Norman, really solid effort this week, I've given everyone permission to start their weekends that hour earlier, you should go home and make the most of the nice weather." His boss chimed happily. 

"It's okay, I would like to finish this spreadsheet, and I promised Tom I would proof read his last proposal before Monday meetings."

"Suit yourself, have a good weekend" he replied. 

Norman smiled to himself, a solid effort and the offer to go home earlier. He must be making quite the difference he thought.

"Welcome to the mood study. My name is Carol and I'm going to be seeing you for the next year as part of the clinical trial. I'd like to thank you again for signing up to be a part of the study, Norman. I'd just li-".

"Actually," Norman Junior interjected, "could you just call me Norm? My old man's name is Norman". The tone in his voice told Carol exactly where she should pick up.

"Of course, Norm." Carol finished her explanation of the study from where Norm had interrupted before moving on. "You sound like there's something going on with your father. Could we start there with the mood survey?"

"Sure." Norm composed himself a bit before continuing. "I just told my Dad-uh, Norman that I gave his Convocation ticket to my step-Dad, Randy. I'm torn up about it, I guess." 

The staccato stabs of impossibly long nails on a mechanical keyboard stopped. "Hmm. What's your relationship like with your biological father?"

Norm had been thinking about that since he got off the phone with Norman. He had wanted to talk to his Dad more but his asshole roommate Steve was about to try to open a bottle with his teeth and Norm inevitably would be the one cleaning up the blood.

"I guess...he's not a bad dude, really. Kinda boring. Works at some office. As a kid he always told me to wear a helmet while riding my bike and to stay safe. He sometimes listens to polkas, for Christ's sake-" Norm punctuated his comment with an awkward chuckle. "Always wanted to make a model train set with me, but my Mom left to be with Randy and she told me about how cool he was and how I should live with her and Randy and we never got the chance. I'd almost want to do it now, just to see what Dad's up to."

Those stilleto nails summoned a box of Kleenex from a drawer as if they had read Norm's mind. "You take your time", Carol's voice was emotional aloe vera. 

"Randy was all about wild shit," Norm tried and failed to hide his contempt. "Big pecs, drank everyone under the table, screamed at the television with his buddies and went to the gym constantly. That shit gets tired, y'know?"

The hour with Carol melted under the weight of Norm's guilt. Carol swabbed his cheek and gave him a lab requisition for bloodwork. As he booked his next appointment Norm was already looking forward to following Carol's advice.

Later, at home, Norm tried to write a letter. He got as far as "Dear Dad" before his hand started trembling.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4lqip7/norman_jr_talks_about_norman/] createDate=[1464657175] score=[220] numComments=[8]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Gets Cancer] author=[mcmonsoon] text=[Norman woke up Tuesday morning with a strange, sharp pain in his left arm. He wasn't sure how this new pain came about, but he ruled out it being a result of a poor sleeping position. Norman always slept flat on his back with his arms at his side and he doesn't move the entire night. It had to be something else, he thought.

He sat at the edge of his bed preparing to dismount. His sleep-stiff body eventually creaked its way to the kitchen to make some coffee, but he stopped off at the den to use the computer first.

"G-O-O-G-L-E- Dot com," he typed with a single index finger into the address bar. "Pain in left arm causes"

 *Search.* 

The results were numerous. Most of the sites linked to pain medications and therapeutic heat pads, but the one that stuck out to Norman was some sort of internet hospital called "Web MD"  and according to the symptoms presented by this digital health professional, it was cancer.

Norman froze. He stood up and, like a zombie, walked to the bathroom to look at himself in the mirror.

"I have... arm cancer," Norman croaked. The color drained from his face and he stared, glossy eyed at his own reflection.


He picked his cat Norman up off of the floor and they curled up together in bed.


"Thanks for staying with me through all this, Norman."

</thread><thread title=[Norman likes cheap whisky] author=[Odysseus32] text=[Norman always did love fall. He couldn't quite put his finger on it, but it just felt right. The leaves changing were nice, and he loved a nice college football game, but the air just felt a tad bit different when late September came around. 

Kroger was particularly packed on Thursday evening, something Norman wasn't a fan of, but he was pressed to get a couple special ingredients for his dinner. He was having bow tie pasta that required basil pesto as well as parsley. The parsley was optional but if he was going to follow a recipe he was going to do it right. 

Norman made his way through the crowd and quickly grabbed his items. Taking the shortest possible route to the registers, Norman noticed the whisky aisle to his right. 

"I haven't had a good drink in......well over a year now." Norman thought to himself as he perused the shelf. 

"Why not!" Thought Norman as he bent down to grab a bottle of Evan Williams. Norman wanted to enjoy a drink, but he wasn't going to spend a lot of money. This was the alcohol Norman would drink every couple of weeks in college when he and his cousin would stay up late discussing philosophy. Norman knew it didn't have the best reputation, but to him it was all the same. 

As Norman got home, he quickly poured himself a small tumbler of Whisky as he started cooking.  After pouring he held the bottle at eye level to really examine it. 100 proof. 50% alcohol. With Norman's tolerance and love for all things in moderation, this bottle could last him for an extremely long time. 

As he sat down to tune into CSI for the evening, the alcohol had certainly hit him. Leaning back on the couch after cleaning up, with his dinner cooling off in the other room he gently stroked Norman's head. 

"This is nice. Nothing wrong with a drink every now and then is there buddy?" Norman said to Norman as he unintentionally drifted to sleep.

</thread><thread title=[Norman discovers /r/lifeofnorman] author=[RedLegionnaire] text=[It was another typical Saturday afternoon when Norman was snapped out of his placid daydreaming by the shrill tone of the Nokia theme, emanating from his cell phone.

Now, it was newer phone, but he had liked how cool and important the somewhat aggressive ringtone made him feel, so he had his son, who was a real tech wiz "hack" his current phone to have the jarring, descending melody.

Norman was excited, not only by the pulse pumping tune, but by the prospect of an unexpected phone call. He flipped the small, simple device open and uttered "H-hello?"

"Uh... hello. Norman, ehem, this is Lisa, from work..."

Norman's heart raced, was there some sort of work emergency that only he was capable of resolving? He wasn't sure he could handle the pressure. 

"I, uh... I saw something weird the other day on lunch break," Lisa confessed.

Norman relaxed slightly, but still, his mind raced as to what could possibly have been so important as to reach out to him on the weekend. "Oh, what's that?" He inquired.

"Look, I'll just send you a link, I still have your personal email." 

Norman thought for a moment, but then recalled that they had exchanged emails when they both were among those chosen at the office to arrange the holiday party; Norman was still proud of the rousing and bawdy event he had a hand in creating. There was still a punch stain on the floor by Johnson's desk!

"Just, please, give it a look. I'm sorry, I have to go" Lisa said with increasing cadence, before hanging up abruptly.

Norman assumed she must have had something important to tend to on her end, perhaps laundry. But he now had task in mind, and walked to the spare room where his reliable Dell sat, fans humming, the soft glow of it's indicator lights making the room feel less like a home office and more like a discotheque. He booted it up and got to work.
His home screen popped up; it was still unfamiliar to him, his son had installed something he called a "browser" last time he was over, even though Norman told him he was fine with just the "internet." He kind of missed clicking on the familiar blue "e". 

Norman typed "google" into the google search bar, and clicked "search." He still hadn't worked up the bravado to attempt "i'm feeling lucky."

The google page loaded dutifully, and Norman promptly typed AOL as his query, clicking the "search" button, careful to avoid the "lucky" button, once again.

He carefully observed the links, and found the AOL link his son had advised him about, something about the top most links being ads. He hoped he had clicked the right one.

"You've got mail!" the computer chimed.

"Success!" Norman thought to himself.

He combed through his new emails, there were seven. He started by clicking the oldest one, he didn't want to be rude to whoever sent it, and make them wait.

"Cheap RX Canadian warehouse pharma megadeals," Norman read, he opened the email and began to read. It was typical medical jargon he was sure was beyond his paygrade, but on the off chance they might have something cheap to take care of Norman's hairballs, he clicked the embedded link. The computer thought and thought, but nothing came up. Suddenly he remembered his curiosity had him on a mission - he eyed the remaining emails until he saw Lisa's username. The subject line simply said "lifeofnorman."

Norman opened the email. It contained only a single link, "www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman."
His curiosity was fully in control now, and he hovered his cursor over the link, when a shrill dinging came over the speakers. 

"Ding ding ding; Threat has been detected!"

Norman panicked, as he broke into a cold sweat. Was someone trying to hack him? He quickly and instinctively deleted Lisa's email, and exited the browser. For good measure, he turned off his computer and unplugged it as well. 

He'd have to check on those discount prescriptions another time.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5sm6wg/norman_discovers_rlifeofnorman/] createDate=[1486512188] score=[210] numComments=[18]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman has had enough.] author=[kaebal] text=[Norman sat at his desk at work, his eyes on the paperwork laid out before him, but his mind elsewhere. A mint chocolate cupcake was waiting for him in the office refrigerator. Norman didn't usually indulge in sweets like this, but yesterday had been his birthday. Allison, from HR, liked to keep track of everyone's birthday and always made sure to bring in cupcakes or even a full sized cake when someone in the office was working on their birthday.  
  
*An easy oversight to make*, Norman thought, as Allison hadn't brought in anything yesterday. *She is probably overworked as well.*  
  
After work last night Norman had walked to a cupcake shop that had been a bit out of his way. He was not fond of mint chocolate, and was hoping to get a plain vanilla with vanilla frosting, but the mint chocolate was all they had left. He decided he would save it for after his lunch at work the next day.
  
*Perhaps I should eat it now, in case someone mistakes it for their own cupcake.* It was only 11:15am and Norman knew it was unlikely that anyone would eat his cupcake, but he worried about it nonetheless. *I better just be done with it so I can focus on my work.*
  
Norman walked to the break room and retrieved his treat. It was a bit smooshed as Norman had to hide it in his coat to protect it as it started to rain on his walk home last night. Eating it reminded him of how little he cared for mint chocolate, but he was committed to enjoying this rare sweet.
  
“Happy Birthday!” Allison shouted as Norman returned to his desk, startling him. She was carrying a tray of vanilla cupcakes. “You’d thought I'd forgotten, didn't you Jim?” She said as she placed the tray down on Jim's desk. “Come on everyone, get a cupcake and wish Jim a happy birthday!” Allison announced to the office. Jim looked pleased.
  
Norman was glad that Allison had remembered Jim’s birthday, and the cupcakes did look good to Norman. *Better not*, he thought, as he sat back down to his paperwork. *I've had enough.*

</thread><thread title=[Norman tries Thai food] author=[USMC0317] text=[Around 4:00 PM Norman had a sudden realization that he had forgot to stock up on microwave dinners last time he was at the grocery store. Even though it was Friday, and it had been a pretty slow, uneventful day so far, Norman wouldn't be getting off work for another hour, and he certainly couldn't leave early. "I'll have plenty of time to stop at the store on the way home" Norman thought. He didn't want to miss his favorite Friday night TV show, which came on at precisely 6:00 PM. He sat at his desk pondering what he wanted for dinner tonight until it was finally time to leave and head to the store. As he was perusing the meals in the frozen section, he spotted an Amy's Kitchen Chicken Pad Thai. Feeling adventurous, he opened the glass door and removed the box from the freezer. He thought to himself "you've had a long week, you deserve to reward yourself." He turned the box over to check the nutritional information, which is when he noticed how much sodium was in the pad Thai. "Better play it safe" he thought, as he put the box back in the freezer, and grabbed his usual Lean Cuisine meatloaf. He made it home at 5:58 PM, just in time to settle in for his favorite show. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4abk3k/norman_tries_thai_food/] createDate=[1457956363] score=[203] numComments=[19]>

</thread><thread title=[The Joke] author=[lordperiwinkle] text=[Norman was in the supply closet at work, door ajar.  He was getting a new pen.  Just as he was about to leave he heard footsteps and voices.  The footsteps stopped near the partly open closet door.  His co-workers.  "Hey, I have a great joke for you!" said a hearty voice.   Craig.  Norman was not sure about Craig.  He always seemed so...*satisfied* with himself.  Norman wondered what always being satisfied with one's self felt like.  A couple of the women in the office certainly liked Craig.  Craig, with his crisp, curly hair, and his fast walk, and his hearty, cheerful, deep voice.  Norman sank back further into the shadowy closet, listening, waiting for his co-workers to return to their cubicles.  Craig launched into his joke. It was one of those long ones with much build up.  His co-workers were snorting bits of laughter even before it was finished.  The punch line came.  Much laughter, snickering, guffawing, giggling ensued.    Norman did not get the joke.  "ah, that was great!" said one. "Hey! Make sure you tell Norman!  He could use a good laugh!" said Julie.  Norman was fond of Julie.  She never treated him as if he was a non-entity.  "Aw, I don't know...does Norman even understand jokes? He doesn't seem the joking kind", said Craig.  "Just tell him." said Julie.

After they left, Norman hurried back to his desk, unnoticed.  In a bit, Craig approached.  While he was regaling Norman with the joke Norman worked at making a smile play around his lips, and burst into a laugh at the end.  "Oh!  That is Funny!" grinned Norman.  "I can hardly wait until tonight, when I can tell this to my best friend!"   "You have a best friend??" inquired Craig, somewhat amazed.  "Oh, yeah, he lives in my neighborhood", Norman replied.  "I've known him almost his whole life." Craig went away and Norman wondered why others thought the joke was so funny.  "I don't get it" sighed Norman to himself.

 That evening after Norman was home from work and his Hungry Man dinner was cooking in the oven, Norman told Norman about the joke.  He scratched Norman's silky ears and rubbed his soft cheek with his knuckle.  Norman told the joke, trying hard to give the same inflections that Craig had.  At the end Norman blinked his large green cat eyes at Norman, and tilted his head, pondering.  He did not get the joke, either.

<comment number=[11]author=[HansBrixOhNo]text=["No soap radio" is a form of practical joke and an example of surreal comedy. The joke is in reality a prank whereby the punch line has no relation to the body of the joke – that is, it is actually not funny – but participants in the prank pretend otherwise. The effect is to either trick someone unfamiliar with the prank into laughing along as if he or she "gets it" and/or ridicule him or her for not understanding.

<comment number=[12]author=[Rug_Rider]text=[I'm fond of the Norman not understanding the joke. Have you considered pointing out Norman's thought process in staying in the closet? For instance not wanting to be rude and interrupting the joke or internal quarreling for if it's too late to come out? It just appears as if he's sorta awkward/creepy to slink back into the closet. I think it was a nice touch to have him repeat the joke to Normal, aka his best friend. V cute]score=[2] </comment>
<comment number=[13]author=[lordperiwinkle]text=[I thought the staying in the closet bit showed how socially awkward he is.  He feels a bit intimidated by Craig, and did not want to pop out like he had been lurking.  Better he should wait for them to move on.  Not creepy, just shy.  I sort of think I write stuff that is too wordy so I tried to keep this shorter.  I was glad that he was able to tell Craig he had a best friend and let Craig think it was a human.  The idea for this popped into my head and it wrote itself, pretty much.  Thanks for liking it.]score=[5] </comment>

She had not been easy, her secret, inner workings teasing and frustrating in equal measure. And now it was nearly time. 

Norman leaned back in the metal folding chair, taking a slow deep breath. He could feel the hairs on the back of his neck bristle and a bead of cold sweat run down the small of his back. Willing his hand to stop shaking, Norman tried to calm his nerves. All this time, all this effort, all of Norman's pride came down to this one moment. 

Taking up the tweezers, Norman gingerly attached the minuscule  Ship's Bell to the mainmast of the 1:146 scale model of the U.S.S. Constitution. She was beautiful. Standing up from the his desk, Norman carefully picked up the model and walked across his study to place on the shelf with the other models. 

Later that evening, Norman got up from his recliner during a commercial break of an episode of CSI to fetch another mug of decaffeinated tea from the kettle. On his way, he stuck his head through the doorway of the study, admiring the model for the third time in the last hour. Norman smiled at the thrill of pride inside of him.

With each passing hour, he drank less, but after a few puppies passed gas he hadn't eaten anymore. Suddenly Norman saw Norman and said, "Tough Life".  Norman laughed moderately. Afterwards he licked his wounds.

The day was nice but humid. Unfortunately, nothing exciting happened. Except that afterward, Norman eliminated the constant headache that killed his productivity. Then, after waiting for hours, Norman looked like a new man.]score=[79] </comment>

<comment number=[32]author=[MattressCrane]text=[So! I can't respond to everyone, so I'll just write it here. Lots of good feedback. I'm glad I did this, because I was leaning more towards the second; the 2001 reference, if I were to pick from the list. However, from the statistics from the comments here, 0% of you agreed with me. So maybe it's for the best that I don't choose that one!

I think my decision is now this: None of the above!

The third one was one I was working on for a December month; which is a very gloomy one. However, I found a more talented artist to fill the boots for that one, so I scrapped my attempt; then thought about moving it over here. But it doesn't quite match the tone of the month of April either. So, not that one.

While I like the first one, and a lot of you too, but the problem with it is the colours. Chances are the book will have the images in black and white, and because of that, the first image does not transition well to a dulled canvas. So not that either.

I think, for April and for January, I'll lean towards minimalism and cartoonish style for Norman. While there is already 10 other images done, all in different styles, I do realize that none of the styles are quite... Dilberty, if you get what I mean. I'll see if I can get that done. ]score=[1] </comment>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Robs a Bank] author=[gumzilla] text=[Norman awoke feeling anxious. He had never done what he was about to do, but something unnatural came over him. Norman was ready to finally live life on the edge.                 

He pulled up to First National Bank and began walking towards the front doors. "It's now or never," mumbled Norman as he grabbed the door handle with his sweaty palm.                                                                
Norman got in line and pulled out the folded note from his pocket as he waited for the next available teller.                                                          
"Next." 

Norman cautiously approached the teller's window and slid the note, complete with his clear written  instructions, into her hands.

"I would like to withdrawal twenty dollars from Savings Account Number: 12816802, please."                                                
Norman knew he should keep that money in savings, but thought it was time to live a little.

"Maybe I could get another two cans of Coke," Norman thought.
          
The bank teller counted out the money and handed it to Norman. "Thank you for choosing First National, have a great day."

Norman folded the money into his pocket and walked towards his car. As Norman was sitting in the passenger seat he counted the money himself.

Norman counted twenty-one dollars. A sudden urge of guilt and worry swept over Norman. "Bank robbers end up in jail," Norman thought.                                                  
Norman hurried back into the bank and returned to the teller to tell her of the awful mistake. "I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to take the extra dollar," Norman remarked as he handed her the money.                         
The teller counted the money aloud once more. "One, two, three....twenty dollars. Sir, it's all here."

Norman became perplexed as he realized it was actually him who counted incorrectly.
                      
"Uh, uh it's okay, no withdrawl for me today," Norman blurted out as he turned and walked hurriedly towards the exit.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4iwqsm/norman_robs_a_bank/] createDate=[1463024847] score=[190] numComments=[16]>

Norman reached out and caught it between his thumb and forefinger. He carried it for a block or so and then gently let it drop on the sidewalk near some other leaves. The fallen leaves would eventually turn brown and make a satisfying crunching sound when he stepped on them.

When he heard of a great market in a town nearby, he excitedly got into his car on a sunny afternoon. 

It was a little nerve-wracking to go to a new place. It helped that the just right amount of breeze was coming through his window, and the sun wasn't burning his skin, it was actually the perfect amount of sunlight. It calmed his nerves as he continued to drive. 

After a bit of driving, he passed a sign, it had his name on it! His heart skipped a beat, not expecting to have to go through a town named "Norman," as that was his name too. He had a good chuckle after he passed the town, it was a nice and funny feeling to see such a quaint town with such a good name.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4jiobe/norman_goes_through_norman/] createDate=[1463385511] score=[190] numComments=[8]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman experiments with chemical substances] author=[missmaggy2u] text=[Norman was watching a special on television. It was one of those health documentaries, one that warns of the risks of addictive substances. The chemicals, the questionable additives, and even how they can lead to a changed lifestyle and the endless health risks. 

Yet, seeing them on his modest television set seemed to spark a craving he had long since buried. He began to think back to his younger days, when he occasionally dabbled in such things. 

Of course back then he was younger, more resistant. Whatever he felt, he could usually bounce back. And things weren't as bad for you back then, so they thought. Could his body handle these things as easily as it once did?

The craving began to become overwhelming, getting worse the more he thought about it. He knew where to get it. Every teenager did. The corner of Park and Wells, they had it cheap. 

When he returned home, there was no hesitation. Only devious excitement. He nearly burned himself.

Slightly startled, he glanced sleepily over at his bedside table and saw the faint glow of his phone screen, which was lying facedown atop an old TV guide.  A small wave of excitement rippled through him as he realized "I've just gotten a text!"  As he reached for his slightly outdated (but functional) windows phone, he wondered, "But who could be messaging me at this hour?"  Turning his phone over, he was blinded by a flash of light, as he had once again neglected to turn down the brightness of the screen before going to bed.  "They ought to fix that somehow" he said softly to no one in particular as he darkened the screen and typed "1234", unlocking the phone.  For a moment he forgot what he was doing, and while he was thinking, his phone buzzed again. Truly excited now, he checked his messages to find that it was only his wireless company reminding him that his bill was due in a week.

</thread><thread title=[Norman goes to an all-you-can-eat buffet] author=[tanzabonanza] text=[Norman was driving home from work one dreary Thursday afternoon when a neon sign he hadn't seen before flashed in the distance. As he got closer, he saw that the new restaurant they'd been building near Wal-Mart had finally opened. The sign advertised an all-you-can-eat buffet on Friday and Saturday nights. As usual, Norman didn't have any weekend plans so he thought maybe he would stop for dinner after work tomorrow. He'd never been to an all-you-can-eat buffet before. 

The next day at work, Norman spent his lunch break looking at the website for the restaurant. There was a list of all the foods included on the buffet and Norman carefully wrote down exactly what foods he wanted to get on each trip. He planned on pacing himself so he didn't get too stuffed and tired. He had two episodes of CSI recorded that he planned on watching when he got home. 

Finally, it was time! Norman got in his car and drove to the restaurant. He arrived at 5:15, and as it was still early in the evening, he was seated immediately. A young blonde waitress arrived to take his order. She let him know that the special that night was the all-you-can-eat buffet and that it was $14.99. Norman ordered an Arnold Palmer to drink since it was the weekend and told the  waitress he would have the buffet. She smiled and told him to go ahead and grab a plate from the stack and enjoy his dinner. 

He shuffled up to the buffet line and grabbed a plate. He consulted the note in his pocket detailing what food items to get. His first course was to be a salad. He piled on a small mound of iceberg lettuce, some cheddar cheese, and tomatoes. In another corner he added a small scoop of cole slaw. He wanted ranch dressing but he didn't see any and didn't want to be a bother, so he ladled on French instead. He found a cup for soup and poured himself a small bowl of chicken noodle. That would do for the first round. Nothing too filling right away. He made his way back to the table and sipped his beverage and began eating. 

Norman polished off the salad and cole slaw before eating the soup. He realized he had erred when his soup was just luke warm, but reasoned that he could always grab more on another trip. 

The smiling blonde waitress stopped by to ask how everything was and ask if she could take his plate out of the way. Norman froze. His eyes darted around at the other tables, but there weren't many to look at. As this was his first trip to an all-you-can-eat buffet, he wasn't sure if he was supposed to use the same plate or get a new one. He replied that he wasn't quite finished and that he would keep his plate for now. The waitress left the table. 

Nobody close by was having the buffet. Norman didn't want to look silly and do the wrong thing with his plate. He sipped his Arnold Palmer slowly. The waitress stopped by a few minutes later and asked if Norman was doing okay. He asked for the check. 

He paid his $18 tab and left an even 15% tip. He got in the car and drove home, his stomach rumbling. He didn't even like French dressing. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/55l9zo/norman_goes_to_an_allyoucaneat_buffet/] createDate=[1475485184] score=[179] numComments=[12]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman discovers rubber cement] author=[gerwer] text=[Norman went to Home Depot looking for a new light bulb for his fridge. The bulb in his fridge hadn't burned out; he only wanted to be prepared. 

Having secured the proper bulb, he headed for an exit, this time going through an unfamiliar aisle, which was rare for Norman. 

"Why not?" Thought Norman. 

Halfway through the empty aisle, Norman saw it. 

"Rubber cement? Is this some kind of joke? How can something be both rubber and cement?" Norman thought. 

Norman looked around, expecting to see either Allen Funt or Ashton Kutcher peeking at him from a distance, but he saw neither individual. Norman shook his head in disgust and left the Home Depot, vowing never to return. 

Norman went home, sat down, and Norman jumped on his lap. 

"Is Allen Funt even alive?" Norman asked Norman.

</thread><thread title=[Norman is late] author=[IDontItsCinnamon] text=[Through no fault of his own, Norman found himself waking to a much brighter lit sky than usual one morning. He quickly sat up and glanced at his alarm clock and, to his dismay, saw the red flash of "12:00" angrily blinking at him. 

"There must have been a power outage with last night's wind!" he shouted to Norman as he hurriedly jumped out of bed. He quickly grabbed the pair of pants he had worn the day before and pulled them on, trying to rub out the wrinkles as he ran to the closet to grab a clean shirt. He hurriedly pulled on a sweater, flattened down his hair in the mirror and picked up his cell phone to look at the time. 8:56! Four minutes to make a fifteen minute drive, and Norman knew it wasn't possible to make it on time. 

As he rushed out the door, practicing what he was going to tell his boss to explain his lateness, he heard a quick "mew!" and realized that he hadn't fed Norman. He stood in the driveway and began to panic. If he went back to feed Norman, it would take an extra two minutes at least, making him even later. But if he didn't, Norman would be hungry all day. So Norman quickly ran in the house, opened a can of Fancy Feast and set it down on the ground. Norman would just have to eat out of the can, there was no time to flake it in his dish.

On his commute to work, Norman remembered hearing that police wouldn't pull you over if you were only going 5 miles over the speed limit. So he set his cruise control to 50 rather than 45 and looked at the clock. 9:01. Late. He'd never been late before and his face turned bright red. This was going to be embarrassing. His pants were wrinkled, his hair disheveled, he'd forgotten his lunch and when he walked in, all eyes would be on him. 

At 9:09, he pulled into the parking lot and was surprised, then relieved to see there were no cars. "It's Saturday," he thought to himself. "Not late at all. In fact, I'm nearly two days early!" He chuckled to himself as he put his car in reverse and backed out of the parking lot. On the way home, he stopped at the market to get a bag of cat treats to apologize to Norman. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5asp9h/norman_is_late/] createDate=[1478151040] score=[180] numComments=[7]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Plays Skyrim: Special Edition] author=[ParadigmTheory] text=[Norman was enjoying a warm cup of medium dark roast coffee in his kitchen when he heard the knock on his door.

"It's too early for anyone to be awake to visit. It must be the mail," Norman remarked to himself.

Norman got up and walked to the front door, taking his coffee mug with him. He opened the door and instinctively looked at the porch, expecting mail. Sure enough, a small package was sitting there, and Norman spotted the UPS truck driving away in the distance. Norman picked up the package and closed the door

Norman finished his coffee and went to go find a knife. He was very careful to keep the blade pointed away from himself, as to not accidentally injure himself. He cut the tape on the package, and opened the box. Sitting inside was a small case, labeled "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition." 

Norman had ordered the game off of Craigslist about two weeks ago after his son had recommended it to him. Norman decided he would trust his son and try it out. He took the plastic wrapping off the case, opened it, and took the disc out.

Norman booted up his computer and put the game disc into the disc drive. It took awhile for the game to start, since Norman's computer was a few years old and wasn't quite powerful enough to run the game at full potential. When the game finally started, Norman noticed how slow it was running, even on the main menu. 

His cat, Norman, was sitting nearby, and Norman remarked to him, "Heh, what do you expect? My computer can barely run  Minesweeper as it is."

Norman clicked on "New Game" and sat back. The game was running slowly, but he was able to determine what was going on. He saw that he was bound up in a cart, sitting with 3 other prisoners. One of them talked about a rebellion, and how they were on their way to be executed.

Norman did not want to play a game where his character was branded as a criminal. With a sigh, Norman ejected the disc and turned off his computer. Putting it back in the case, Norman placed the case in his desk drawer.

"Maybe I'll see what's on TV instead," he said to himself.

</thread><thread title=[Norman gets self-conscious] author=[boobobaggins] text=[Norman's drive home from work was a little out of the ordinary: not only did he not get startled by the radio ad with the car horn in it today, but his journey home was sprinkled with rain. It wasn't enough rain to warrant the wipers going full speed, but was too much rain for the slowest speed: the windshield would get covered in raindrops by the next go-round of the wipers, and he couldn't have that. So Norman tried the second click. While it cleared the rain more to his satisfaction, the few drops that accumulated before being wiped again made him uncomfortable, so he clicked up to the third speed. 

"My wipers are going pretty fast for this light amount of rain," Norman said to himself. "This looks silly." But this speed cleared the windshield to his liking. He sat back into the seat, secure in his decision. Then another car drove past, and their windshield wipers appeared to be going slower than his. Not wanting to look like a worried old fool, Norman set his wiper speed back down a click.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4floer/norman_gets_selfconscious/] createDate=[1461155450] score=[178] numComments=[14]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman writes a Norman story] author=[jzigsjzigs] text=[Norman did a Yahoo search for "cats."  He found some amusing pictures, but he eventually stumbled across a forum where users shared funny stories about their cats.  He laughed at, and then pitied the cat who fell down the stairs after rolling around in cat nip.

Then Norman thought, I must have dozens of Norman stories as good as that.  

Norman sat at the keyboard for some time, thinking.  Should I use the story about the time he broke the lamp?  What about the time he almost caught the mouse, but ran into the wall?

Finally, he made a decision.

"I have a cat named Norman.  I am also named Norman.  One time Norman (the cat) had to be taken to the vet for his shots.  Norman (the cat) doesn't like to go the vet, and he especially hates shots.  So when I got him home I gave him a treat; a tin can of tuna.  Just before I got the can open, he scratched me across the lib, breaking the skin.  I retreated, and bandaged myself.  When I returned, I was treated with a nice snuggle.  I love Norman (the cat)."

Submit

Norman immediately noticed his error.  After frantically searching for an edit button, and not finding one, he deleted his post.  

Phew, that was close, he thought.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4r96os/norman_writes_a_norman_story/] createDate=[1467693887] score=[179] numComments=[10]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman encounters a mild inconvenience while looking for a bottle of water at Target.] author=[Rafikim] text=[Norman walked into the store, refreshed by the gust of cool air during this hot summer's day, and made his way around the cashiers' stands to those ever-present Coca-Cola coolers containing various beverages being sold at a high price just ever so slightly above the norm. Today, he was looking for a bottle of water.

Norman opened the first refrigerator he came across, and found not a bottle of water in sight. He pushed a few bottles of Fanta and Powerade around, and yet the cooler seemed to be fresh out of water.

Somewhat inconvenienced, as he had a dentist's appointment in just under an hour, and the water was the only item he planned on purchasing that day, he made his way to the next register line and peered inside that fridge. 

Yet again, there was no water to be found. Instead of wasting semi-precious time peering deeper into the depths of the cooler, Norman let out a heavy sigh and walked over to the next register's fridge. Luckily, the store was not crowded at all, so he was not disturbing the huge line that may be typical at any other time of day. 

This fridge, belonging to register seven, was not only out of water, but also Fanta and Coke as well. Norman found this mildly amusing, knowing that someone else, albeit looking for an entirely different product, might have also suffered the same inconvenience that he had. 

It was on the fourth refrigerator he tried that Norman declared victory. With a sigh of relief, he reached into the back of the cooler and pulled out a bottle of water. As the condensation began to form on the bottle as it came into contact with the warmer air of the department store, Norman made his way to the nearest open checkout lane, as the one in which he found the water was closed.

It was behind the elderly lady with far too many items that Norman decided to forsake his one-item rule for the day and buy a 14-pack of anti-cavity gum with the hopes to impress his dentist in about half an hour's time. 

Norman payed for the two items with a five-dollar bill, and donated the remaining $1.49 to the charity box sitting on the register. He had done his good deed for the day and acquired what he came for despite his challenges, and he walked out of Target with a smile. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4peymj/norman_encounters_a_mild_inconvenience_while/] createDate=[1466685182] score=[177] numComments=[10]>

I understand that he often gets into awkward situations, and we've all had the sticky apple sticker issue at some point. I understand that he's passive. But this is past my suspension of disbelief. You'd have to have a debilitating condition to give up on eating an apple due to the sticker "defeating" you.

</thread><thread title=[Norman Jr.'s Convocation] author=[baween] text=[Norman arose with a start when he heard the phone ring. Norman typically had few callers save for people ringing him up to do a survey or to ask if his fridge was still running. The cool plastic of the receiver felt heavy in his hand as Norman picked up the phone.

"Hello? Norman speaking."

"Uh...hey Dad." Norman Jr. hadn't called in months but Norman knew that his son was probably busy with all manner of schoolwork and he was glad that Norman Jr. made the time to talk to him. "I just wanted to let you know that I'm going to graduate at the end of term." Norman figured this would be happening soon - Norman Jr. had only three credits left before graduating, if Norman had kept track properly - but it was nice to simply hear his son's voice again. It was especially great because that meant Norman Jr. had passed his mandatory honors seminar - when they last spoke Norman Jr. was right in the thick of what sounded like a difficult class. 

"That's great, son! Congrats! When's the graduation ceremony?" Norman was already thinking excitedly of what to get Norman Jr. to mark the event. No mere gift card would do. He'd have to leave out some extra kibble for Norman or ask for someone in the building to take care of him. Maybe Gladys, the lovely old lady at the end of the hall could come in and check up on Norman? It was only an overnight trip but one could never be too careful.

There was a pause and a sigh on the other end of the line. "Well, Dad, see...here's the thing. We're only allowed two tickets each. Mom's going to be coming and...well...I didn't want to make things too awkward so I was going to give the other ticket to Randy..."

The sting from hearing that name slowed Norman's response as if he had taken a wiffle bat to the ribcage. "That's...that's okay, son." A pause and a sigh. "You do what you need to do. I'd love to come visit soon if you've got the time?" Norman was afraid that he sounded too upset.

"Yeah yeah, Dad!" said Norman Jr., "I'll hit you up when I've got a few days. Gotta jet, Dad. Nice talking to you! Later!" The phone went dead. Norman didn't know what a "hitting up" or "having to jet" meant, but he could send Norman Jr. his present in the mail.

At the very least Randy couldn't take Norman from Norman, he thought. It sounded like Norman Jr. was doing well, and wasn't that all that really mattered?

He's been locked out of the apartment since then and has no idea what to do, he'll eat anything right now! Oh how he wishes he can get back in it. 

After a few minutes of going around the block, could it finally be his lucky day? He sees a middle-aged man throw out a can of something into the alleyway facing his apartment complex. 

Norman instantly heads toward it and is quickly disappointed as he overlooks a small empty can of chef Boyardee mini-ravioli. His belly makes a rumbling sound, it feels like he heard this sound over 40 times today.

As he heads back to his apartment, he decides to go up the stairs to see if anything changed since the last time he has done so. Something is different though, the lights are on inside the apartment! What is going on?!

Norman cautiously approaches the front door and smells food that is cooking through the screen window. As he's embracing the smell, he sees a figure quickly look at him and rush toward him.

The figure opens the door and says "Norman! You're back! I thought you ran away! Oh my gosh, you must be starving, I was so scared I lost you" as he picks him up.

</thread><thread title=[Norman buys donuts for the office] author=[bstix] text=[It was holiday season at Norman's work and as usual Norman was covering the holiday shift. Thursday, Norman looked at the schedule and counted that only seven people would be in the office on Friday. 


On his way to work Friday morning Norman took a detour around the bakery and picked up a pack of 9 donuts. It was a better deal to get a full pack of 9 than to buy 7 individual donuts. Arriving at work in good time, he placed it in a cupboard the kitchen and got back to his desk. Before the rest of the team came in, he sat and composed an e-mail: "Dear colleagues, Please help yourself to a donut in the kitchen, Kind regards, Norman.". He didn't send it just yet.


Nobody suspected a thing, as he sat in his office working. Then finally at 10'o'clock, he couldn't resist anymore. Norman walked to the kitchen, got the pack of donuts, placed it on the table and opened it. He then hurried back to his office and clicked "Send" on his message. After a while, he received two replies: "thanks Norm" and "great way to start the weekend :)". Norman felt good.


--- 


Later on the same Friday, Norman sat at home in his couch, when suddenly it hit him that he forgot to take home the remaining donuts. How many was left? Did anyone get rid of them?


"Oh dear, I better get in early on Monday to clean up the mess." he said to Norman.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4u28w0/norman_buys_donuts_for_the_office/] createDate=[1469214541] score=[170] numComments=[11]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman gets friendly with Lisa] author=[USMC0317] text=[It was a normal Friday at the office, and Norman and Lisa found themselves together in the break room during their scheduled morning breaks. They talked about the weather, and the new copy machine the office recently acquired that doesn't jam every 7th page like the last one did. Norman always hated making copies on the old machine, but he didn't dare say anything to anyone. They talked about their pets, and Norman told Lisa about a documentary on pigs that he just watched, and that he thought she would like. He had it on DVD, perhaps she would like to stop by after work and borrow it from him, after all, it is Friday. Lisa thought that sounded like a great idea, she couldn't think of a better way to spend a Saturday than watching a riveting documentary by herself. Perhaps she would treat herself and buy a Totino's cheese pizza for lunch tomorrow, that would go great with a documentary, she thought. Break time was over, Lisa and Norman went dutifully back to work, putting ideas of pizza and documentaries out of their minds until later, they couldn't get distracted from their tasks. They went on as usual for the rest of the day, and at 5:00 o'clock, they parted ways. Norman had to hurry, Lisa would be there at 6:30 to pick up the DVD, and he still had to stop by the grocery store and pick up a meatloaf TV dinner. 

Just about the time Lisa showed up, Norman was lounging on the couch. She sat on the couch on the opposite end, excited about watching the documentary tomorrow. Norman slid a little closer to Lisa, trying not to be conspicuous. Lisa commented on how plush the couch was, she enjoyed that when she sat on it, she sunk right in. Norman slid even closer to Lisa, now sitting right next to her. He put his head on her lap, and she began to slowly stroke his hair. Norman was getting quite excited, he really enjoyed Lisa's touch. It was about that time that Norman walked around the corner into the living room, holding the pig documentary DVD, and saw Norman sitting on Lisa's lap, purring. Lisa took the DVD, thanked Norman and Norman, and went on her way. Norman popped his meatloaf meal in the microwave, and settled in on the couch with Norman just in time to watch CSI. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/57niq8/norman_gets_friendly_with_lisa/] createDate=[1476586793] score=[170] numComments=[6]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman's Staff Meeting] author=[Chrdav65] text=[Norman’s palms were sweating, his forehead drenched. Today wasn’t a typical staff meeting in which Norman could sit quietly and listen to the weekly building and program updates.

Norman was always careful to be attentive as possible during these meetings. Whenever he and his Supervisor’s eyes met, Norman would nod appropriately to what was being said to indicate he agreed with and understood the information being shared.

But this week Norman took over the hire report which was previously handled by his co-worker, Cindy. He spent most of Wednesday and Thursday being trained about his new assignment by Cindy, making note of the deadlines and processes. 

Norman thought back to 5pm, Thursday afternoon: 

*** "Thanks for all your help." said Norman.

“You’re welcome Norman, just make sure you let everyone know to send you the hire information during staff meeting on Friday.” replied Cindy. ***

Norman couldn’t get that last exchange out of his head since. Norman’s supervisor walked in and the meeting began. His mind wandered, Norman felt badly that he couldn’t pay attention as usual.

“Finally, the new hire report will be now completed by Norman and not Cindy. So make sure you send him the information on the last day of every month.”

Relief stuck Norman like never before; he wouldn't have to speak in front of everyone. He regained his composure and nodded at his supervisor. After the meeting Norman sat at his desk, briefly looking at a photograph of Norman Jr as his heart swelled with pride and confidence. Maybe he would give his son a call after work to see if he had any weekend plans.

Chuck, from across the water cooler, said, "Hey Norman, did you see the new intern they brought in?" with a slight grin and two distinct raises of his eyebrows.

Norman certainly had seen her. He briefly thought of replying to Chuck by saying, "If I was twenty years younger...", but quickly nixed the idea. He thought to himself "better to have a job than the admiration of one's peers."

"I sure did, Chuck. She seems nice."

</thread><thread title=[Norman says no] author=[Kerrigore] text=[Norman was out for his usual Saturday walk. He always walked the same carefully planned and timed route, because he wanted to make sure he would get back in time for CSI. 

It was a pleasant route, and the only qualm Norman had about it was that it passed by the nearby liquor store, and sometimes there were unsavory types hanging around the vicinity. But Norman merely kept his eyes fixed firmly on the sidewalk as he walked by, and that had always served him well.

This particular Saturday, however, that changed.
"Hey, excuse me!" came a high pitched voice from behind Norman.
Norman turned around to find a teenage girl standing behind him, her two friends standing nearby watching and giggling. She had dark skin and dark hair, and was sucking on a red lollipop while eyeing Norman speculatively. Without waiting for a response, she asked "Can you do me a favor?"

Norman was conflicted. His first instinct was to say "Sure!", and he even opened his mouth to say this before a second thought hit him and he hesitated. His next instinct was to say "Depends on what it is.", but that seemed very rude and presumptuous. 'What if she just wants directions, or to borrow my phone to call her parents for a ride?' thought Norman to himself.

However, the girl must have taken his silence for assent, because she continued "Can you boot for me?"

Norman was momentarily confused, until he remembered a conversation he had overheard between Norman Jr. and one of his friends wherein it was clear that this was a slang term for an adult buying alcohol for a minor.

"No, sorry" blurted out Norman, and immediately spun around and continued along his route. For a few moments he wondered if he should have warned the staff at the liquor store, or tried to explain to the girls the dangers of underage drinking? But no, it was best to steer clear of the whole situation. He couldn't wait to get home and tell Norman all about it.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4khdja/norman_says_no/] createDate=[1463924968] score=[164] numComments=[9]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Pushes the Envelope] author=[TheOwlAndTheFinch] text=[When checking his mail one sunny day, Norman found an unusual letter in his box. It wasn't unusual in color or shape, of course; Norman found it unusual because he expected to encounter only four pieces of mail, and here was a fifth! It was quite thick, and for a moment Norman had a rush of excitement at the thought of opening it. Before this dream came to fruition, however, he noticed that, while the address was correct, the name on the envelope was actually Lisa's. He chuckled to himself. Yet another company newsletter had swapped their addresses, despite the complaints they had both filed. (Complaint was a strong word, Norman mused. He wasn't actually perturbed by the incident, but "complaint" was the word on the top of the form, so "complaint" it was.) 

"It's a nice day," Norman told Norman.

Silence. 

"I think I'll take a walk and put this into Lisa's mail slot myself." He said, a bit louder this time. The cat still did not respond. It was clear that the feline Norman had no opinion on the matter, so, after changing into a slightly older pair of khaki's (in case the wind kicked up and they got dirt on them), he departed. 

After knocking on Lisa's door several times, he came to the conclusion that she must be out. He bent over to stick the letter in the mail slot when an unusual thing happened- the letter wouldn't fit! It made sense to Norman, because the envelope truly was large, and perhaps the mail slot was on the small side as well. He had come all this way, however, and wasn't going to give up. He struggled with the sizing issue for a few seconds before the overstuffed A4 envelope reluctantly gave in. Norman was pleased with himself, and hoped that the contents were not too bent when Lisa opened them.

"Sorry I'm late," Norman told Norman as he walked through the door. Indeed, he was a good five minutes later than he had previously anticipated, and feline Norman was sitting by his food bowl impatiently. 

"The letter didn't fit in the mail slot, so..." At that very moment, he realized the perfect opportunity for a joke. It was something his son would have called a 'dad joke', but Norman thought this one was so clever that more than just *dads* would appreciate it.

"I guess you could say I was..." He paused one more time for effect. 

"*pushing the envelope*."

He guffawed so loudly that he accidentally spilled a few bits of the dry kibble he was scooping into the bowl.

Yes, that would leave Norman very confused.

------
Norman wasn't sure what to think or do after hearing Norman make sounds that seemed to be English words instead of mere cat noises (not to be confused with "meerkat noises," something Norman had spent one morning enthusiastically researching at the local library where he had run into LeVar Burton quite literally but said nothing more than "Oh my I'm so sorry," not having any idea who he was). He simply stood blinking for a few seconds, until he looked at the clock and saw that those few seconds actually were several minutes and that Norman was no longer even in his field of vision, as he had sauntered off to bathe himself casually as he muttered to himself about the poor quality of television these days. Even amid Norman's confusion about mere cat noises and language, he was able to eke out the thought that it was strange for Norman to remark upon TV things, as Norman had never owned one. He scratched his head wondering how he had ever watched CSI though, if that were the case... and then continued on wondering what Norman could possibly have been talking about in his strange cat-like way of being able to mutter disgruntled things while licking his hamstrings. Then he heard Norman say something about it always being the same show about the same 92 cars... Half of them would go in one direction early in the day, and then several hours later exactly the same number of identical cars would speed by in the opposite direction.

Norman realized Norman was conflating windows with TVs, and suddenly he felt as though it all made sense: Norman simply hadn't understood his clever joke, and that's okay.]score=[5] </comment>

The book is broken down into months, following one year in Norman's life. What I'm planning on doing is having an illustration before each month, highlighting the tone and stories for that specific month.

So, what I ask if you guys, if you're interested in giving this a shot, please either PM me or link some of your artwork here in the comments; give me an idea of your skill level. I would have it more open, but honestly, that never works. So show me a bit of your talent and let's talk!

Also, there's something else! I'm recreating the CSS for the subreddit here. I already have the layout finished, but what I need now is a large image for the background. I'd like it to be a mural of sorts, of items and objects related to Norman.

<comment number=[16]author=[MattressCrane]text=[I think this is something that might bother people about the book. Because the book consists of 365 stories about Norman, in a chronological order, I had to set some things that are canon. So I do have to set some set rules.

</thread><thread title=[Norman gets a free coffee] author=[Dascancer] text=[It was late in the morning and Norman was feeling like he needed a coffee for no reason in particular. On his way to the small cafe version of a popular chain restaurant, he noticed a man was going to beat him to the self serve coffee machine. Norman quickly changed direction to a nearby water fountain for a sip to allow the man first access to the small stand.

As the man went to pay for his coffee, Norman moved in for his. He heard the man ask the attendant for another cup as he forgot to put cream in his cup, and wanted to ensure the creamer machine didn't splash his current cup everywhere and make a mess. 

Not missing a beat, Norman offered to take the man's coffee as he liked his black anyway. It was not until that moment that Norman noticed the man was a pilot. The pilot was so glad to have someone offer a solution to his predicament that he offered to pay for Norman's coffee.

Norman wanted to get a muffin, but was not one to push his fortunate situation, and walked back to his seat in the airport with his nice warm cup. He was flying to LA for a conference and the pilot was his own.

</thread><thread title=[Norman Finds YouTube] author=[rcgy] text=[Norman wasn't exactly technologically inclined. He took great pride in the fact that he wasn't using a flip phone, but truth be told, his Motorola Droid was barely better. 

One day, Norman accidentally opened one of the apps which was sectioned off as "Junk". Or at least, would be if Norman knew how to. 

The app opened up, and after a minute, the tiny screen displayed a website which Norman hadn't seen before. Squinting, Norman tapped haphazardly at the screen, holding the phone away, crinkling his nose as if Norman had had too much wet food, and jabbed away contentedly, trying to find how to exit the application. 

A video started playing, and Norman stopped jabbing, to watch the little boy sit in the car, speaking strangely, rolling his head around. Norman was initially concerned, but then realised the boy had just been to the dentist, and stopped watching the video to check his calendar for when his next appointment was. 

By the time Norman got back, the video had stopped playing. Norman couldn't figure out how to get out of the program, so he put the phone in the drawer where it belonged. A fluffy mouse in the drawer caught Norman's eye, and he remembered that he was getting a toy for Norman to play with. 

Reaching into Norman's toy box, Norman thought that it would be excellent if there was a place for people to post videos of their cats online. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/55i9s8/norman_finds_youtube/] createDate=[1475444755] score=[154] numComments=[1]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman's Sky.] author=[BooRadleyBoo] text=[Norman was nervous. The delivery of his package was due any moment. He'd taken the day off work in order to be there to sign for it. He didn't want to bother his neighbours, not that he had ever communicated with them beyond tucking his lips in, and lifting his head and eyebrows in unison.

He had followed the progress of the delivery online and according to the courier's website the package was in town. He boiled the kettle and stared out the kitchen window at the steam vent on the building opposite. What he wouldn't give for a view...the buzzer buzzed. Norman jumped and knocked the empty mug into the sink, breaking its handle. He'd forgotten just how loud and jarring the buzzer was.

He spoke over the intercom with the delivery man in short, concise sentences and remotely opened the door to the building. Norman was ringing his hands in nervous anticipation as he curled his toes repeatedly inside his slippers. Moments later there was a knock on the door.

Norman opened the door and the delivery man thrust an electronic device and a stylus towards him. Norman scribbled something approximating his signature with the unresponsive technology as instructed. The delivery man bent down and lifted up the box, and handed it to Norman. The exchange complete, Norman looked at the inconspicuous box as the delivery man's footsteps clicked away down the corridor.

Norman, still looking at the box, turned and closed the door with his foot. He walked into the TV room, not noticing his cat acrobatically leap away from his foot fall. He placed the box in front of the TV  and knelt beside it. He carefully cut along the seam of the tape and opened the lid. Inside he saw white Styrofoam, and bubble-wrap; he'd enjoy popping that over breakfast this weekend. Hidden among the static and plastic was the black box he'd been so impatiently waiting for.

He removed his home gaming console and followed the instructions closely, hooking it to the television. Norman had not owned a home console since his Atari 2600. Of course, his peers had all owned SNESs or Megadrives but Norman loved his Atari 2600. He reined supreme in Centipede; largely because his peers were more interested in Sonic, or Mario.

Norman waded through the set-up screens, creating an account he felt he didn't need. After an hour of faffing he loaded the game he had bought the black box for. 'No Man's Sky'. Norman created his character profile and began his journey into a new universe; one where many thousands of others like him would be roaming the great dark in seek of...something.

Weeks passed and Norman had spent an inordinate amount of his spare time immersed in his new universe. His character currently stood on a cliff's edge overlooking a lake, on a barren rocky planet. The atmosphere was toxic with acid rain a regular feature. He had more than enough elements in his slots. He wasn't sure what he should do.

He had initially hoped he would bump into avatars of other users online, and perhaps begin an adventure where they'd travel through space together, fighting pirates, and bonding with each other as their adventure progressed. He knew that this was statistically unlikely to happen but at one point he did have hope. However, it became clear from videos he watched while at work that there were no other real users to encounter. He was alone in the universe.

Norman's avatar stood facing out across the barren world as the acid rain storm raged around him. "Life support critical" the game warned him. Norman sighed.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/504yqp/normans_sky/] createDate=[1472505672] score=[147] numComments=[6]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman shops online] author=[lbridgey] text=[Norman smiled and sat back in his chair, finally finished.  He had just spent the better part of his evening shopping online for a new toaster oven.  It was smooth sailing at first and he was able to narrow down the options quickly to the five top rated ovens.


Two were much too large and fully-featured.  Despite a sale that would make the nicest model also one of the cheapest, Norman knew he would never use a dedicated pizza drawer and he didn’t want more oven than he might need.  The third he just didn’t like the shape of.  With it’s domed top and rounded glass door, Norman was afraid he’d be making too much of a statement.  He preferred rectangular ovens with clean corners.  Painstakingly, he read reviews and watched unboxing videos of the final two.  Both were popular and looked nice, but one had an extra half star, while the other had about an extra 500 ratings.  ‘Why wouldn’t more people buy the better one?’ he puzzled to himself.  Nevertheless, he decided that the larger group must know something he didn’t.  Not wanting to risk being the odd man out, Norman settled on a very nice, mid-range oven with 4/5 stars.


He held his breath and added it to his Amazon Wishlist.  Norman didn’t need a toaster oven today, but perhaps someday soon.  In the meantime, he knew that if anyone were to ask, he’d be ready with a fine recommendation.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5e5wl2/norman_shops_online/] createDate=[1479784754] score=[149] numComments=[5]>

<comment number=[5]author=[jzigsjzigs]text=[This is incredibly similar to my first Norman story, [Norman's Friday night](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/35s6fl/normans_friday_night/).

Edit:  I decided to list the similarities.

-Norman is watching the clock in anticipation for the end of his work day.

-Norman is expecting a shipment of his favorite forensics show.

-Norman is disappointed because he doesn't receive that shipment.

-Norman settles on watching reruns instead.

It's basically the exact same story, same plot points.  I'm not accusing OP of ripping me off, but it is eerily on point.

Then again, it's not necessarily the most original story, so who knows.  I'm giving OP the benefit of the doubt.

</thread><thread title=[Norman takes a walk] author=[Thunder_54] text=[Saturday 7:30AM. Norman always allowed himself an extra thirty minutes of sleep on the weekends when he didn't work. Normally, after waking up, Norman would make breakfast and read the newspaper. But not today

Earlier this week Norman overheard a co-worker talking about an article in Men's Health that said "Just half an hour of walking is good for heart health!". Not wanting to be unhealthy, and acknowledging his family's history of heart attack, Norman decided he should try something new. 

Wearing his grey sweatpants, he found a CD mix he had made 5 years ago in an old CD case. He put it in his CD player and stepped outside into the crisp sunrise morning. This first song was a good one. The neighborhood was quiet and Norman quite enjoyed his ability to walk in time with the song without feeling self-conscious. 

Finally he made it to the end of the block. His heart rate was up and Norman was feeling the blood flow and even humming along with the song.

As he made a right turn in a perfect power-walk stance the song changed. 

"True" by Spandau Ballet.

The shadow of painful memories suddenly gripped Norman's conscience. This was *their* song. 

"Maybe that's enough walking for today" thought Norman. He shuffled home with no music.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4i0qkb/norman_takes_a_walk/] createDate=[1462495350] score=[149] numComments=[10]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Goes Green] author=[theycallmechell] text=[It was a rather eventful weekend for Norman as he entered his local clothing store. Typically, Norman would’ve preferred spending his weekend like every other – spending time with his cat, perusing the internet for rare coins, and watching TV. However, “Go Green” week at work was coming up where everyone could show their support for protecting the environment. Casual Monday’s theme asked that everyone where a green t-shirt. In spite of his reservations, Norman concluded that supporting the environment was a good cause. Plus, he thought it would be nice to add a little more color to his wardrobe.   

Habit lead Norman left, towards the plaid collared-shirts aisle. But as he continued, something caught his eye. Norman cautiously entered the section labeled “Young Adults”, as if entering an area where he was not allowed. Presented on one of the front racks was a dark green shirt with the words “Go Green” bolded below a peculiar looking flower. Norman knew of many flowers, but this one was unfamiliar to him. As he continued to rack his brain on what type of flower was on the shirt, a store assistant approached him. 

“Can I help you with something?” the assistant asked.
 
Startled, Norman glanced up at the tall, slender young man - presumably in his twenties - who bore an amused smirk.

Embarrassed for shopping at a section where he felt he most certainly didn’t belong, Norman grabbed the shirt and tucked it behind his back.

“No thanks, I’m fine,” Norman muttered and walked a little faster than he would’ve liked towards the register. 

Much to Norman’s chagrin, he left the store with a shopping bag in hand containing a new shirt. When he got home, he decided it would be best to start a list of other clothing stores he could shop at in the future, knowing he could never show his face at that one again. At least he had a shirt to wear to work on Monday. 

Norman was sent home early on Monday. It was his first time being called into any superior’s office in his working career, and out of sheer fear forgot most of the encounter. However, as Norman ran and reran the events of the meeting on his drive home he remembered his supervisor mention the word “Cannabis” and how he was sending him home for being “Too Casual.” Whatever that meant, Norman concluded it would be best to not participate in any work events for awhile.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4r3600/norman_goes_green/] createDate=[1467599523] score=[150] numComments=[4]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Goes to the Restaurant] author=[TheDormHermit] text=[It was the end of the month. To Norman’s delight, he went under budget this month. To celebrate, Norman took himself a few blocks away to an inexpensive restaurant he occasionally went to.


While Norman waited to be seated, he alternated between pretending to text someone and subtly trying to catch the attention of the wait staff. The waitress approached him.


“One?” she asked.


“Yes,” Norman smiled politely. She led him to a table at the corner, which he was grateful for.  Norman carefully read the entire menu, even though he has always gotten the mac and cheese at this restaurant. From behind the menu, he peeked at the nearby table, where a group of younger people were sharing a plate of nachos with chili.


*That looks good,* thought Norman. He read “Nachos with Chili” again on his own menu. “Made with black beans, ground beef, tomatoes and black peppers,” it said underneath. Norman did not have a problem with any of these ingredients. 


Norman considered getting nachos. He could not remember the last time he had nachos.


“Sir, are you ready to order?” the waitress approached him again.


“The mac-and-cheese please,” Norman blurted out. He did not want to keep her waiting.


The mac-and-cheese was not bad, but it was not as good as the last time Norman had it, nor was it as good as the time prior to that. Norman made a promise to himself that he will try the nachos with chili next time.

She seemed a little distracted when he talked, looking at other people and things, but Norman didn't mind. He understood that sometimes movements and noises were distracting. Norman didn't even mind when Debbie came over and said hi to Lisa and they started to chat. Norman decided just to trail off. He didn't want to say anything and make it awkward. Debbie left after a minute.

When it was Lisa's turn to talk, Norman focused politely on her face, though he did glance away when their eyes met. She seemed interested in what she was saying. She mentioned something that Norman knew was inaccurate. He began to open his mouth, but then brushed it off, pretending that it was a cough. He felt bad when people corrected him. He didn't want to make Lisa feel bad.

Later, Norman went home and petted a sleeping Norman, but the cat grumbled threateningly and rolled over. Norman decided not to bother Norman. It was the least he could do. He preferred to keep others happy, even when they didn't usually notice it.

When Norman went to bed that evening, he wished that Norman was there to cuddle him. He didn't want to get up, though. He told himself that he didn't want to force the cat to do something he didn't want to do, but really, he was just too tired.

</thread><thread title=[Norman Encounters his High School Band] author=[MattressCrane] text=[It was late in the evening, Norman decided to head out to The Pub for a bite to eat. Sure, they had good beers available, but Norman wasn't a big beer drinker. He was a bigger fan of their dish, “Mount Nachos.”

As Norman sat at a bar-stool, happily eating his nachos, a band was starting to set up their instruments on the small stage in The Pub. The band members were all older men, somewhere in their forties, and each grunted and groaned excessively as they positioned their drum set, electric guitar, and bass guitar. Then a realization came over Norman.

This was his band from high-school.

It had been many decades, but Norman still remembered the band very clearly. Norman and the three men setting up on stage started a band in the 11th grade, called The Dusty Knucklers, and their specialty was hard rock. First there was Roger, the bass player. Back in the 80's, Roger was a heavy rocker, took style cues from David Bowie, and had a soft spot for Matilda, the bands muse. Norman had wondered where Matilda ended up after high-school. He had also wondered where Roger ended up as well- but it was answered for him this very night. Roger's hairline, as well as Tyler and Deacons, had fared well. The show began to start.
"Hello everyone, thanks for coming tonight!" started Roger. He wiped the sweat from his forehead to slick back his long hair. Norman slicked back his hair as well, and wiped the excess sweat from his hand onto his pant-leg. "We're the Wet Knucklers, and we hope you all have a good night. Party hard."

The old band started to play their songs; songs that Norman recognized well. The difference in the songs however, was the lack of Norman's keyboard. Norman wondered if he would still remember how to play a keyboard as well as he did then. It had been so many years…

After an hour of playing, The Wet Knucklers put down their instruments and headed for the bar. Norman's heart began to pound intensely. *Would they recognize their old friend?*

The three men took a seat beside Norman. Norman's plate was clean. The band ordered a few beers.
"You guys did great tonight!" cheered the bartender. As a bonus, he lined up shots for them.

Tyler smiled. "Thanks mate. Always appreciate the compliments."

"So," started the bartender, "You play hard rock, but no one on the keyboard? Seems like a missed opportunity."

"We used to have an keyboard player," said Roger, solemnly, "back when we started the band. But we vowed to never have another one again. Not after Norman."

Norman's heart sank. *Did they really not like me?*

"Why not? Did the guy just suck?"

Roger gulped down his beer, shaking his head as he swallowed. "Not at all. He was a great player. But one day he left the band and... well... he died."

"How did he die, if you mind me asking?"

"We heard it was from a heart attack. That happened about a year out of high school... I don't know, mate. It just doesn't feel right to replace him; you know?"

"I understand." said the bartender sympathetically. "Here- let me get you another round of shots."

The bartender poured another row of shots for the band. Everyone was silent- including Norman. Who said he was dead? Did no one look into it? Did everyone from his childhood assume he died?

"For Norman." said Tyler.

"For Norman." said Deacon.

"For Norman." said Roger.

Norman wanted to say something- anything- but he couldn't find it in him. A tightness in his chest stopped him from being able to say a word. He hoped they might recognize him, that they would do him the favor of starting the conversation, but he knew it was hopeless. He looked like a completely different person since high school. He looked like his father. As the band went back up to play a second set, Norman paid his bill and left.

Norman went home, humming the band's old songs.

</thread><thread title=[Norman gets hit on] author=[PizzaWithKetchup] text=[It was a Friday evening. Debbie asked Norman, "hey, can you you finish the last few files on my desk? I gotta go pick up my son from daycare. Thanks sweetie!" as she left abruptly. 

Norman automatically agreed. He doesn't like doing it, but respects that she has duties like picking up of her child from daycare. He tells himself "It's only every few Fridays that Debbie asks me" and "Her poor son is waiting at the daycare as late as 7:00PM, I want them both to be happy. It's Friday after all". 

This particular Friday, Debbie left Norman a lot of files. Before he knew it, he looked outside and it was pitch black. The janitor could be heard outside cleaning with a loud machine. He looked at the time and it said 9:20PM. "Gosh darnit" he thought. At least he finished the files. 

As he was walking outside of the office with his briefcase, toward the subway, he was stopped by a woman. 

"Hey there, I like the way you look" said this woman smoking a cigarette and wearing a miniskirt and tube top. She even gave him a wink.

Norman blushed and felt tingly. His heart even skipped a beat. "Wow, this is actually happening?" he thought as he knew this was some sort of flirting. The last time this happened to him was probably when he met his ex-wife, and even then, it was to a much lesser extent. 

Before he could mumble something, she said "how about you and me have a little fun? 80$ and you can do anything you want babe".

Norman's face went white. He thought that this only happens in movies! He knew what this girl is!

"N-n-no thank you mam, I gotta head to work" he responded as he  quickly walked toward the other subway station. He knew that he had to do the right thing, and that what she wanted was illegal.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4kko10/norman_gets_hit_on/] createDate=[1463982208] score=[137] numComments=[16]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman takes a risk] author=[gnome_census] text=[It's a weekday, and as usual Norman has woken up at early so he can have a nice relaxing morning before work. 

Norman sits at his desk with a steaming bowl of plain oatmeal, opens his laptop and sets about putting the finishing touches on a inventory report his boss had requested. He scrolls through, checks for errors, making sure the figures are correct.

A smile plays on his lips as he highlights the text and changes the font from Times New Roman to Comic Sans. He chuckles to himself and thinks 'What if?' and then changes it back. 

Soon enough, after checking and rechecking the report several times, he saves it to the 500 MB flash drive his son had mailed him for his birthday last year, and closes the file. 

Norman checks the time. He has 22 minutes before he has to leave. 'A perfect amount of time for a game of Solitaire' he thinks to himself. Maybe today will be the fateful day he finally wins. He quietly clicks on the pixelated cards and finishes his oatmeal.

But alas, today was not the day. Norman checks his watch and stands up to head out the door. 

He turns to head out. 

But turns back when he realizes he has forgotten the drive with report on it. He leans over his desk, squinting at the computer screen, and clicks the 'Safely Remove Hardware' icon to eject 'Norman' from the port. 

He waits for the computer to respond.

And he waits.

'C'mon. C'mon C'mon' 

A bead of sweat rolls off his forehead and settles between his furrowed brows. 

He anxiously checks his watch. He's a minute late, and still no message from the computer.

He clicks several more times, his eyes nervously darting between the screen and his watch, shaking as he feels the adrenaline course through him.

Finally he can wait no longer, he closes his eyes and scrunches his face in a pained expression, and slowly pulls the flash drive from the port like the last Jenga block. He grips it tightly in his fist, says a quick prayer to no one in particular, and rushes out the door.  ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/58307o/norman_takes_a_risk/] createDate=[1476814090] score=[136] numComments=[8]>

Norman had a pretty stressful day at the office; Debbie leaving three files for him to complete before storming off didn't make it any better. 

He took off his shoes, put the paper bag with food in it on the table by the sofa, and went to wash his hands.

Upon returning, he sat comfortably in the reclining chair, one of the only things he got to keep when his wife left him.

As it was time to finally relax, Norman pushed the on button of the remote control and the television flashed open to a car advertisement and the channel number in the top right corner. "Ah, commercials, better dig into dinner" Norman thought to himself as he unwrapped his semi-cold double cheeseburger; a treat he felt that he deserved after this crazy day.

As he took his second bite, the commercials ended and the show resumed. After the "viewer discretion is advised" message, a deep voice, a deep voice that was narrarting said "Now as the cows are hanged from the hooks...." as graphic video content of a slaughterhouse played in the background. On top of the History Channel logo, white text said "PETA presents: Animal Cruelty". 

Norman, a bit perplexed as he was not expecting the History Channel to show anything like this, stared at the television for a good few seconds.He looked at his burger knowing that it is made from the same animal he sees being killed, and then looked back at the television.

"Gross" Norman mumbled to himself. He put down the burger and wiped his hand with the brown napkin in the bag. He then took the remote, and changed channel until something better was on.

He stopped to a channel that was 20 minutes into The Breakfast Club movie. Norman was relieved. He took a bite of his burger; he felt better now that he could resume eating his dinner without feeling grossed out and guilty.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4l2l7w/norman_is_cruel/] createDate=[1464249158] score=[131] numComments=[4]>

He got ready and went to work as usual. In the office no one said anything to him about his birthday. He wanted to make a subtle remark about it being his birthday, so somebody  would notice and say it and start a chain reaction of everyone wishing him a good birthday. But he decided it to be too vain and went almost the whole day normally, until an hour before closing when he popped into the bosses office to ask if he could  leave since he had birthday plans. The boss replied "sure, should have taken the whole day norm". Norman got his things and went home. He didn't have any plans.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/52n8m5/norman_has_a_birthday/] createDate=[1473833331] score=[133] numComments=[6]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman discovers technology] author=[sensicle] text=[Norman overhead a conversation near the water cooler at work:

"I ended up using Google Maps to look up the bus route and it showed me the exact schedule, down to the minute!" Ross exclaimed to the intern.

*Google Maps*, Norman wondered. *I think I have that app.* Not wanting to use his phone during work hours, Norman anticipated exploring the app during lunch.

At noon, shortly after finishing his tuna sandwich, Norman sat quietly on a bench outside his office. The sun was shining bright but the cool, subtle wind made Norman feel good about having worn a sweater that day. 

He wiped his hands together briskly and removed his phone from his pocket. He saw the app and launched it, holding the phone in his right hand. After poking around a bit and entering a destination (he chose El Paso, Texas since it seemed really far), he discovered how to get there by bus. He smiled, appreciating the science and technology that made that moment possible. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/57lq60/norman_discovers_technology/] createDate=[1476561196] score=[129] numComments=[6]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Almost Spoils Himself] author=[ConquistDelTaco] text=[Norman woke up 5 minutes before his alarm was set to go off in the morning. After briefly pondering whether or not he should close his eyes for a short while longer, he decided to get an early start to the day.

"The early bird gets the worm", he chuckled to himself.

He engaged in his usual morning routine, and although it was not intentional, he found himself noticeably ahead of schedule - much more so than one would anticipate from waking up a few minutes early.

An idea crept into Norman's mind, and he began to toy back and forth with the idea of stopping at the local coffee shop near his work to buy a coffee, instead of simply grabbing one from the break room at the office. He knew it wasn't the most financially viable of decisions, but it was a Friday after all, and it had been a long week.

As he weighed in on the pros and cons of his decision during his commute, he was stopped by a red light. This was odd to Norman, as he realized this light was always green for him on his drive to work. He frowned slightly, worried about the time it left for him to go to the coffee shop.

Norman arrived at the coffee shop and found a parking spot, which he backed into so that he could pull out of it upon leaving. He'd always found this to be a much safer method for maneuvering in a parking lot. Before exiting his vehicle, he glanced inside and noticed how busy it was. Although he was still earlier than usual on his way to the office, he couldn't help but wonder if the wait time inside would cause him to be late.

"Perhaps I'll save this for another day", he thought.

Norman cautiously pulled out of his parking spot and proceeded to head to the office - disappointed about the coffee, but also quite pleased that he would be getting a jump start on his work.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5xaz96/norman_almost_spoils_himself/] createDate=[1488584113] score=[126] numComments=[7]>

</thread><thread title=[Sue and Jenna's Sleepover] author=[kornerstrolley] text=[Jenna was wearing a bra now, Sue could see the purple straps through Jenna's green "Dinosoar" shirt with a flying T-rex on it.  *I guess it's just me now,* she thought to herself.  If one more kindly teacher or guidance counselor used the phrase "late bloomer" again, she was going to scream.

Sue felt a stab of jealousy.  Mark was talking to Jenna now, and previously, he had ignored the two of them as though they were moss on a rock instead of people.  Jenna was acting like boys had just gotten 100% more interesting, and her parents even let her get a Facebook!  

Would Jenna still be her friend?  They were about to go into middle school in just two months and start the sixth grade, and Sue wanted to know it wouldn't just be her in those cavernous classrooms all by herself.  

"What's wrong?" Jenna said, looking at Sue thoughtfully.  "You're not normally this quiet..."

"Nothing," Sue said.  "Do you know what we haven't done in a while?"  she asked, hoping to create some more fun memories so Jenna would still stay over.

"What?"

"Prank calls!  Just like when we were little!"  Sue said with a smile.  The smile was contagious, and soon they were beaming at each other just like the old times, eyes bright with the possibility of mischief.

Sue picked up the phone book and hugged it to her chest.  She could have looked numbers up online, but something about the ritual of the heavy yellow tome seemed comforting to her, made her feel like not everything would change.

"Okay!  Me first!"  Jenna said with excitement.  She flipped the book open to a random page, and closed her eyes, finger scanning the page.  Her eyes flashed open, and she looked down.  

"Hey, Sue, isn't this your next door neighbor?"  Sue looked down, and sure enough, the address listed was the one next door.  She couldn't even bring up a picture of him in her mind's eye; he kept to himself, and seemed to shuffle quickly, almost sideways, to his car in the morning like a frightened crab.  The man's name was strange on her tongue.

"Norman?  Who names their kid Norman?"  Sue asked.  Jenna started to laugh.  "Nor-man?  Is he from Norway?  Or is it Nor like in old books and it means not a man?"  They both dissolved in a fit of giggles, saying the word in various accents, drawing out the syllables and spinning them like cotton candy, until the word melted on their tongues, losing all meaning.  

They breathed in deeply, trying to control the giggles, and Jenna, always the braver of the two, actually dialed the number, setting her iPhone speaker on so they could both hear.  

A man picked up.  There was nothing to distinguish his voice.  It wasn't low, it wasn't high, but there was a tremble of excitement in his voice.

"Norman?  Is that you?"  The girls looked at each other.  His name was Norman?  And he was asking if someone named Norman was calling?  Jenna giggled, but Sue felt bad.  Was he mentally ill, like her uncle Joe?  She felt guilty.  Maybe he didn't get a lot of calls to his house.  Maybe this prank call would be crueler to him than to someone else.  She thought about uncle Joe, who had what her mom called "mid-grade autism".  He kept to himself, just like her neighbor Norman, and if he got a call, he would be excited.  If it was a prank call, he would probably be sad and disappointed.

"No sir," Sue cut in.  Right before Jenna was going to rush into their prank routine, she started talking.  

"My name is Sue, I live next door.  I was wondering if you ever needed a cat sitter."  He had a cat, right?  She'd seem him sometimes carrying out the case before he went on a trip.

"Oh," he said, sounding a bit disappointed.  "Thank you.  I'll keep that in mind next time I go away."

Jenna terminated the call out of sheer confusion, and then glared at Sue.  "What was that all about!  I was about to do our routine!"  

"The next one, I promise," Sue said.

</thread><thread title=[Anyone want to help me write the back cover pitch for The Book of Norman?] author=[MattressCrane] text=[So, as I work on the book and clean up the final kinks, I'm moving on to getting the publishing side of things in order. One thing that'll be needed is the tagline- how do I pitch the book in two paragraphs?

I know it's hard for you who haven't read the book, but I'm blanking here. I can't make it sound not... Clinical. All creativity is gone.

Here's what I'm working with:

The Book of Norman is an anthology book featuring hundreds of stories, all revolving around a fictional character named Norman. Norman is a simple man, middle-aged, lives by himself with a cat, and works in an office. Nothing is remarkable about Norman's life, nor is there any great threat to his status quo. The book follows the daily life of Norman, covering the span of a year in his life, with each day being a short story....

Blah blah blah. I think it would be best to leave out the hundreds of stories, at least at first. Dedicate a paragraph to Norman get his character described, then describe what the book has to do with him. Have it read humourously, touch on how this is a dose of reality humor, while being sure to mention that it's not all sunshine and rainbows.

<comment number=[1]author=[Dolferan]text=[You have to keep it enigmatic. People need to feel compelled to read the book. A lot of people will have some idea of Norman before they even see the book. Those who come later will learn of Norman through others. So, here's my suggestion:

Norman could never read a book about Norman. Could he imagine a less-deserving subject? A middle-aged man, living alone in a flat with a cat named Norman? A life so tedious and predictable that even existence itself gets bored? There is a whole universe of possibility out there, so why are you reading this? You could be watching Crime Dramas, jogging or even playing Solitaire.

A sharp pang of guilt flooded through him when he realised that he could be the reason someone else was later for work than he, himself, was. With the dexterity of a magician who specialised in card tricks, Norman moved his finger to the button that opened the lift doors.

Norman got to his desk exactly 4 minutes later than usual. Although it made him a little anxious, he took solace in knowing he had not let his impetuousness ruin another person’s morning.

On to the bathroom he headed, where he began his usual routine. Wiping the crust out of his eyes and washing his face off with a damp rag. Gently brushing his teeth for two minutes exactly. Applying his favorite deodorant. Norman then moved on to the bedroom where he grabbed the outfit he had laid out the night before. He used his steam iron to eliminate any wrinkles he could find. After he promptly dressed himself his next and final stop was the kitchen. There, he made himself a bowl of plain oatmeal with nothing added to it, just as he liked. Once he was finished with his oatmeal, Norman put the dishes away and went back into the bathroom where he looked at himself in the mirror and evaluated his routine, to make sure he hadn't forgotten anything. "Whelp," said Norman, "back to bed."

"Did you find everything okay?" The cashier asked.

"Yes, I did. Thank you." Norman replied.

But Norman did not find everything okay. He had had some trouble looking for Norman's favorite cat food, but he didn't want to be rude to the cashier. She totaled up the food, to which Norman happily paid.

 "Have a nice day." Norman said.

But the cashier did not reciprocate. Norman took this as a gesture that she was very busy, and simply forgot to say "You too."

When Norman returned home, he took out his groceries but noticed something was missing. The bread he purchased wasn't in the bag, but Norman was positive he had picked it off of the shelf. 

"The lady behind me probably took it by mistake." Norman chuckled as he shook his head at how crazy his grocery store trip had been.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5o0d31/norman_pays_for_his_groceries/] createDate=[1484462962] score=[128] numComments=[3]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman joins a protest] author=[Dolferan] text=[When Norman bought socks he bought black socks. He bought black socks because all of his other socks were black. He did not enjoy pairing things up - life was much easier when all of his socks were aesthetically apathetic.

But it wasn't just the colour. They had to be of the same brand: "Filmores Black Socks". And they had to be cotton-rich. He imagined the Kings of England wearing them in bed, swivelling their heels and soles together in shear delight.

Norman estimated that his socks' useful life stretched across about two years. Their relatively short life-span was the price to be paid for luxury. He had calculated that his socks of 2014 would soon be reaching their expiry date and so he had made an appointment with the menswear department.

A lot had happened in two years. Now, the elasticated landscape spanned shelves ranging from hiking socks to a grotesque hybrid of sock and slipper. Norman carefully negotiated his way to the 'no-nonsense' section. He examined the rank and file of black socks and finger-walked his way to 'Filmores'.

Except they weren't 'Filmores'. They were a sock species called 'Flagmores. Norman closed his eyes and squeezed a bunch. No, they were not the same. They were not Filmores. There were no Filmores.

Without thinking, he took one of the impostors in hand and made his way to the checkout. He rationalised: he wasn't complaining, he was merely asking. He was going to place the Flagmores on the counter and say "Sorry to be a nuisance but I was hoping you could tell me where I can find a pair of Filmores." Perfectly reasonable. Perhaps putting them on the counter might seem a little combative, like throwing down the sock gauntlet. No, he was only asking: the Flagmores were for reference; they weren't a weapon.

He arrived at a queue and clipped himself in at the back. He wondered whether he could buy Filmores from the internet but that didn't feel right. 

The counter was only two arm's length away now. Only one customer stood between him and his question, an older woman wearing a silk kerchief around her neck. He craned over her shoulder and saw that she was buying a pair of Flagmores. The cashier looked pained. Silkerchief picked up the Flagmores and waggled them in the air like an eagle its prey.

"I've been coming to this store for over twenty years and you try and pass these off as the real thing?"

The cashier grimaced, "I'm sorry madam.”

Silkerchief leaned in “I don’t think you understand. I came into town especially to buy Filmores. These,”  - she let the socks dribble off her hands onto the counter - “are  of an inferior quality. I daren’t use the term knock-off in an establishment such as this but these” - and this she whispered - “are second-rate."

The cashier stood unblinking as his hands found the phone, "I will speak to the manager."

Silkerchief crossed her arms: "O.K." She turned around and, seeing Norman's Flagmores, raised her eyes to the heavens.

The cashier delivered a strangled mutter into the handset as Norman tucked the socks under his armpit. "The manager will be with us shortly he flat-smiled." The cashier motioned to Norman. 

The complainant took a staccato step to the side and Norman fell into place. He looked to the cashier then back at Silkerchief. He felt the Flagmores swell in his armpit. 

“Can I help you sir?” asked the cashier.

“Uh,” Norman enunciated carefully.

“Do you need a bag for them?” the cashier pointed at the swelling.

“Uh.” Norman whisper-shouted. "I’ve forgotten something.” Norman swivelled on his heel and retreated back into the store. He found himself a column to watch from but was soon shooed away from his post by an idle security guard.

He wished people were more like his socks.

</thread><thread title=[Norman Loses His Remote] author=[stjimmyy] text=[“Norman, where’s the TV remote?” said Norman as he lifted the cushion from his seat and examined the now empty space searching for his lost remote. He was nervous because one of his favorite episodes of CSI was airing tonight. “I could have sworn it was just on the table a minute” Norman said while scratching his head. Norman knew he could turn on the TV without the remote but he worried that it might become too loud and he would have to get up from his chair to change it. He searched everywhere he could think to look in his living room but it was nowhere to be found. Norman was starting to get anxious now, CSI would be on soon but the remote was nowhere to be found. He sat down for a moment, gathering his thoughts to think about where he might have left it. After a good 3 to 4 minutes of thinking he decided this was all too much for him and skipping tonight’s episode of CSI might be for the best. He slowly trudged up the stairs, upset about missing CSI but confident he had made the right decision. Norman turned off his lights and moved his bed sheets over to lay down. Just as his head was about to hit the pillow Norman noticed something on his nightstand, the remote! He remembered now, it had run out of batteries and Norman kept all of his batteries upstairs in the bedroom. Norman quickly got out of bed, grabbed the remote and walked down the stairs with a smile on his face. He sat down in his chair and let Norman rest on his lap, he turned on the TV just in time for the opening credits of CSI and held down on the volume button just because he could now do so. “That was a close one!” Said Norman. He would enjoy his favorite show even more after all of tonight’s stress.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4gmty5/norman_loses_his_remote/] createDate=[1461758973] score=[124] numComments=[5]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman is put on hold] author=[Cygnus--X1] text=[Norman picked up the phone and dialed the number that was on the computer screen in front of him. An automated message told him welcome and told him to make a choice in a menu. Norman dutifully listened to the options and picked the right ones.

"Please hold while we transfer you to a representative", the voice on the tape said.

Norman waited. There was no hold music. Too bad. After 30 seconds or so, the same automated voice message came back to him. "Your call is important to us. Please hold. You are caller number..." There was a slight pause. "... 4."

Norman frowned and looked at the clock on the wall. Caller number 4, it was right in the middle, wasn't it? Just a little too many people in front of him, but not enough to hang up right and try again later. So he waited.

""Your call is important to us. Please hold. You are caller number..." The pause again. "... 4."

Four callers. How much time would that take? Norman tried to do the math in his head, but decided there were too many variables. Maybe one of the four callers had a rather difficult problem. And he had no idea how many people there were to take calls.

"Your call is important to us. Please hold. You are caller number..." "...4."

Norman figeted with his hands. What to do in the meantime? He read over the letter again that he'd received. Maybe he had overlooked the answer he was looking for and this call wasn't necessary at all.

"Your call is important to us. Please hold. You are caller number..." "... 3."

Three! Aha! One step up in the queue! Now how long had that taken? He looked at the clock again but hadn't really registered what time it was when he looked for the first time.

"Your call is important to us. Please hold. You are caller number..." "... 3."

He looked around his desk for things to do. For a while he'd meant to learn how to tie some useful knots. The idea had come to him after watching a show on survival on the Discovery Channel, but he hadn't gotten around to finding a piece of string to practice with. This would've been the perfect time to start practicing, he thought.

"Your call is important to us. Please hold. You are caller number..." "... 3."

Oh man, how long did caller number 3 take? Should he hang up? He was seriously tempted, but if he hung up the phone now it would even be more of a waste of time since he'd spent these last two (or three? Four?) minutes for nothing.

"Your call is important to us. Please hold. You are caller number..." "... 3."

Norman got a little annoyed. He was a customer, right? At least sort of... He shouldn't have to wait this long, should he? 'I'm going to complain to them', he decided. After they've told him what he needed, he would ask to please be transfered to the complaints department and he would tell somebody there that this sort of behaviour towards....

"Your call is important to us. Please hold. You are caller number..." "... 2."

Oh, two! Maybe it's not too bad, Norman thought. Besides, whoever was out there answering the phones was probably very busy anyway. Maybe a complaint wasn't even necessary.

"Your call is important to us. Please hold. You are caller number..." "... 1."

See? He was up next! He waited again, a little more patiently. He straightened some things on his desk., put his little pencilholder exactly on the edge of it, straightened out of loose paperwork.

"Your call is important to us. Please hold. You are caller number..." "... 1."

It was definitely too late to hang up now, Norman thought, when suddenly a different and distinctly human voice made surprised him a little.

"BT Water Service, thank you for your patience, how may I help you?" A friendly voice, probably a young woman's, piped up.

"Hello, I received my last bill and there was a 4 pound surcharge on it but I don't know what that is", Norman explained.

"Oh yes, that's your annual service charge, they always get added to June's bill", the girl explained in her chipper voice.

"Oh of course! Stupid of me to forget", Norman said. "Thank you!"

"You're welcome sir. Is there anything else I can help you with today?"

"No thanks, that'll be all", Norman answered.

"Then I wish you a very pleasant day!"

She cut off the call before Norman could wish her the same. There were probably too many callers after him for her to be wait.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4ojs3v/norman_is_put_on_hold/] createDate=[1466206469] score=[125] numComments=[10]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman goes to the bank.] author=[imrepairmanman] text=[Norman needed some cash, so that he could put a down payment on a new car. He was buying a VW Beetle, as it was small, and he only needed a small car. It helped that the car was for a cheap price, meaning Norman saved a lot of money.

Norman went up to the teller in the bank, and double checked his watch. 10:42 it read. Norman made sure that he would go to the bank on payday, so that he could withdraw without going into overdraw. Norman was almost certain that the paychecks were received by the bank at 10:30, but he came a bit later to ensure that it would be ready.

Norman approached the teller, gave all the appropriate information, and asked what his current balance was. With his careful book keeping, Norman already knew exactly how much money he had, he just wanted to make sure he had received his paycheck. Unfortunately, what the teller told him was his balance before the paycheck, so it must not have been processed yet.

Norman explained everything to the teller, and asked her politely to inform him when the transaction was done processing. As he waited, he sat down in one of the plush chairs for people who are waiting.

He sat next to an old lady who smelled like lavender, and who offered him a singly wrapped mint, which Norman graciously accepted and surreptitiously placed in his pocket. While he sat and waited he traced intricate patterns in the tiles with his eyes and recounted some poetry he had read.

After a while, the teller called to him, and Norman finished his transaction, and wished the teller a good day.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4h6py8/norman_goes_to_the_bank/] createDate=[1462087300] score=[122] numComments=[16]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Leaves a Tip] author=[theycallmechell] text=[“Will that be all for you, sir?” the waitress asked as Norman pushed his plate to the side of the table. 

“Yes, thank you” Norman replied with a great sense of satisfaction. 

It had been awhile since Norman had gone out for dinner on a weekday. Although payday was a couple days away, Norman decided to treat himself. After all, it was his first time winning the quarterly raffle at work. It seemed like fate that he walked away with a $25 gift card to his favorite restaurant.

As the waitress leaned in to grab Norman’s plate, she placed the check face down on the table. “Whenever you’re ready” she said, smiling as she walked away. On any other occasion this moment would have given Norman anxiety as he hated to depart with his hard earned money, but with the gift card in his pocket he reached for the check with a confident grin.

Norman calculated the meal perfectly: Diet Soda - $3, 8oz Steak (Well Done) a la carte - $11, Chocolate Cake $6. After tax, that left enough remaining on the gift card to give the waitress a 15% tip. The service wasn’t great, but Norman felt that leaving anything less than a 15% tip would be rude. 

However, when Norman grabbed the check and glanced down at the total his sense of confidence deflated like a balloon- $24.63. But how, he wondered. Anxious and confused, he brushed the beads of sweat forming on his brow and reviewed the breakdown of his bill. He noticed the problem instantaneously. The waitress charged his steak as a meal and not a la carte. 

“Is something wrong, sir?” 

In his state of disbelief Norman hadn’t noticed the waitress approach the table to retrieve the check. Norman shifted in his chair as he looked up at the waitress, and folded the receipt as if hiding the mistake on the bill would help avoid the waitress from prodding any further. 

“No…no. Everything is fine” he replied as he reached for the gift card in his pocket and handed it to the waitress. 

“Ok, I’ll be right back.” The waitress left and Norman breathed a sigh of relief at the small victory. Yet, the problem remained. What would he leave as a tip? He pulled out his black leather wallet and searched for cash but found none. Then, he considered giving the waitress his debit card when she returned and ask that she run the tip on that. However, he quickly dismissed the idea in fear of inconveniencing the waitress. Plus, the extra minutes spent running the card would make him arrive home late and miss the beginning of his favorite show. 

 “Here you are, sir. Have a great rest of your night.” The waitress returned quicker than Norman anticipated. Norman returned her pleasantries with a nod; avoiding eye contact with the waitress, hoping she wouldn’t see his panic stricken face. 

Facing defeat, Norman grabbed the pen to sign off on the bill. The tip of the pen met the receipt as he attempted to sign his name, but the pen was dry. Then the idea hit him.

Norman exited the restaurant. His shirt pocket felt lighter than it had when he walked in, but the bill was paid – tip included. He only hoped the waitress would enjoy his favorite pen as much as he had. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4pzk2q/norman_leaves_a_tip/] createDate=[1467001805] score=[122] numComments=[8]>

As he walked closer, he observed that it was a brown cardboard box filled with a small collection of books with no distinct theme, ranging from cookbooks to coloring books. There was a piece of paper taped to its side with the word, "FREE", written with a big black marker.

Norman was a little curious to know what other books may have been hiding under the top, surface layer of books, but he did not want to stop in front of someone's house out of fear that someone may come out and begin talking to him about the books that he may or may not take. He also did not feel totally comfortable touching things that had been sitting out on the sidewalk for awhile. Who knows what kind of germs could be within the pages? 

Before he was able to seriously ponder whether to sift through the books or not, he had already walked past the box and was almost at the end of the block.

</thread><thread title=[Norman Eats A Waffle] author=[Wheels1024] text=[Norman was very hungry one morning. He had only minutes to spare before leaving for work. This is when he broke out the toaster and those waffles he bought last night. 
  
Norman set the toaster on a countertop and plugged it in. Norman always unplugged the toaster and kept it stored away to avoid fires. Once the toaster was plugged in, he set the toast level to 4. 4 was the perfect level of "Toastyness". 
  
Once the toaster was set up, Norman went over to his freezer and grabbed the box of store brand waffles. He grabbed two out of the plastic bag they were in, and put the box back in the freezer. Norman walked back over to the toaster and put the waffles in. 
  
While waiting for the waffles to toast, Norman got a plate ready, syrup from the fridge, butter, a butter knife, and fork. The waffles popped out of the toaster, and Norman waited a moment to grab them so he wouldn't burn his hands. Once he let them cool down some, he placed them on his plate and started to head towards the table. 
  
Now at the table, Norman decided to butter his waffles first. Once they were buttered, he put the butter away and started to cut the waffles into small pieces. After a minute of quick cuts, the waffle was perfect. Norman added the syrup than put it back on the fridge.

</thread><thread title=[Norman Sends a Typo] author=[MattressCrane] text=[Norman, eager to get to his lunchbreak, made an error as he sent off an email to Eleanor in HR. Instead of ending his email with "Regards, Norman", instead he ended it with "Regards. Norman"

Norman didn't like coming off as brash. It was something he strives to fight everyday with his always tasteful and polite emails. They were professional, whilst being warm, like the first sip of coffee in the morning. No one has ever complimented Norman's bravado in his emails, but he had also hoped that his subtlety had a rippling effect through his coworkers days.

However, Eleanor's ripple was more like a tear. Norman would have to wait until after lunch to see her response. Norman sighed and left for the breakroom, to fix himself a cup of coffee.

Once Norman reached the pot and poured the mug, he saw that Eleanor was standing behind him, waiting for her chance at the Keurig coffeemaker. 

This was his chance to make it all okay.

"Eleanor," Norman started, "Would you like my cup of coffee?"

Eleanor blushed right through her pounded cherry makeup.

"Why, that's very kind of you Norman!"

Norman smiled and willingly sacrificed his cup of coffee. Eleanor helped herself to a few cubes of sugar and returned to her cubicle, while Norman stayed and fixed himself a second cup.

*If the email brings her spirits down,* Norman thought, *at least the coffee will help bring it back up.*

</thread><thread title=[Norman's Toilet Friend] author=[MattressCrane] text=[Norman and Pete, someone who works on the second floor, only have one thing in common- they head to the toilet at roughly the same time every weekday. Before lunch, Norman would head to the bathroom, and as he left, he almost certainly held the door open for Pete to make his entrance. Pete would nod. Norman would nod. The duality between the two men and a toilet was perfectly balanced. 

One day, Norman encountered Pete somewhere else aside from the men's washroom- the elevator.

Norman nodded. Pete nodded. What made this different was the lack of brevity in their encounter. It made Norman uncomfortable.

Norman nodded again.

Pete was now uncomfortable.

Norman asked whether or not *Crane* was written on all of the female toilets too. 

Pete got out of the elevator.

<comment number=[2]author=[rhowaldt]text=[It was some time ago, and Norman had just started at his new job. It was in an office building, and there were different companies on each floor. The thought filled Norman with excitement and fear at the same time. It was exciting because you could meet somebody new and nice, and it was also scary because you could meet somebody new and nice and not know what to say to them and then they'd never want to speak to you again but they wouldn't say that because it was impolite so instead you'd see each other in the hallway sometimes and have an awkward moment where none of you wants to be there. Or you could meet someone new and dumb, but then you just wouldn't really talk to them anymore, and maybe even quickly turn around once you saw them approaching (as long as they hadn't seen you yet).

During the first week, he hadn't had a single encounter with somebody from another floor. He had been cautious about it, always first looking through the window before entering the shared hallway, keeping an ear open for for approaching footsteps, and so on. He began to feel comfortable and confident in himself that he was doing a good job. His actual job was also going well, he seemed to be very adept at what his boss asked of him, which made him even more confident. So confident, that he got sloppy.

And so, one day, right before lunch, Norman found himself in dire need of the bathroom. He stood up, did not look through windows, did not listen for footsteps, but simply walked towards the bathroom in a desperate but determined stride. He did his deed, washed his hands, dried them using the special one-handtowel technique he saw on some TED talk, and got ready to leave when he awoke from his flow with a sudden shock as the handle of the bathroom door was being pushed down from the other side.

Before Norman even had the time to figure out his reaction, he found himself staring into the face of an unknown man. This was it, then. The moment Norman had tried to avoid for so long, and at the door of the toilet of all places... and when Norman looked into Pete's eyes, he saw there the same doubts, the same fears, the same desperation, and he could almost feel how their mental processes were moving in sync. This made Norman smile, and when he did the unknown face smiled back, and then nodded. Norman nodded back, and they moved around each other in the elegant yet robust dance that only males in shared toilets learn: one out, one in.

Back at his desk, Norman sat down, looked out of the bit of window he could see, and smiled again. He was going to enjoy working here.]score=[7] </comment>

"Oh yes Suzie! Thank you so much," Norman replied with much eagerness. 

Norman loved to eat lunch at his favorite restaurant, The Mundane Cafe, every Sunday. He goes there so often that Suzie remembers his order: The beets with goat cheese salad with extra dressing on the side and no cashews. It made Norman feel special that Suzie cared enough to remember. But on this particular afternoon Norman craved his salad more than usual. He imagined the savory sweetness of the balsamic vinaigrette with the silky smooth goat cheese forming bursts of combination flavors that tickled his tastebuds ever so gently. 

Norman was daydreaming about his salad so much that he didn't notice Suzie come around the corner with it in hand.

"Here you are Norman, enjoy!" 

Norman picked up his fork and dug into his meal. The crunch of the lettuce made his mouth water. As he brought the first bite to his lips he heard Suzie scream. 

"NORMAN WAIT! There's cashews in there! You're allergic, right? I'm so sorry. I'll bring you out a fresh one. I don't know where my head is today."

She grabbed the salad and walked away in a hurry. Norman wanted to think about how he almost just kicked the bucket but instead found himself thinking about how much Suzie cares about him.

Norman hated that sound. His hand came down heavily to smash the alarm, but he paused a second before impact and then lightly tapped the 'snooze' button. He didn't want to break the alarm or hurt his hand. He nodded at his own foresight, then rolled over again. "Just five more minutes," he muttered to himself.

----

Norman sat bolt upright in bed. The sun was shining through the cracks in his blinds, which he knew he should replace, but... eh. He gasped in horror when he realized that he must have slept in for an hour! He would be late for work!

More importantly... Norman! His poor kitty needed food! How could he be such an irresponsible owner?

He stood and ran for the kitchen, only to wince and hang back when bright white clouded his vision. When it cleared, he dashed to the fridge and opened up a new can of food for his hungry cat. He opened the can quickly, spraying tuna juice all over his chin and hands. *It doesn't matter,* he thought, *if I can feed Norman quickly.*

"Here, kitty!" he said loudly. "No-o-orman! Breakfast! Come!"

Norman failed to come.

It was a few minutes later when Norman realized – his cat must have run away! *Yes, that must be it.* Tormented by ravenous hunger, Norman had fled to the wilderness, seeking out prey to feed himself. But he was a hopeless hunter... he would never be able to fare for himself.

Sure enough, Norman came trotting through the cat-flap soon. Norman breathed a huge sigh of relief. "Thank goodness you're safe!" he said. "Here. You can have some food."

As he tipped the tuna into Norman's food bowl, he noticed something. There was already some food in the bowl. That's when he remembered – he had woken up earlier, *then he had fed Norman*, and only then had he gone back to sleep.

Why had he gone back to sleep?

Because... because... *of course!* Because it was the weekend!

Norman wasn't disgruntled about this. He was happy. It meant that he could go back to sleep again.

He lay in bed for a few minutes, then decided he couldn't get back to sleep. He got up instead and went for a walk.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4llvlt/norman_feeds_norman/] createDate=[1464579532] score=[115] numComments=[3]>

After a moment's thought, he opened up Breaking Bad, a show he had recently gotten into. Halfway through reading the next episode's description (something Norman always did even though he was about to watch the actual episode), Norman started thinking. How exciting would it have been to watch Breaking Bad live from the beginning? There was something romantic about keeping up with a new trend in real-time, rather than just streaming whenever he felt like it.




   Maybe I could try that, thought Norman. He opened up his TV guide and looked at some of spring's new shows. He read that a new comedy was going to air in just a few minutes.

</thread><thread title=[Norman Forgets his Lunch] author=[baween] text=[Norman always brought a lunch to work. It was something he prided himself on, like his collection of cut-out comic strips from *the Globe* that he had collected and affixed to his cubicle or the fact that his office plant Wanda had so far survived for four years. It was right about at the point in his day when he would get up to grab a cup of coffee from the Mr. Coffee machine and put his Tupperware container in the lunchroom fridge that he realized his mistake. 

Creeping frustration set in as Norman grasped the implications of his folly. Just as he was accepting his fate and considering his external lunchtime options he remembered that the senior vice-president of sales was hosting a big company-wide event this morning. It would definitely be one of those catered events with the little finger sandwiches and the teensy pastries. Norman wondered which catering company it would be: the folks with the really good egg salad finger sandwiches or the people who always had too many pineapples in their fruit trays. Either way, thought Norman, he wouldn't have to go out and that was a Good Thing.

And, Norman figured as his frustration subsided, his would-have-been lunch was still in the fridge at home and would make a perfectly decent dinner for tonight. Though he was definitely hoping for those little egg salad sandwiches he was mostly just happy that his foolish mistake had been made moot in such a convenient way.

</thread><thread title=[Norman finds excitement at the grocery store] author=[Alaka_Zam] text=[Norman hurried down the street. At the stoplight, he checked his watch. 'Not bad, still have about 30 minutes until my show begins', he thought to himself. The light changed and Norman crossed the street, and into the grocery store.

This entrance always confused Norman. It was at the wrong end of the cashier aisles and he had to walk all the way to the end to enter. There always seemed to be a mess of children and shopping carts to deal with.

He set his shoulders and started into the crowd. Just ahead of him, a man ducked down an empty aisle. As he neared the chain gate, the man bent down, to unclip it. 

Norman felt a small thrill of excitement. 'Could he also do this?' he wondered. It would certainly be nice not to have to walk all the way to the end. Perhaps he could sneak in behind this gentleman.

Just as Norman turned down the aisle, he saw he was too late. The gentleman was already clipping the chain back in place.

Unsure of his next move, Norman froze for a moment. He decided he'd had enough excitement and turned back. 

'That was enough for this run- maybe next time!' he thought, a small smile turning up the corner of his mouth. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4nnqck/norman_finds_excitement_at_the_grocery_store/] createDate=[1465715259] score=[115] numComments=[2]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Comes Prepared] author=[[deleted]] text=[Every Monday, Norman’s coworker, Jasper, who worked in the cubicle across from Norman’s, would walk in twelve or thirteen minutes after 9:00, after Norman had already settled in. By this time, Norman would be finished logging onto his work computer, tucking his briefcase underneath his desk, and packing his navy blue lunchbox safely away in the top right corner of the communal refrigerator (Norman liked to be one of the first people to choose a spot for his lunch – the bottom two shelves always got leaked on and more than once, Norman had excitedly pulled out his lunchbox to eat his turkey bologna sandwich only to have a pool of ice water cascade over his work slacks).

And every Monday between 9:12 and 9:13, Jasper would ask Norman how his weekend had been.  “It was nice,” Norman would respond, following up with varying attempts to desperately remember if he had left his house at all, other than to do the shopping - “I got caught up on some reading and spent some time with Norman” (Jasper would assume Norman meant his son rather than his cat). Sometimes, Jasper would ask Norman which book he was reading now, but more often than not, he would simply smile pityingly and tell Norman about his excursion to Long Island or his day out on his wife’s sailboat.
This particular Monday, however, Norman was prepared. Norman’s son had invited him to a move-in celebration at his new apartment in Upper Manhattan and they had spent a lovely weekend together, with Norman Jr. showing his father his favourite places to go for brunch and the best time of day to go for a walk in the nearby park. This Monday, Norman would have an answer to Jasper’s regular question that he could be proud of.

Norman glanced at the clock on his computer monitor. 9:14. Norman’s brow became increasingly furrowed as he glanced again and again at the monitor over the next sixteen minutes, wondering if Jasper had taken the day off. He finally felt his shoulders loosen as Jasper jogged into the office, panting. Norman smiled expectantly, waiting for his coworker to ask him about his weekend.

“Some traffic today, huh?” Jasper directed the question at Norman. “It’s like three drops of rain trickle down and everybody forgets how to drive.”

“Oh, yeah, right? Nuts,” Norman laughed.

Norman always made sure to get to the office at promptly 8:57, so he had missed the rain and, apparently, the traffic, too. Norman waited for Jasper to follow up with their usual exchange, but Jasper sat down at his desk and got to work, making up for his lost time. Norman opened his mouth, thinking about bringing up the weekend first, but he thought better and closed it again. Jasper was probably eager to get caught up. Disappointed that he couldn’t share his story with Jasper, Norman opened up the Excel spreadsheet he had been working on. *I’ll take myself somewhere special this weekend*, Norman thought.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4rq2gr/norman_comes_prepared/] createDate=[1467944333] score=[109] numComments=[8]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman prepares some leftovers.] author=[Zadder] text=[One evening after work, Norman found himself a bit hungry. He'd already taken a shower and changed into his lounging clothes, so going out to eat was naturally out of the question. *I wonder what's in my fridge?* Thought Norman.

Norman stood up slowly, lifting himself up out of the decidedly bottom-shaped impression his good recliner had developed. He gave an amused snort at this observation as he crossed his kitchen to the refrigerator.

The fridge, to Norman's pleasure, was mostly empty and tidy, save a single bowl of beef stroganoff his mother had cooked for him the week before. Not fresh, thought Norman, but certainly not worth throwing out. He put the bowl in the microwave and closed the door quietly, and delicately entered *1:00* on the timer, just like always.

*Just like always.* Norman pondered at this, and promptly pressed *Reset.*

*What if I shook things up tonight?* He thought carefully. *Who would stop me from really going off the wall?* Norman's heart raced at the possibilities laid before him. Was he to live his entire life in a rut? To blindly obey the simple status quo that seemed to define his very existence? It was time, he knew, to do something *way* out of the ordinary.

With shaking hands, Norman re-entered the timer:

</thread><thread title=[Norman Gets Cancer Part II] author=[mcmonsoon] text=[Norman woke up from an hour long nap and his cat was now coiled up in a ball at the foot of the bed. He remembered what the Web MD had said about him having arm cancer and all, and it still frightened him quite a bit. This pain in his arm was like a sharp pricking feeling every time he moved. 

Norman knew that the worst thing he could do is sulk in bed until his time finally came, so he gathered the courage to get up and take a shower. It was a big first step.

He began removing his pajama pants and long sleeve shirt and just as he pulled it over his head of ruffled hair, he felt the *sharpest pain* in his arm yet.

*"OW! WHAT THE-*" Norman yelped. When he peeled off the shirt completely, he threw it on the floor and grabbed his arm, but it began to feel different immediately.

The pain was... gone.

Bewildered, he glanced back and forth from his arm to the pile of clothes and that's when he saw it. A tiny piece of duct tape was stuck to the inside of the sleeve of the shirt. It must have gotten there yesterday morning when he used the tape to repair some cardboard boxes.

He immediately put it all together in his head— the tape was tugging at his arm hairs. It wasn't cancer. 

"*It... it isn't cancer, Norman. I think I'm going to be okay."* he muttered to himself as a faint smile appeared on his face.

Norman weaved between Normans legs and purred.

</thread><thread title=[Norman is pained by the past.] author=[polarbearonvacation] text=[Each summer a few of the families on Norman’s block got together for a community garage sale. While Norman’s ascetic lifestyle typically prevented him from having much to contribute to the aforementioned garage sale, he always tried to find an item or two to sell. A pair of shoes that rubbed his heel wrong. A button-down that had been liberated of a few of its buttons. Things that were still useful, but not to him.

This year Norman elected to check the attic. He seemed to remember stashing a few of Melinda’s things up there, and he was certain he would find some of Norman Jr’s old toys as well.

It had been years since Norman ventured into the attic. He noticed immediately that some of the insulation had fallen down. *A chore for another day*, Norman thought. He rummaged through old boxes of bowling trophies and wondered why he had stopped playing. He seemed to remember Melinda disliking that he came home smelling like cigarettes. *But smoking is banned in most places now. I don’t need to worry about smoke any longer*, he mused, and then he remembered that he no longer needed to worry about Melinda either.

Amongst the detritus Norman found Norman Jr’s Big Wheel, sun-faded and missing a rear wheel, an old baseball mitt, and eight large Rubbermaid containers filled with Legos. Norman stuffed the baseball mitt into his back pocket and began hauling the Legos out of the attic.

After wiping the copious amount of dust off the Rubbermaids, Norman opened each one. Each box was organized by color, and in one of the boxes he found a three-ring binder containing the directions for all of the sets he and Melinda bought for Norman Jr. Pirate ships and castles. Spaceships and cattle ranches. Norman sat down amongst the boxes and flipped through all directions. There was a time in Norman’s youth when he would have ignored the manuals and simply let his imagination build whatever it pleased, but now the thought of not following the instructions made Norman’s palms sweat. He settled on a model of a plane. He thought it looked like a crop duster, and he always enjoyed watching crop dusters come in close to the ground, close enough to touch it seemed, and then soar back up into the air again, unreachable.

At first the build went smoothly. The plane used a lot of standard size pieces, and finding them within the boxes was easy. However, when he got to the more intricate parts of the plane, the pieces became increasingly difficult to find. *Why didn’t organize these by type*, he thought, *That would’ve made this much simpler.* But Norman was committed. After an hour or so, he had completed his airplane. He set it upon the coffee table and then laid down on the couch. 

Much to his surprise, Norman napped. While he slept, Norman had joined him on the couch, curling up on his abdomen and partaking in a nap of his own. Norman awoke to Norman’s soft purring and the kneading of his paws. “We must’ve been tired, Norman. Perhaps the heat of the attic took it out of us.” Not wanting to upset Norman, he picked him up before he swung his own legs off the couch. Norman had made sun tea yesterday, and a cold glass of tea seemed a perfect post-nap refreshment. He took two steps towards his kitchen when a pain he had not felt in years coursed through his body. Without thinking, he dropped Norman and simultaneously raised his right knee, catching Norman with his thigh. Norman yowled just as Norman yowled. Norman fell back on the couch, cradling his right foot. He ran his hand along the base of his foot and dislodged the small white Lego that had planted itself in his heel. For several minutes Norman rubbed his foot. 

Once the pain abated, he attempted to find Norman, but he had run off and hid. Norman hoped he would forgive him. Forgoing the tea, Norman dismantled his airplane and returned the pieces to their respective boxes and gave his carpet a final sweeping for any other renegade Legos. Satisfied there were no remaining pieces, he loaded up the Rubbermaids and carried them down to his neighbors.

He hoped some other father did not suffer the same fate as he.

</thread><thread title=[Norman's CD] author=[Question7NWantAnswer] text=[Norman tied his shoes, and quickly strolled out of work. Norman was in store for a particularly eventful day today. He had preordered the new CSI commentary CD and was going to pick it up, and listen to it at home with his headphones on.

Norman got to the store and saw the CD. 1 hour and 17 minutes of glorious commentary. He quickly paced over to the shelf, grabbed the CD and headed to the checkout.

"*Lovely weather we're having*" Norman said to the checkout man as he presented his pre-order card.

"*Yeah, it's alright. Your total will be 3.99*" said the checkout man

Norman checked his wallet. He got worried for a minute. "*I counted the money 3 times this morning*" Norman thought. Just before Norman began to panic, he saw the final dollar bill. He quickly handed over the 4 dollars to the checkout man. 

"*Here's your CD*" the checkout man said

"*Thank you kindly"* Norman said, as he excitedly walked out of the store.

Norman got in his car. He was tempted to listen to the CD right there in the car, but he wanted to use his favorite headphones to listen to the commentary. 

Norman drove home, parked his car perfectly, and quickly walked to his house. When he walked in, he sat in his favorite chair, got out his favorite CD player, put in the new CSI CD, and plugged in his headphones. Or so he thought...

"My favorite part about filming this famous crime scene..." Norman heard from the CD player. But the sound quality was different. He realized his mistake. The headphones were not plugged in all the way.

"*How embarrassing!*" Norman thought. "*What if Norman heard that*"

Just as Norman thought this, Norman walked into the room. "*Meow*" he said

Norman was embarrassed. He decided that next time he would be more careful when plugging his headphones in.

He had never considered that an escalator might stop. Of course Norman was prepared for an elevator to stop. He knew just what he would do. He would wait patiently for it to start again or for a fireman to come and give him further instructions. It was not safe to try to exit a stopped elevator. 

But now all of Norman’s mental preparation was foiled. It seemed that the same general principle ought to apply. A non-moving escalator might be just as dangerous as a non-moving elevator. Perhaps he should stay put. On the other hand, isn’t a stopped escalator just a set of stairs? Perhaps he would look foolish or lazy just standing on a stopped escalator when he could easily walk up it. He nervously nodded to a lady who passed by him on the down escalator. She was looking at her phone and didn’t seem to notice him.

Norman decided he was being foolish after all. He lifted his left foot, but just then with another slight jolt the escalator resumed. Norman almost lost his balance! Stepping off the escalator a few seconds later Norman breathed a sigh of relief, but then scolded himself for acting so rashly. Of course the proper course of action would have been to wait patiently. 

Norman completed his business, and when it was time to return to ground level he decided to look for the elevator bank.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/56bafs/in_which_norman_rides_an_escalator/] createDate=[1475874903] score=[105] numComments=[7]>

The menu was varied, but there wasn't anything Norman didn't recognize. He decided to have a chicken salad sandwich with chips and an iced tea. He rubbed his hands together with glee when the pretty girl behind the counter handed him his plastic basket of food. Norman then became embarrassed; he hoped the girl didn't think he was rubbing his hands at her.

Norman sat down at a small table facing away from the counter and the girl. He placed his tea on a napkin with salt sprinkled on it, then smiled as he brought the whole-wheat slab to his mouth.

Norman chewed, and furrowed his brow. He peeled back the top slice of bread, swallowed his bite, and opened his mouth in surprise.

</thread><thread title=[Norman buys a Necklace for Lisa] author=[justfornorman] text=[It was finally Friday. Norman had a long week at work, and was really looking forward to spending some time with Norman in front of the TV for a CSI marathon, which they began every Friday night at 7pm. Norman loved watching his CSI master collection on DVD, but this week there was a marathon on television coinciding with his normal schedule. Norman decided to watch CSI on television instead. He liked how the commercials gave him a chance to let his mind wander from time to time without missing out on the details of the show. 

Unfortunately, Norman’s cable was acting up again, and the channel of the CSI marathon wasn’t working. Never one to get too down on himself, Norman quickly remembered there were some episodes On Demand. Originally he didn’t like the idea of having such a fancy addition to his cable, but it came with his bundled deal, and it had become a convenience he never knew he desired in life. With On Demand, he could still have commercials play, and let his mind wander or spend a few minutes playing with Norman between scenes. 

One of Norman’s favorite parts of his CSI marathons was getting to fall asleep to the sound of the show in the background. At 1:13am Norman awoke to some excitement on the television. The channel had automatically changed from On Demand after CSI ended. Now the jewelry television channel was playing. Norman knew this channel well. His ex-wife used to watch it incessantly. This particular item was an emerald necklace touted to be over seventy-five percent off retail. Norman knew his wife would jump at the chance for this piece. Should he call and tell her? Should he get it for her as a gift to show he still loved her, after all she put him through? No, he decided he to buy it for a future lady. Who knows, maybe next week he’ll finally get up enough courage to ask out Lisa from work. They have often bonded in conversations over their mutual love for CSI. At the delightful idea of having another woman in his life, Norman picked up the phone and ordered the necklace before returning to sleep with a smile on his face.

</thread><thread title=[Norman Gets a Date] author=[hipipop] text=[Sunday, Norman awoke to another stormy morning. Norman went through his daily routine and decided to postpone his morning walk with Norman to avoid getting soaked.

Norman sat on his couch and grabbed his newspaper. Relieved that the plastic wrapping saved the paper from getting wet, Norman rushed to the crossword section and began immediately. 

Halfway through the puzzle, Norman was clueless to one of the clues. "Month of CSX Transportation Railroad Formation." After a few minutes of pondering what this might be, Norman quickly, but carefully, made his way to his room and back. Once he say back down, Norman opened his "20th Century Rail Networks: Collector's Edition" book, which he always kept by his nightstand for casual reading. Norman found himself in the table of contents and searched quickly before finding it; CSX Transportation. Norman quickly turned to page 162 and searched. After searching for a few minutes, Norman got the date, June 1st, 1986.
Norman quickly wrote down the month June to see it perfectly fit with the words juvenile and oxidize.

Norman decided to take a break, all this rushing through rooms and books had his adrenaline pumping already.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5vfhbi/norman_gets_a_date/] createDate=[1487753151] score=[103] numComments=[7]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Laments on his Election Day Decisions] author=[GoGreenGiant] text=[Norman sat down for breakfast at the table with his lightly buttered toast and prepared himself emotionally for what might be a rough ride. It was election day and he was about to consider the possible electorates to the presidency of the United States. Norman was not pleased with the decisions he was faced with. 

Norman didn't want to associate with racism, bigotry, or xenophobes, that put a black mark on the Trump campaign. Norman wasn't sure of any specific reason, but it was a problem. Something about Mexico...

Norman also didn't want to be associated with general crookedry. Again, he wasn't sure why, but that put a black mark in the Hillary Clinton campaign. Something about emails and cattle futures, Saudi Arabia.

Norman had about all he could handle, and stepped up to take care of Norman's cries for breakfast. As the can of Tuna Pate plopped into the dish, it reminded Norman of the one viable choice he wished America wouldn't have ignored earlier.

The choice he wished he could make wasn't crooked, or afraid of xylophones, it was vaguely adequate at best, and mediocre at worst. Norman certainly couldn't recall any of his policy positions or campaign platforms, but he was sure that he had them, and that they were probably reasonable. Not like the unreasonable decision he was trying to make today.

Norman was upset for a moment as he realized that we, as a country, collectively rejected the notion of vague adequacy. 

His name was Martin O'Malley.

Norman let out a sigh for lost opportunity, and went back to the unseemly task at hand. Norman knew one thing though, it was election day, and he took his civic duty to vote very seriously.

</thread><thread title=[Norman's fashion disaster] author=[PizzaWithKetchup] text=[Thursday morning, 6:10AM. Norman woke up to his alarm clock. He was tempted to click "snooze", but he that would be too risky. He pushed down the toaster button and poured his coffee; two milks one sugar. He set it on the table and He poured Norman's water and food into his tiny metal bowls. Just the usual morning before work. He ate, cleaned up and headed to work.
Thursday morning, 9:13AM. Work is busier than usual. Norman is using both of his phones at his desk; this hasn't happened in 3 months. As he was trying to understand the man's accent on the left phone, he dropped a paper clip on the office carpet. He looked down and his day just got worse....

How? Norman had to blink a few times and was in disbelief. He almost wanted to hang up the phone. One of his socks were navy blue with a diamond pattern, the other sock was burgundy with the exact same pattern. "How and why did this have to happen on such a crazy day?" Norman thought. His palms got even sweatier and paranoia kicked in. "Better get back to work, pretend everything is normal".


Thursday evening, 5:52PM. Norman is almost done work. He pretended to drop his pencil, rolled down the bottom of his pants to be lower than usual. "Pretend everything is normal, no one will notice" he thought. He took a deep breath, got his briefcase, and walked out the office quickly. "Bye Norman, see you tomorrow!" said Joanne. "Bye" Norman quickly said as he speed walked to the elevator.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4nrm8m/normans_fashion_disaster/] createDate=[1465785759] score=[101] numComments=[8]>

Perhaps it would work if I touched the sensor thought Norman. Norman wanted a paper towel but was afraid to touch the sensor. One finger, almost as if against his will approached the sensor ready to touch the red sensor which blinked invitingly as if begging Norman to brush against it and unleash an infinite supply of paper towels to fulfill all of his drying needs. Just when Norman thought he could resist no longer the bathroom door opened and a man walked in. Norman jerked his hand away, ashamed. He left the bathroom wiping his hands on his pants.

</thread><thread title=[Norman has Indigestion.] author=[tonystone2001] text=[Norman was typing at his computer one fine Thursday afternoon. As Norman once again inputed info into his Excel table, he noticed an odd sensation in his stomach. Norman had met his son for lunch a few hours earlier, and his son had suggested Indian food. Although not a fan of spicy food himself, Norman didn't want to disappoint his son. After all, he didn't see him very often.

Norman had ordered the Plain Dosa, but the sauce that came with it was very spicy. Not wanting to waste the sauce, out of fear for a confrontation with the owner over his lack of sauce usage, Norman generously poured it on. Even though it required 3 glasses of water, and small square of milk chocolate to eventually stop the burning, Norman enjoyed seeing his son again.

As Norman sits in his chair reminiscing about his meal, he once again feels the gurgling in his stomach. Looking to resolve this issue, Norman looks into his desk for the pack of Rolaids he keeps for emergencies. 

After searching through his desk for several minutes, Norman recalls that he had thrown out the Rolaids, after seeing that they had expired. Cursing his past self, Norman trudged over to the cubicle of Sam the accountant, and borrowed some Alka Seltzer Tablets from him. While not being Rolaids, Norman felt they would be fine. As Norman deposited the tablets into a glass of tap water from the kitchen. Norman recalled the "Plop, plop, fizz, fizz, oh what a relief it is" jingle from his childhood. 

After he drank the frothy drink at his desk, Norman began to hum along to the jingle as he went back to his Excel speadsheet, feeling quite better.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4ccpee/norman_has_indigestion/] createDate=[1459235140] score=[106] numComments=[4]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman panics] author=[thexvillain] text=[Norman ate his cornflakes while staring at the peeling corner of the wallpaper next to his toaster. "I could probably glue that back down... or maybe peel it off and get that new pattern I saw in Redbook... I'll have to think about that."

He glanced at his watch and realized that his daydreaming had put him a minute behind his normal schedule. He poured the milk from his bowl and gave it a quick rinse, grabbed his jacket, and headed out the door to his car.

Traffic was relatively clear, so Norman arrived at the office at 8:51, fortunately no one had taken his favorite parking spot. 
Despite the rocky start, the rest of the day seemed to go quite well, he even got a chuckle from his cubemate Frank with the email he forwarded to him.

As Norman walked to his car at the end of the day, he reached into his pocket for his keys... Just then a sudden panic crossed his mind. "Oh no!" He thought. He tried desperately to remember the last time he took his keys from his pocket, he stood still at his car door, sweating. Norman was now almost certain that he had forgotten to lock his front door while leaving in such a hurry this morning.

Norman now moved with conviction, he got into his car and made his way home, of course he didn't speed, but he did feel bad that he hadn't yielded to allow that car to merge in front of him on Elm.

Norman arrived at home and quickly made his way to the door, he reached out and turned the knob... but it didn't open, he breathed a sigh of relief, apparently he had locked the door after all. He unlocked the door, made his way inside and finished washing his cereal bowl from that morning.

Norman was shocked. For 25 years he had been using this same computer. It was a gift from his ex-wife. Him and Norman Jr. used to use the computer together when Norman Jr. was little. He even asked his boss if he could use this one instead of the standard MacBook laptop everyone else used at work. It finally looked like the end of the road for the Commodore. "*No!*" Norman internally cried. He decided that he would ask the IT department for help in trying to fix his computer. Norman had never talked to them before. He had never had problems with his reliable Commodore. Norman walked over to Jeff, the head of the IT department, and began talking about his computer issues. 

*"Hello, uh Jeff, my computer's screen just went dark and I need help fixing it"* Norman said.

*"Hey you're the guy with the Commodore computer right?"* said Jeff

*"Yeah"* replied Norman

*"That's a unique computer you got I remember I had one back in the 90's. Very unique."* Jeff said.

*"Thanks"* said Norman

*"Hang on, let me go take a look"* said Jeff

Jeff walked over to Norman's desk. He crouched under Norman's desk and chair and crawled towards the power outlet. Jeff plugged in the computer again.

 *"The computer was not plugged in all the way and had turned off."* Jeff told Norman

*"Oh, okay"* Norman replied in relief. *"Thanks Jeff"* 

*"No problem Norman!"* Jeff said as he walked away.

But, seeing many advertisements lately from a local burger joint, Norman decided to treat himself on a Thursday. He figured that he would heat up some leftovers from Saturday and not eat out on Sunday.

Norman walks into the burger joint after work on Thursday, very excited, seats himself, and looks over the menu. He decides on the hamburger with fries, and tells the waitress so. She brings it to him about 20 minutes later, and Norman finds the hamburger to be somewhat dry but the fries to be exceptional. He goes home on a full stomach and turns in early, exhausted from his mid-week escapade.

Norman wakes up tomorrow a little more tired than usual, and decides that he'll save these adventures for the weekend, where they belong.

</thread><thread title=[Norman Rakes the Leaves] author=[ejambu] text=[It was really starting to feel like fall. The leaves were rapidly changing and had begun falling to the ground. Norman loved the fall colors, but wasn't as delighted about the chores they brought with them. The leaves were quickly filling his once-beautiful flower beds, and it would take a lot of work to clear them. 

One Sunday morning, he began his tedious fall task, raking what seemed like an endless supply of leaves into little piles across the yard. Norman, the curious creature he was, came out to examine the leaves. Seeing them drift in the breeze, he couldn't help but pounce! Norman landed in Norman's largest leaf pile with a great "whoosh!" Norman couldn't help but laugh. He threw handfuls of leaves for the cat to chase. 

Once they were tuckered out, Norman realized he'd made more of a mess than there had been when he started. "Oh well, I guess I'll have to start over tomorrow," he told his little yard-work partner. "But, you know, raking the leaves wasn't quite as bad as I thought after all."

He loved the characters and the situations of CSI, but he wanted something new. One day, he noticed that his TiVO had recommended that he watch Criminal Minds.

Norman Jr. had just texted him, so he decided to ask Junior what he thought of the show. He didn't want to watch it if he wouldn't like it. Junior knew him better than anybody.

*Do you like Criminal Minds?* He typed into his phone slowly- he wasn't a fast texter yet. He normally preferred calling someone, but Junior liked texting better so he was trying to adapt to his son's way of communication.

The reply was almost instantaneous: *Yeah, I like it OK. Breaking Bad is better.*

Norman had heard of Breaking Bad once, but the concept made him uncomfortable. He decided he would try Criminal Minds and leave the recommendation for Breaking Bad some other time.

The episode made Norman very uncomfortable, and he turned it off halfway through. He decided CSI was much better for him. There was a comfort in knowing what was going to happen next. He liked that part of it. Before he went to bed that night, he texted his son back. He spent some time thinking about what to write back to Junior. He didn't want him to think he didn't like the show his son thought was good.

*Yes, it was OK.*] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4u98xj/norman_tries_criminal_minds/] createDate=[1469325181] score=[100] numComments=[11]>

Norman playfully patted Norman on the head, and carried him to the kitchen under his arm. He brought out a tin of cat food and put it into Norman's bowl.

Then Norman set about making his toast, but when he opened his bread bin he found that nothing was there but crumbs!

Frazzled, Norman slipped on his slippers and walked across the road from his house to buy bread at Tesco. Then he walked back over the road to his house, went inside and popped bread inside his toaster.

The bread was soon toasted, and Norman then plated it and buttered it before sitting on his couch. "What a day." He smiled, shaking his head to himself.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5nbc2x/norman_makes_toast/] createDate=[1484156827] score=[98] numComments=[10]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman's Missed Opportunity] author=[Chrdav65] text=[Norman was very disappointed with himself. The previous night Norman had squeezed just enough tooth paste out of the tube to brush his teeth. Typically Norman was prepared with an additional tube on standby but he must have missed it this time while preparing his weekly shopping list.

Luckily, Norman wakes up an hour early to prepare for such disasters and decided he would have time to walk to the local convenience store down the block to purchase a tube.

“Two tubes this time.” Norman thought to himself. He was determined to not let this happen again. 

Out of courtesy, Norman placed one Altoid in his mouth to ensure his breath would not be offensive and made his travel down the block.

It was there in the tooth paste aisle that he saw her. Lisa. Norman had not seen Lisa since she left the office 3 months prior. His hands began to sweat and his knees slightly buckled.

Norman prepared himself and walked towards the Colgate. Lisa turned and their eyes met.

“Hey Norman!” Lisa began excitedly. “Oh, this is so embarrassing, I ran out of tooth paste this morning and had to run to get a tube before work.”

Norman couldn’t believe the odds, was this fate? Just then Norman’s cell phone rang and he saw it was Norman Jr. Norman smiled and motioned toward his phone as Lisa nodded, waved, and silently whispered “Gotta run, gonna be late. Let’s catch up sometime.”

Norman answered “Hello son!” No response. Norman looked down and saw “one missed call: Norman Jr.” as a text followed from his son: “Hey dad, sorry about that! Was trying to call a friend and hit your number by mistake! Talk soon!”

Norman was disappointed that he had missed an opportunity to talk to both his son and Lisa but was pleased when he noticed that the two pack of Colgate was on sale.

</thread><thread title=[Norman goes for lunch.] author=[relaxtherebuddy] text=[It was a Monday morning.  Norman's alarm went off at 6:00am but he wasn't ready to get up yet.  Norman had nuzzled himself into Norman's chest.  His warmth and the tempo of his breathing was so pleasant, Norman wanted to savor it for an extra moment.  After rising at 6:05, he realized he would have to get ready quicker than usual.

In the haste of his morning, Norman forgot to take his lunch from the fridge and place it in his backpack.  He thought about it for a bit and ultimately resigned himself to the fact that he have to eat his lunch for dinner and would purchase lunch from the sandwich shop across the street.  "I guess that's the price you pay for staying in bed" he thought.

When he arrived at the sandwich shop, he examined the long list of choices.  The pizza sub was the cheapest, but the thought of the medley of meats in the cold-cut combo was so intriguing, Norman decided to throw caution to the wind and spend the extra half-dollar on it.

When the cashier rung him up, the number on the til was lower than he expected.  He took a look at his sandwich and realized it had a "pizza sub" sticker on it.  Norman didn't want to hold up the long line of customers by making the cashier change the order, but he also didn't want to be dishonest.  After deliberating for four or five seconds (it probably felt more like ten) Norman told the cashier he actually had a cold cut combo.  The cashier apologized and rung him up for the correct amount.  Norman thought it wasn't necessary for the cashier to apologize since it was not him who made the mistake, but Norman didn't bother telling him since he had already taken up so much of everyone's time.

As he ate his sandwich, he thought about the importance of getting up on time.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5tps33/norman_goes_for_lunch/] createDate=[1486975483] score=[95] numComments=[4]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Sells a Couch on Craig's List] author=[nightingaleeffect] text=[Norman looked at his tired auburn couch with bittersweet nostalgia. The missing boxspring, the worn fabric on his favorite arm, it told a story that was on its final page. 

Norman knew he'd have to find a new couch before his parents came for a visit. 

Norman considered dragging it to the curb, but that didn't seem a fitting sendoff for the couch. 

Norman decided to take a chance and post on Craig's List. He provided a photograph of the couch from two angles, as well as a brief description. He'd originally purchased it for $500, but with the wear, marked it down to $200. 

He posted it and then went on with the other items on his to-do list. Three days later, a man inquired as to the couch. Norman met the man; a Vietnamese psychoanalyst looking for a new waiting room couch. He showed it to the man and a woman that appeared to be his girlfriend. 

The man expressed interest in buying the couch and offered Norman a check. Norman said he'd prefer they cash the check at a bank together to ensure it cleared. They agreed and Norman helped the psychoanalyst load the couch on the roof of his car before the drive to the bank. 

The check cleared and Norman shook hands with the fellow, then returned home to tend to some other errands and tidying up. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/578wdc/norman_sells_a_couch_on_craigs_list/] createDate=[1476368365] score=[93] numComments=[10]>

After accidentally saying "f--k darm" in front of some co-workers earlier in the day, Norman knew that he was out of control. *From now on*, Norman declared in his thoughts, *I shall use a swear jar*. Norman placed the jar labelled with marker and tape on top of his microwave.

Norman thought about what small appliance he could buy after saving up over the span of a year of swears. The jar of pennies he accumulates is used for lottery tickets, and the jar of nickels he accumulates is used for sandwiches on certain holidays. The thought of a third jar made Norman excited for the possibilities.

As the end of the third week came of Norman having the swear jar, he realized he didn't raise a single dollar. Cautiously, after locking his front door and re-hanging up his phone, Norman opened the jar lid and whispered, 

"*Shit*."

Norman placed a dollar in the jar. He wasn't proud of his newfound hobby of cursing, but without it, he would never will himself to buy a new pair of shoes the following year.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/56nqzu/norman_says_a_swear_word_part_2/] createDate=[1476069415] score=[101] numComments=[7]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Remembers Lisa] author=[MattressCrane] text=[As Norman passed by a pretty blonde woman on the sidewalk one morning, he was quickly reminded of Lisa, a coworker he once fancied many months ago. Norman thought back to that time period of his life- barely a day went by without him feeling the urge to describe to his cat a small anecdote about Lisa. [The time Norman and Lisa felt a spark.](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/3yo86x/norman_and_lisa_feel_a_spark/) [The time he wrote all capital letters at her in an email.](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/40e8h5/norman_shouts_at_lisa/) [The time he impressed her with his movie trivia knowledge.](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/43xqet/norman_impresses_lisa/) [The time they listened to the vents turn off.](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4pxpa3/norman_falls_down_a_staircase/)Yes, there were many good and intimate moments with Lisa, and if the cat could speak, he would have said, "Enough already! Just make a move!"

Norman did not make a move. He thought back to Lisa's final shift at his office, before she was transferred to a downtown branch. She wore a beige blouse with a long white skirt, and Norman, desperate to try and speak openly about his feelings for her, had to change his shirt three times that day due to the excessive nervous sweating.

At the lunch hour, Norman and Lisa were in the break room, by themselves, silently waiting for a popcorn bag to be finished with the microwave. Lisa squirmed, stepping her toes on top of each other, and each time Norman and her glanced at each other, no words were spoken- just raised eyebrows and a smack of the lips as if to say, 'Yep, here we are.'  

"So!" Lisa said, in between a lip smack.

"Busy day?" Norman asked. 

"Yes! Very... It's my last day and all..."

"Oh, yeah!" Norman responded. He was sweating again. He wanted to stop, but he figured if he just blurted it out, if he just told Lisa that she made him feel like a little boy with a crush on the prettiest girl in school, or that he felt happier with her than any time spent with his ex-wife, or that, if she requested it, would move to the downtown branch along with her, if it meant that they could stay together. 

Norman said none of those things. The popcorn timer dinged, and three hours later, Lisa's desk was packed into a cardboard box, and left scant a trace behind. The office, albeit always a dim and quiet place, felt noticeably empty the following day, and the following week. Norman was heartbroken.

Many months later, the memories of Lisa had faded. He remembered his feelings for her, and the incredible urge to be bold in the final moments of knowing her. But now, as time goes on, Norman didn't feel as if he really missed anything out of the ordinary in his life. He had many crushes over the years; barista's, secretaries, regulars on the bus route, next door neighbors, and celebrities every now and then. Because this happened so often- the cycle of falling in love and never acting- Norman felt okay with forgetting Lisa. That was just how his life has always been.

In the end, Lisa is just another name on the roster of what could have been. *Perhaps the next one will count.*] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5i6gow/norman_remembers_lisa/] createDate=[1481694633] score=[93] numComments=[12]>

His son had finally convinced him to get rid of his flip phone and get a smartphone. Norman didn't really see what made his new smartphone so special, but he thought that the vibrance of the screen was neat. 

Norman was messing around with his phone and wasn't paying too much attention to what's going on around him. He heard the sound of the restroom door opening and someone said "Hello?" Norman assumed it was a custodian coming to clean the restroom. He thought that he better reply quickly as to avoid any awkward confrontation. So to reply and let the custodian know that he was there, Norman said "Hi" from behind the stall door. About a half second later Norman hear the sound of someone on the other end of a phone. The man that entered the restroom wasn't a custodian at all. He was on the phone. Norman felt embarrassed that he had replied to someone that wasn't speaking to him and waited until the man had left the restroom to exit the stall. 

Even though Norman was a little red, he thought that it was kind of a funny story and was excited to have a laugh with Norman when he returned home that afternoon.

</thread><thread title=[Norman Buys A Computer] author=[ALargeMoose] text=[Norman had been reading all about computers and the interesting things one might do with them in his magazines. 

"I ought to get one for myself," Norman thought. 

Norman called the local purveyor of such items and asked for one to be set up in his home. A young man came and installed the computer with the internet quite quickly and left without saying much, which secretly caused Norman a great deal of relief.

Norman sat down at his brand new computer. 

Norman wondered what he ought to do first. He had read about a website where you can search for anything. He decided this would be his first stop.

In the search bar, Norman typed "noemsn." 

"Oh, that isn't right," Norman muttered sheepishly. He glanced around to make sure Norman hadn't seen.

Norman hit the backspace key four times, then typed "rman." 

"Much better," he thought.

He clicked on the search button, and after learning a great deal about a town in Oklahoma and European history, he saw a result for a strange looking website. He had never heard of this website in the book he had rented from the library that was due in three days called "101 Safe and Educational Websites." 

"What an adventure!", he thought as he clicked on the website. He was a bit nervous, though he would never admit it. Downstairs, on the couch, Norman sneezed twice.

On this website, Norman found a number of strange stories about another man named Norman. In fact, Norman seemed to recognize a number of the circumstances being described in the stories.

"How peculiar," Norman thought. However, with adrenaline still surging from clicking on the website, Norman thought he might add a story of his own. He recounted his adventure of buying a computer and exploring all the interesting things it had to offer.

On the digital clock on the desk to his left, Norman noticed as the time changed from 7:26 to 7:27 PM.

"That's enough for today," Norman thought. He had already spent 12 minutes on the computer and was mildly disappointed in himself for having wasting so much time. He pressed six different buttons before the computer shut off.

The next week, Norman got rid of his computer.

</thread><thread title=[Norman Gets Testy] author=[Castriff] text=[Norman stood in the hallway, briefcase in hand, with the distinct impression that he had forgotten something important. He racked his brain for a moment, trying to remember. Nothing came to him.

Lisa raced up behind him, spinning around with an unusually high amount of energy. "Come on, Norman! Aren't you ready to go in?"

Norman looked around anxiously. "Go in?" 

Lisa leaned forward. Before Norman knew what was going on, she had both her arms around Norman's shoulders, one foot off the floor, leaning on him with a degree of comfort she'd never displayed before.

"Today's the big day," she whispered in his ear. "You are ready, aren't you?"

Norman pulled back. "Ready for what?"

"You goof. Come on, it's starting." Lisa grabbed Norman by the arm and dragged him in through the double doors.

Inside, there were dozens of young adults taking their seats. Lisa led him up the stairs of the auditorium, finding two empty seats in the very last row. Norman sat down, still uncertain as to what was going on. He looked down on the rest of the room until his eyes finally caught on the large chalkboard installed on the front wall.

"FINAL EXAM TODAY" it said, in capital letters etched a yard tall in white chalk.

Norman began to sweat. How had he forgotten something so devastatingly important? He looked down at his desk and realized that his exam was already there. He rifled through it. Calculus symbols swam before his eyes.

"Didn't you study, Norman?" He became aware that Lisa was leaning over in her seat, inspecting his paper more than her own. Norman shook his head. Surreptitiously, Lisa slid her paper as far to the edge of her desk as she dared. 

"I'll let you copy off me," she whispered. "Just this once."

"What? No." Norman pushed her test back. "That's not right, Lisa. Cheating is terrible."

"Suit yourself!" Norman watched in shock and awe as Lisa climbed up to stand on top of her desk. "Hey, everyone! Guess who didn't study!"

The entire class turned to face Lisa, then Norman, as she pointed. Before long, everyone was laughing. Norman blushed in acute embarrassment as the professor stood in the front of the room.

"Norman! Come down here!"

Norman stood, and shouldered his way between the desks as the students continued to laugh. In his haste, the strap of his briefcase caught on a chair and ripped itself off, forcing him to carry it with both hands. He got to the aisle and made his way down to the front of the room.

"Norman, I am giving you an F in this class. Leave now, and don't come *back to Vivaldi and Beethoven in our Classics in Concert series, tonight at 8...*
***
Norman awoke to the soft spoken voice of the classical radio station to which he'd set his alarm. He sat up in bed and wiped his face. *It was only a dream,* he thought to himself.

By the time Norman had finished his breakfast, he could barely remember what the dream had been about. Still, he kept a wary eye on Lisa in the line for morning coffee in the office.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4defpd/norman_gets_testy/] createDate=[1459851471] score=[93] numComments=[7]>

Norman's belly rumbled. "I'm alright Tom. Thank you though."

"C'mon, Norman. They're really good," Tom goaded.

Norman inspected the can. *Uncle Blasty’s Salted Nuts.* He was in no mood for sodium and he didn’t like Tom pressuring him. Just the thought of all that salt was making him ill. He could taste an ocean of brine wash over his tongue. It poured down his throat and began filling his lungs.   “No really, I’m alright. Thanks Tom.”

“Suit yourself,” Tom said coolly, turning his attention to his next victim. “Hey Denise! Care for a peanut?”

Norman slipped his headphones on. Outside his cubicle he heard a *pop* and a shriek, followed by the swell of laughter. *Why can’t you ever just be a part of something?* he thought to himself.

"Morning." Norman said to the secretary. She mumbled something that Norman assumed was "morning" too.

Frank, Norman's coworker whom Norman shared a cubicle with, was particularly quiet today. He didn't say anything all day; not saying "hello", or "here's the daily memo, Norman", or "sorry", when Frank's chair bumped into Norman's as he left the cubicle at the end of the day. Perhaps tomorrow he could ask Frank what was the matter.

As Norman rested at home, finishing the day by brushing his teeth, a thought came to him- he said nothing today.

The only utterance was "morning" to the secretary... And nothing more. He felt it strange, and worrisome. Could he lose his voice by not using it?

</thread><thread title=[Norman finds hot cocoa.] author=[RioTheNinja] text=[Norman was feeling a little frisky when he stepped into the kitchen. Norman meowed, slipping between the man's leg. Smiling, Norman stooped to brush his cat's head.

"Alright, I'll refill your food bowl in a little bit," he told Norman. "I just want to get something to drink first." Norman purred, pressing his head up against Norman's hand.

Norman stood back up, ignoring the protest that his back ached. *I wonder if I should tell the doctor about that,* he thought to himself but dismissed it as a gift of aging. He stepped toward the cupboard where he kept his mugs.

The metal was cold in his hand as Norman pulled it open. Past the three plain white mugs was a small box that said "Powdered Hot Cocoa". It had been an impulse buy almost a year ago, and he had yet to open it. Smiling at the memory of drinking hot chocolate when he was a child, Norman pulled the box off the shelf. It was not much bigger than his hand.

He set it down on the counter. Norman meowed. Norman turned and looked at his cat. *Maybe I can try this hot cocoa later,* thought Norman, putting the box back behind the mugs. *I should feed Norman.*] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5yt7gk/norman_finds_hot_cocoa/] createDate=[1489275694] score=[89] numComments=[6]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Gets a Christmas Card] author=[nana_had_a_fall] text=[Norman reached into his letter box and had his usual excitement over the possibilities of sales coupons and two-for-one offers. He dragged out a bundle of mail and carefully carried it back to his apartment.


"Lots of mail today," he boasted to Norman who was basking in the winter sun on the window ledge. 


Norman placed the stack of mail onto the kitchen table and hurried to put the kettle on. He had noticed amongst the pile a curious red envelope which did not at all seem to be a bill or a brochure, so he was certainly extra excited today. 


What could it be?


He got his favourite novelty mug out which had a delightful message written in cursive around it - **"Life Without Cats, I Don't Think So"**. Norman chuckled as he always did at this true and wonderful phrase while dropping two sugar cubes in the mug. 


He polished his reading glasses and placed the letter opener beside the stack, glimpsing again at the red envelope and becoming irritated that the kettle seemed to be taking forever to boil this morning. 


Finally, he made the tea and took a seat at the table. He took out all the brochures first, but today, instead of perusing them one by one and marking sales and coupons with his blue pen, he decided to go straight to the red envelope. 


It was addressed to him in large and somewhat messy handwriting, and there was a cheerful Christmas stamp at the corner of an ornamental tree beneath a snowy night. Norman made a mental note to keep the stamp for his collection before carefully severing the envelope with the letter opener. 


He pulled out a Christmas card which had on it a merry Santa Claus riding a sled with his reindeer. 


Norman's hands were shaking slightly as he opened the card. 


It read: 

Dear Norman

Seasons Greetings

Love from Eric. 



He stared at the card for a long time. Norman came into the kitchen and jumped up on to the table. Norman wiped a small tear from the corner of his eye so that Norman wouldn't see. 


That evening, Norman sat in his armchair and stared lovingly at the card which he had placed in the middle of the mantle piece. Santa clause was so happy and cheerful, his sleigh so full of presents for the children, and his reindeer so majestic in their night flights across the world. 

Norman purred in a contented ball on Norman's lap. 

It began snowing outside. 

"Merry Christmas, son" Norman said quietly. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5k5avm/norman_gets_a_christmas_card/] createDate=[1482645531] score=[89] numComments=[12]>

In fact, he couldn't quite remember the last time he had been there. Maybe when he was a kid. Dogs barked at him from every direction as the young, teenaged volunteer walked him past the cages telling him about the various dogs and their personalities.

"Kevin's a bit of a troublemaker," the young boy told him as they stood before a young lab, "but he's got a good heart. Just needs a little love is all. They all need a little love."

Norman nodded sympathetically. He knew well what it was like to need a little love. That feeling was the one that had driven him to consider adopting a dog.

At the end of the hallway, Norman saw an old dog, a collie, laying down in her kennel with its paws crossed. Norman knelt down beside the kennel and said, "Well aren't you a pretty girl." He looked into her sad eyes and it made him feel right at home.

"That's Norma," the volunteer said with a chuckle. "And you're Norman, right? Wouldn't that be a trip."

Norman knew he had to think quickly. He looked up and the man briefly made eye contact with him. They were just a few yards apart now.

Norman took a quick breath, stuffed his hands back in his pockets and gave the man a nod and half an awkward smile. He quickened his pace and walked right on past his stop.

Norman's heart sank. He didn't want to be the only one ordering dessert and hold the entire table up. Though he had spent the entire meal with that ice cream dish on his mind, he wasn't one to be a burden. "Just the check is fine, thank you." 

Norman and his friends split the check three ways, one of the guests had forgotten his wallet but they coordinated being compensated by him later in the week. 

In the parking lot all the friends shook hands and said their goodbyes. Norman got in his car and turned it on, waited for everyone to leave. 

Then he went back inside, sat at the bar and had the ice cream.

Norman turned out the light and allowed himself to drift towards a restful sleep. At around 9:25 pm, Norman awoke, startled, to a loud "bzzzz, bzzzz, bzzzz" coming from his cellular on the night stand. 

Slightly angry that his cell phone provider was sending him another set of payment reminders, Norman rose from bed and carried his cellular to the kitchen counter without ever reading the message. 

Norman had determined his cellular would never prevent him from a peaceful night of sleep.

Norman returned to slumber. He woke up in the morning, noticing he missed 10 minutes of good sleep. Norman got himself ready for work. He walked out the door and went about his day. 

At work, Leslie, a long time co-worker who always caught Norman's eye, approached him at his desk. Leslie asked Norman why he never messaged her back. She seemed sad. Norman reached in his pocket for his phone and soon realized he left it on the kitchen counter.

</thread><thread title=[Norman's Missing Meatball] author=[HansBrixOhNo] text=[Norman peeled back the plastic film from his Lean Cuisine spaghetti and meatballs, neatly folding the covering over on itself twice. He rested the film on the empty package that laid picture-side up on his counter; Norman knew spaghetti and meatballs meant five minutes in the microwave, and had long since foregone the "cook as directed" instructions. Resting both index fingers opposite the outer rim of his meal, Norman made his way to the couch. Norman slid his noodles from right to left in the tray, coating the dry noodles in spaghetti sauce. He took a bite. It was on this first bite - all spaghetti - that Norman realized his dinner contained only four meatballs. 

It had certainly not gone unnoticed to Norman in 2014 when Lean Cuisine reduced the number of meatballs from six to five. At first Norman thought this was a once-off oversight. It had not been. 

After dinner, as Norman washed his fork, he couldn't help his mind from wandering. He hoped this wasn't 2014 all over again.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4coqvt/normans_missing_meatball/] createDate=[1459431885] score=[85] numComments=[7]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman watches CSI] author=[StoneEd05] text=[Norman was just sitting down to watch the new episode of CSI with his glass of milk and poured out the last of his saltine crackers onto his plate. He was always amazed by the detectives’ ability to take a seemingly impossible situation and break down the clues until they figured out who the culprit was. “They’re real life sleuths” he thought. Norman had always admired detectives for their seemingly super-human reason, and thought he would make a great one if only he had had the right schooling. “The police do a fine job though, and i wouldn’t want to get mixed up in a real investigation. Too risky if the criminals go after me like they do in the show sometimes.” Half way through the episode, the detectives were just on the brink of a major discovery about one of their suspects when Norman heard Norman give a plaintive cry. Norman was hungry and his dinner bowl was empty. "How careless of me! I forgot to pick up Norman's food! I better go to the store right away so Norman can eat”. He briefly considered waiting until the episode was over but then thought better so he turned off the tv and rushed to the store. In the checkout line, Norman thought to himself “This is actually great. I still don’t know who committed the crime, so now when this episode re-runs in a few weeks it will be like I’m watching it for the first time!”. Norman paid up and thanked the cashier with a smile, but as he was leaving he forgot that he had run out of saltines. “Thats ok“ Norman thought, “Norman needs his dinner and i have oatmeal at home" ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5mepq1/norman_watches_csi/] createDate=[1483751167] score=[86] numComments=[1]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Takes the Bus] author=[MelodyCristo] text=[Norman woke up at exactly 6:00 in the morning. He showered, shaved, got dressed, and came downstairs to make breakfast.

Norman fed Norman a can of his favorite cat food, then made himself a bowl of Cheerios. He ate slowly so he'd enjoy it, but not too slowly so it wouldn't get too soggy.

Once Norman finished his breakfast and washed the bowl, he walked out to his car to drive to work.

"Oh yeah," Norman muttered. "The windshield."

Norman's windshield had been cracked the day before when someone didn't approve of his parking job. With a cracked windshield, Norman felt it would be unsafe to try driving, so he walked to the bus station.

The bus was two minutes late, and passengers were scattered throughout the seats. Norman sat in the seat closest to where he came in, which just happened to be near an attractive woman who was reading a book. Norman made sure to leave a buffer seat between them.

The woman looked up. "Hi." She smiled.

"Hi." Norman replied, without looking at her.

"My name is Sarah." Sarah offered.

"Norman." Norman mumbled.

"What's your name?" Sarah asked after a moment. She must not have heard him.

"Norman." Norman said, a little louder this time.

"That's a nice name."

"Thank you."

They sat in silence until Sarah came to her stop. "Nice talking to you. Bye, Norman!"

"Bye."

Norman decided to leave two buffer seats from then on.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5q9udl/norman_takes_the_bus/] createDate=[1485461880] score=[86] numComments=[3]>

He was telling his audience of two people about the summer vacation he had recently taken. He recounted his visit to a duck farm on one of his road trips. Norman wasn’t normally inclined to tell his own stories, because people never paid him much attention anyway.

Norman began to get excited as the two began to ask him questions about his road trip. So excited, in fact, that he slurred a couple of his words. Norman didn’t immediately realise he’d unintentionally spooned the words ‘duck’ and ‘farm’.

Norman’s audience grinned and shared glances when he accidentally uttered “f**k darm”.

Norman’s cheeks blushed a rich red. He couldn’t believe he had voiced such vulgar language.

Norman made a quiet excuse to return to his desk cubical and decided he wouldn’t be visiting the water cooler again that day.

</thread><thread title=[Norman attends a party] author=[imrepairmanman] text=[Norman decided he would finally attend the office christmas party, and as such he made sure that he would be fully prepared when the time arrived. He bought a special christmas sweater, and a festive hat which came with a bauble at the end of it(something norman would normally never do). He was certainly going to be extremely festive.

The day of the party arrived, and Norman was in high spirits. He arrived at the party 15 minutes late, exactly as his father had told him to do in cases like these. He had done his homework beforehand, and it occurred to him that his father actually was right about the timing of these things. Normally Norman would show up exactly on time, but his father had informed him that most people will not be there at that time, and it will be very awkward.

At the party, Norman started saying hello and talking to all of the coworkers that were already there. He made some friendly chatter about the weather and office going-ons, and generally had a pleasant time. Some people even complimented his special sweater, which made Norman very happy.

A little later, Norman was feeling thirsty, so he went to get a glass of punch. He made sure to check beforehand with the people that were setting up as to which of the drinks were non-alcoholic. After confirming that there was a non-alcoholic punch, and which one it was specifically(it was the darker red of the two), he was feeling safe that he would not accidentally get intoxicated.

Just as he arrived at the bowls though, Lisa approached him. Norman said hello, and tried to hold back the enormous smile that wanted to come out, instead only letting his regular, more reserved smile show. Lisa started complimenting Norman on his sweater, and Norman complimented her dress, and then the two of them entered into a conversation.

Lisa then offered to fill Norman's cup for him, to which Norman happily obliged. Unbeknownst to Norman, however, she filled it from the alcoholic punch, as she did not know that Norman had an incredibly low alcohol tolerance. After thanking Lisa for the favor and taking a large gulp, he noticed the sharp twang of alcohol in his drink, and started panicking internally.

Trying to keep calm, he said to Lisa that he must go, and that he was incredibly sorry about leaving so abruptly. Norman managed to make it home before the effects of the alcohol really set in, but around his house he was stumbling like a drunkard(because he was a drunkard). Norman also almost tripped over Norman, which would have been terrible, as Norman only has hardwood flooring in his house. Norman managed to stumble his way out of his clothing and into bed, and Norman followed him slightly after.

The next morning Norman woke up with one of the worst headaches of his life, and a deep feeling of regret.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4x9ozj/norman_attends_a_party/] createDate=[1470971049] score=[83] numComments=[7]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Meets a New Friend] author=[MattressCrane] text=[In between the bus stop and Norman's apartment complex is a house, and in the front lawn of that house is an old black Labrador. The path wasn't the most efficient route- by taking this route, he ended up walking an extra two blocks each day. Each day, when Norman passes the dog on the walk to the bus stop, he would lay down his briefcase on the sidewalk. In a small compartment, beside his spot for pens, is a spot for little dog treats. The old Labrador's tail would wag happily every time Norman strolled by, without fail, giving the dog a little treat.
But one day the dog was not outside. Norman was worried, but figured that it perhaps had to do with the rain that was falling earlier that morning. He tried not to let it bother him.

As weeks passed, Norman realized the dog would not be coming back to sit outside. The treats in the little compartment were going stale. Norman sighed heavily each day he went down the block, and finally decided that there isn't any point to taking this route anymore. He returned to the regular routine.


As Norman walked down the new street, he passed by a house- and an old golden retriever sitting idly on the front lawn. Norman opened his briefcase.

He decided to finish the last few documents Allan had sent to him before worrying about it.

*Its not like I asked for it*, Norman reasoned to himself. *But I couldn't exactly turn down Ed's offer, could I have? ...Could I have?*

Finally, 4:00 rolled around and Norman hesitantly fished some change out of his front right pocket. He considered a dime, a nickle, and a penny, but finally settled on the quarter. Sliding the ticket closer, he read he needed three cherries to win the thousand dollars. Again the foreboding nearly overcame Norman. Cherries gave him indigestion. Norman gathered his courage. He softly scratched at the ticket until an apple, an eggplant, and what appeared to be a squash were revealed.

Norman let out a sigh of relief. With the thousand dollars, he could finally order that magazine he had wanted.

</thread><thread title=[Norman gets an invitation.] author=[Gangster_Gandhi] text=[Norman woke to to the soft beeping of his daily alarm. He knew it was a Saturday, but this kept him tuned in to his weekday schedule. Today, however, Norman treated himself to a rare Saturday treat and snoozed his alarm.   

The alarm beeped 9 minutes later and Norman sat up, feeling adequately refreshed. He slipped out of bed, into his house slippers, and krept past a sleeping Norman, so as not to disturb his Saturday morning sleep. Once he was out of Norman's earshot, Norman broke into a reasonably paced walk. 

He walked by the counter in the kitchen and realized the mail he usually left on the counter the night before, was not there. He must've forgotten the mail when he got home from work yesterday. He decided not to possibly wake Norman by going into his room to get appropriate clothes for going outside, so he risked going out in his pajamas.  

Norman opened his front door and walked to his mail box. He opened it and saw three pieces of mail. What a treat. The back piece of mail was a large thick envelope. Norman realized he would have to get through the other two pieces of mail, before getting to reveal this final envelope. He felt a flutter of anticipation, because it looked like a rather nice envelope.   

The first parcel was an advertisement from Geiko. Norman read it curiously and noted how good of a deal it was. But that gecko was a little too talkative for Normans taste.   

He moved on to the second letter. It was from an electricity company Norman had heard of.  TO : Current Resident.  This must be for me, Norman thought. He opened it with his letter opener. As he politely read the letter, he began to answer the question posed in it. Was he happy with his current electricity company? Yes, he was. The letter said if he was, to read no further. Norman, always respectful of people's wishes, folded the letter and read no further.   

Finally, the fancy envelope. Norman looked to see who it was from and felt his curiosity less than sated. It appeared someone had dropped the envelope in some winter slush and the return address was smudged and unreadable.   This was addressed directly to him. His name was handwritten neatly across the front of the cream colored envelope. He turned it over, noting a cute little sticker on the envelopes seal, though it was completely unnecessary as the envelope had also been sealed shut, but Norman appreciated the gesture. He opened the card and pulled it out. It was covered in pictures of balloons and smiles, YOU'RE INVITED blared across the top of the card, and Norman felt himself break out into a sweat, unsure if he wanted to be invited to whatever this was. He read the next line:  to schedule your next appointment with Dr Davis! It's almost been 6 months!  

Dr Davis was Normans new dentist, since his last one had decided to move to orthodontia.  Norman realized it had been a while since he'd had his teeth cleaned. He gave them a call to schedule and was greeted by their kind voice mail explaining they're closed on Saturdays. He smiled, hoping that all have a good weekend.

Enthused about his satisfactory performance at the office, she suggested a Saturday afternoon trip to the local hardware and home stores in order to purchase something for the home in celebration of his continued competence.  Although Norman knew the stores were quite busy on Saturday afternoons, he didn't want to be one to let his wife down, and smiled halfheartedly at the idea.

Having arrived in the parking lot at the hardware store, Norman's wife suggested he go in alone so she could get a head start at the houseware store.  Somewhat caught off guard by her uncharacteristic desire for efficiency, he let out a genuine sigh of relief, knowing that he would be able to browse the hardware store's limited and simple selection of picture frames in private.  The frame housing the picture of their son's baseball team was far too gaudy for Norman's taste.

Norman selected a frame that was quite pleasing to him; although made from the more expensive oak and featuring a walnut stain, he was surprised to see it was on sale and was soon walking towards the houseware store on the other side of the complex, frame in hand.

After circling the store several times, Norman was unable to locate his wife.  He had already sent her one text message regarding his purchase and didn't want to bother her with further messages.  The anxiety he was feeling made him shift uneasily in the bedding department.  Norman closed his eyes and remembered the teachings of the book his wife gave him for his last birthday. 'Mastering Your Insecurities' always said that anxiety is just the fear of the unknown, and what Norman needs to do is remember that things always work out in the end, just like his wife had told him to remember.  

"She's always so unpredictable" Norman admited to himself, something he disliked about her but not as much as he disliked himself for feeling such contempt for her.  "She'll be back soon, she knows I will be here, and she will be apologetic, just like she always is".

Minutes passed and finally Norman's cellphone came to life with his wife's specific text message notification.  He opened his flip phone, palms sweaty: "Have you made it to the houseware store yet? I'm in the kitchen department".  Odd, he thought to himself, he had been there at least three times.  Relief rushed over Norman as he laid eyes on his beloved browsing the selection of spatchulas.  "I thought I'd lost you" Norman confessed.

"Oh Norman, I'm so sorry it took you this long to find me, you know I've been telling you to get your glasses checked." Of course she was right, it was just like he read earlier how vision always drops off at the age of 45.  She was always right; "Yes dear, perhaps I should book an appointment with Dr. Buttle next Saturday" he suggested.  

Norman noticed his wife's mood change at the mention as she momentarily fought back a smile.  Without breaking her gaze from the display of utensils, she replied: "Of course dear, I'll make the appointment myself.  Wouldn't want you to forget now would we?"  Norman was quick to agree as he was eager to move the conversation to their new picture frame.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5fqhpi/norman_loses_his_wife/] createDate=[1480551859] score=[84] numComments=[10]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Makes a Bet] author=[SnoopTidder] text=[It was Wednesday morning and it was raining. Norman sat at his adequate dining table, drinking a lukewarm cup of coffee, as he watched the raindrops course down the kitchen window in contemplative silence. 

Norman felt a familiar tug at the hem of his trousers. "Good morning Norman!" said Norman. Norman was feeling particularly good this morning and his enthusiastic greeting prompted a soft meow from Norman. 

Norman glanced back at the rain laced window, watching each raindrop race down to the sill at the bottom and suddenly an idea struck him. With a grin Norman looked across at Norman who had planted himself on the dining table. "I bet my raindrop can reach the bottom before your raindrop Norman" said Norman with glee. 

Norman regarded Norman and meowed in agreement. Norman hastily chose two raindrops and made his way to the kitchen counter to get a better view of the 'race'. 

"Mine's winning!" Exclaimed a delighted Norman. Norman had never won anything in his life, but he was about to break his losing streak. 

Moments later, Normans raindrop collided with another, and was absorbed instantly. Norman watched as Norman's raindrop meandered slowly down to the bottom of the window and returned to his adequate dining table to drink his lukewarm coffee with a sigh. 

"Congratulations Norman" said Norman, "I never was much of a gambling man..." He added  as he checked his watch and prepared to leave for work. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4sm3dw/norman_makes_a_bet/] createDate=[1468427258] score=[84] numComments=[7]>

"I think I'll get something healthy for myself today" thought Norman, as he reached for the Chicken, Lettuce and Mayonnaise sandwich. 

Norman felt good about his purchase. He sat on a bench outside the shop which had a piece of A4 paper stuck to the side of it, which was covered in green paint making the writing illegible.. 

Norman opened his sandwich and noticed the lettuce was quite yellow. 

He took one bite and then placed the sandwich down. He parted the bread slices and removed the lettuce. 

This tasted much better, but wasn't anywhere near the health kick that Norman felt he needed. 

Norman finished his sandwich and stood up from the bench, failing to notice that his sensible beige jacket and brown pants were now coated in the new green bench color.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4vf0my/norman_goes_on_a_health_kick/] createDate=[1469956989] score=[81] numComments=[4]>

As he headed out of the office building, he stopped briefly to get a soda (something he didn’t usually drink, but he figured that he deserved it), then got into his car and started home on his usual route. As he neared the end of the road, he approached the four-way stop. Now, the four-way stop was something of a stressor for Norman, as it was usually busy, and he would often roll up to the stop sign at about the same time as the other cars, and he was never entirely sure who should go first. Today, however, the traffic was quite light, and as he rolled up to the stop sign, he found, to his excitement, that he was the only one, and that he was free to go right ahead with no worries. Norman smiled, his stressful day already forgotten.

</thread><thread title=[Norman's New Dawn (sorry, a bit long, but I'm content with it)] author=[rhowaldt] text=[The beast loomed, yet the air was still. All these people that had gathered here, and from them not a single scream was heard, nor a broken cry, nee, not even a breathless whisper escaped their lips. He couldn't believe it. Were they really oblivious to the terror so rapidly approaching them? How were they able to sit there so casually, on the field of grass, with the picnic blanket and the sleeping dogs? He felt like the only man alive, yet unable to make a difference as he could feel the giant feet soundlessly come nearer.

As he stood there, his feet rooted to the ground, he realized that to continue this silence was to continue the beast. He tried to scream, but his voice wasn't there. As his body failed him, his mind jumped into action. The determined focus that had been a part of him for as long as he could remember, that often burdensome quality which seemed to make him a bore to the world, was suddenly hard at work. He closed his eyes and listened. The quiet now seemed almost overwhelming, but his focus had grown so strong that even the thought of a sound made the tiny hairs in his ears tingle.

And there it was. At first it was less than a whisper. But with continuing attention it grew louder, until it was like a breeze. Louder, and a memory clicked in place: he saw the waves crashing into the shore and heard their gentle swooshing. Louder still it grew, as he started walking towards the ocean, that now seemed to beckon him with its sloshing call. He started running, arms swinging wildly around his body, his mind entranced by the pull of the waves. He ran into the surf and fell to his knees. He reached his arms up to the heavens, opened his mouth and let out a cry of desperation, "POSEIDON!".

As the waves gently engulfed him he saw how the heavens opened, and a bright white light appeared that grew bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and biggger and biiggher ant bijghjerrrrrr bjghrrrrrr, bjghrrrrr, bjghrrrrr, bjghrrrruurrhhrhrh ugh.

Norman scratched his head. It was still dark outside. The Ocean alarm tone was nice, he thought, but he should really switch off the vibrate function. Still drowsy, he clicked through the app's settings to find it. There it was, under "Advanced". The word made him think: was this really the smartest thing to do? And so early in the morning? His father always used to say, "If it won't work easily, don't force it". This decision did not feel easy. Norman pressed the "Home" button, closed the app, and locked his phone. "Why am I on my phone first thing in the morning?", he asked himself. "That's not a healthy way to start the day". This got him thinking about healthy ways to start the day, health food, vegans, alternative medicine, the New Age movement, and he suddenly thought of a colleague of his who was always talking about dreams, and finding meaning in them. He wasn't sure whether any of that was true or not, but he had so far found himself unable to explain what exactly dreams are.

He remembered being in a dream, but forgot what it was about. Something to do with being boring and everything was quiet. He tried closing his eyes, as his colleague had told him, to get back into the dream state. This sounded very appealing, and so he dozed off for a moment, until a sudden thought, "Work!", awoke him with a shock. "I'll think about the dream later", Norman said to himself, his voice sounding somewhat determined.

As soon as he poured the milk over his cornflakes, he had forgotten about it.

The server drops off the menu. Norman flips anxiously through the pages of the leather-bound menu. Back and forth, back and forth. Shepherd's pie special, fish, or a classic burger? What were the sides again? 

He settles on the fish and closes the menu carefully around his finger so he can quickly flip back to the right page when the server returns. Sipping his ice water, he surveys the room. 

Norman notices a man in the corner booth rise from his seat, waving excitedly for the server. The man's rapidly reddening face seems a bit swollen. He frantically pats his neck and chest. 

This is it! Norman pulls his laptop bag up onto the table, digging for the epipen he carries for such occasions. Norman doesn't have any serious allergies, but he has always thought it best to be sure.

As Norman frees the epipen from its carrying case, he hesitates. The pen expired nearly a year ago. Will it still work? The gorgeous hostess races into the room with a first aid kit and saves the day. The pub patrons cheer for her. An ambulance arrives and leaves with the greatly relieved and puffy man. 

Norman replaces his bag beneah the table. Lisa arrives and she and Norman watch the ambulance pull away. He tells her the thrilling story and leaves the staff an extra large tip.

Later that evening, Norman sits alone at the table, epipen in hand, practicing on an orange. He nicks the tabletop slightly - that's a long needle!

</thread><thread title=[Norman's Pleasant Dream] author=[QuincyHarvey] text=[Norman woke up from his dream slowly, and unwillingly, and yet somehow all at once with the blare of his alarm. As he slowly adjusted to the sight of the stained ceiling hanging over him and his knobbly toes sticking out from the end of the  blanket, he let out an almost inaudible whimper of defeat.

He had just been with his ex wife and son at the beach. In the dream of course. They'd never actually been to the beach. But in the dream they had. In the dream she was wearing the same red sweater she had worn the day they had first met (entirely inappropriate beach attire, Norman noted.) Norman Jr. was just a boy, six or seven - right before the resentment grew between the two of them. Norman could never remember when exactly his relationship with his son fell apart. It seemed like the void had always been there, but that could hardly be so, could it?

In the dream they were happy - Norman and his wife sitting cuddled together on a picnic blanket watching their son dash around madly in the surf. As Norman lay in his cold bed he could still feel the warm sunlight on his skin. He had to go back! If he didn't go back the whole day at the beach would fade away in his mind until he was all alone again.

He slammed his alarm off and closed his eyes furiously, trying desperately to fall back asleep. His wife had been about to say something too. It felt important and he had to hear it. All of Norman's muscles tensed, as if he could push himself down through the bed into the warm furrows of sleep, and back to his family.

But he couldn't. It was gone. The dream was over, and Norman couldn't fall back asleep. Cars were driving past, sloshing in the rain, and birds were cawing raucously like witches finding great amusement in his struggle. The sun shone through Norman's budget curtains, painting his tightly-clenched eyelids a bright red.

Norman sighed, and let out a long moan. Then, he dragged himself out of bed and caught the bus to work. He was two hours late but today Norman didn't care.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4kznbw/normans_pleasant_dream/] createDate=[1464211971] score=[80] numComments=[3]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman makes some lunch] author=[mitchboucher1994] text=[It was a rainy Saturday afternoon. Glancing out the window and sighing, he put his newspaper on the coffee table. Such a gloomy day. Slowly he rose from his reclining chair; a few seconds from now Norman would no doubt climb into it and fall asleep.

He walked into the kitchen and got some bread, butter, cheese, and a frying pan. Turning the stove on, he regarded the flames and how they contrasted the clouds outside. He buttered the bread, let the cheese settle; after flipping it with a spatula the sandwich was done in a few minutes. He poured himself a glass of water.


Strolling back into the living room, he found Norman curled up and fast asleep in his chair. Slightly annoyed, but still loving the cat, he grabbed his paper and settled at the kitchen table. The rain continued to pour outside as Norman ate; wiping crumbs off his chin, he sat, satisfied.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/605jy2/norman_makes_some_lunch/] createDate=[1489890244] score=[82] numComments=[6]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman has a cold] author=[PaxSum] text=["You really got it good, don't you?" laughs John when Norman passes his desk to throw another paper towel in the bin. 

"I guess so." Norman says, unsure what exactly John means by 'good' in this context.

"Yeah, it has been going around. Lisa had the flu last week and just today Mo called in sick too. I guess it's the weather."

"Maybe." It had been rather cold the past days.

"Well, as long as you don't give it to me!" John laughs and turns back to his computer screen.

Norman quickly walks back to his desk. John has a point, Norman should be more careful not to spread his cold to him. There is another trash can two cubicles over. It is a longer walk, but it is better to be save than sorry.

That evening Norman measures his temperature. The thermometer displays 37.3 ºC in big black numbers. 

"Better not to risk it, I will call in sick tomorrow." Norman says to Norman, who is purring on his lap. Norman thinks about what John said. Hopefully he did not catch the cold. He blows his nose again. 

"Yes, it is better to stay in bed tomorrow." he says to no-one in particular, while he turns the tv on for the CSI reruns.

Norman pulled out his Nokia flip phone that he had recieved as a present in 2004. (Norman takes moderately good care of his things so his phone hasn't needed replacing yet.)

</thread><thread title=[Norman gets a cupcake] author=[niobiumnnul] text=[As Debbie drove toward the daycare facility, she couldn't help but feel a twinge of guilt for dumping her work on Norman.  
*Sweet Norman*, she thought, *he is always so kind and helpful. I could probably dump all of my work on him and he would do it...*  
She shook the thought from her head and resolved to thank Norman by bringing him a cupcake from that new place over on 6th Street - the one with the giant cupcakes and enough icing to induce a sugar coma.  
Debbie picked up her son, finished up the evening, and put him to bed by 8:00. Her sister, Pam, was in town visiting, so Debbie told her the plan.  
"That's nice," Pam said absently, "but who cares if he does your work for you...?" Pam was not the type to extend thanks.  
Debbie noticed the time and hurried to the shop. She picked out a red velvet cupcake with cream cheese icing.  
*He will like this*, she thought, *he seems to enjoy sweets.*  
She knew he would still be at the office, finishing up. That is just the type of person Norman is.  
She parked and hustled toward the office. She rounded the corner and saw Norman. It looked as though he was heading home. Just then, she saw a scantily-clad girl talking to Norman. Debbie looked her up and down, and even in the dark of the night, she knew this woman was not asking Norman if he wanted to go to church.  
Debbie heard Norman mumble something about work and he began walking in the other direction.  
"Norman!" she yelled and picked up her pace. "Hey, Norman!"  
Norman turned to see who was calling name and smiled when he saw Debbie.  
"Hi, Debbie. How is your son?" he asked.  
"Oh, he is good. He is asleep now. My sister is in town for a few weeks, so she is with him." Debbie looked at the box in her hand.  
"Anyway, Norman, I wanted to give you a little 'thank you' for covering for me so I can pick him up from daycare every once in a while." She presented the box to him.  
"It's a cupcake from that new place over on 6th Street. Their cupcakes are soooo good."  
Norman opened the box and saw sweet deliciousness staring back at him.  
"Thanks, Debbie. You didn't have to go to all this trouble, but I appreciate it. This looks great!" he said.  
"Do you know that girl?" Debbie motioned in the direction of the lady with questionable morals.  
Norman felt himself blush. "No. No, I do not know her."  
"I didn't think so," Debbie said, "Would you like a ride home?"  
"No thanks, I like the subway." Norman knew his public transportation would be more environmentally sound than the extra trip for Debbie's car.  
"Thanks for the cupcake, Debbie. Have a good weekend!" Norman smiled and waved goodbye. He headed toward the subway and thought about all of that icing.  
Maybe he would give Norman a little bite.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4kq07f/norman_gets_a_cupcake/] createDate=[1464063929] score=[76] numComments=[5]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman finds an unexpected entryway] author=[Sophira] text=[It was finally the weekend. Norman felt like this week, his work had been particularly exhausting; he'd handed in his latest report and immediately been assigned another. It felt like the company was just using him, and he felt like he should ask for a raise. He resolved to seriously consider it over the weekend, just like he had done for the past six months.

First, though, he needed to get home and rest. He clocked out, left the building, and started to make his way to the parking garage.

On the way, he stopped. One of the big stores he'd just passed had left its side door open that led onto the street. He'd walked this route many times and seen the door, but had never seen it left open. *Maybe some of the employees are loading stock*, he thought. He decided to hang around for a while and see what happened.

After waiting ten seconds and seeing nobody go in or out, he thought about the idea of going in the door himself and getting to see what secrets lay therein. Already from his vantage point across the street he could see a metal staircase, and he wondered where it would lead. His mind raced with the possibilities.

He then realized that it was probably a bad idea to get involved; he might run into people who would ask him to leave, and that would be pretty embarrassing. Grudgingly (but with more than a hint of relief), he turned to leave.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4cne6g/norman_finds_an_unexpected_entryway/] createDate=[1459409026] score=[75] numComments=[2]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman gets Earth-conscious] author=[-XCIII-] text=[Norman entered his local grocery store again. He browsed the aisles for the usual can of food for Norman. As he was perusing, he noticed the store was having a sale on perishables. Blood rushing to his head, he filled his trolley with milk, eggs, bread, and a jar of grape jam that, while not on sale, he was *sure* he had a coupon for in his billfold. Carefully taking his wallet out, he peered inside. There were 3 coupons: a buy-one-get-one-free offer for an off-brand detergent that made his clothes scratchy, an expired newspaper clipping that advertised 5$ off of an extra large pizza from his favorite pizza place, and - **THERE!** - a coupon for ¢50 off of grape jam.

Smiling, Norman carefully placed the jar in the back of the trolley. He made sure not to forget Norman's food on the next aisle over, and made his way to the cashier. A large, greasy-faced teenager greeted him unenthusiastically. After ringing up Norman's items, he asked "Paper or plastic, sir?" Norman was about to tell him that he brought his own bag, but froze. He didn't remember bringing it with him. He tried to think quickly, so as to avoid an embarrassing encounter. He had too many heavy items for a paper bag, he thought. "Those bags are so flimsy, surely they would tear open as I'm walking home," He muttered to himself. He started to announce that he would like a plastic bag, until he remembered a commercial he saw during a CSI rerun earlier in the week. It had a cute puppy running around with a little girl, while a female narrator talked about the importance of recycling. Would the cashier think less of him for choosing a harmful plastic bag?

Without saying a word, Norman scooped up his purchases in his arms and quickly walked out the door. "That was close" he said, to no one in particular. It was a lovely November day outside. The wind was blowing ever so slightly, and there was a beautiful sunset just over the horizon.

He sat down in the chair and the dentist passed him some sunglasses. 

Norman didn't care for the sunglasses. When the seat was tilted back they kept falling from his face. The light above was very bright and the dentist seemed to want to hurt Norman more than he wanted to help him. 

"Open wider please Norman" the dentist requested, while scratching at Norman's gums and prodding the top of his teeth. 

Norman obliged. 

"Got plans for the weekend?" asked the dentist. 

Norman didn't care much for the small talk while there was important work for the dentist to do, but he replied anyway. 

"Aahhh gahwaaah haaaaoo aaa hagaaa" said Norman. 

Norman pondered over what he had said. He wondered if the dentist understood any of it and he felt silly having even tried to talk with the dentist working. 

Norman decided to remain silent for the remainder of the encounter, only breaking the silence for a small "aha" or "ah-ah" when asked yes or no questions. 

After what seemed like an eternity, the dentist was done. 

"It looks like you just need to floss a little more, Norman. Otherwise, everything looks fairly good"

Norman was very proud to hear that his teeth were fine. 

"Thank you." he said to the dentist, as he paid and left. 

On his way home, Norman stopped at the shops to pick up dinner. He grabbed for a candy bar as a treat but then thought better of it - after all, Norman didn't want his teeth to be ruined. 

Norman went home, sat down and though about what a great day he'd had.

It was Debbie, and she was walking toward him.
"I'm gonna head out early. You don't mind finishing my last 2 reports, right hun?" she said.

Norman sighed. Debbie's face was smiling as she looked down on him. Norman, silent for a few seconds, stared at her glasses and soccer mom-style haircut. 

"I- uh can't tonight Debbie, I'm really sorry. I really have to rush to the store to pick something up for my friend before it closes" Norman said calmly. 

Debbie's left eyebrow raised. "You sure you can't, hun?" she said more sternly. "Yeah, again I'm sorry Debbie!" Norman replied.

"Okay, thanks anyway hun" said Debbie as she walked back in the direction of her desk.

Despite his urge to go to lunch early, he decided that the thirty seconds until lunch would be better spent working.
When his lunch break finally started, according to schedule, Norman jumped up from his chair, pulled the chair in, and left for the refrigerator.
"Oh my." Norman noticed that Lisa was grabbing her tuna sandwich, despite being three minutes early. He felt guilty letting her speak to him.
"Hi Norman!" Norman nodded and opened the door to the refrigerator, hoping to avoid any further contact. 
"I bought something for you from New York! It's in my car. Would you want it?"
"I can't take her gift without proper compensation." Norman thought. "Sure!"
Lisa gave him a hat that said "I love New York" on it. 
Norman began to sweat. He had never been to New York, so he didn't know whether he loved it or not. On the other hand, Lisa would be disappointed if he didn't take the gift.
"Um.... Thanks." Norman took the gift and left.
After work, Norman put the hat on, thanked Lisa again, and then left in his yellow station wagon. He had to buy some cat food for Norman.
Norman, not realizing he still had the hat on, grabbed some cat food and went to pay for it. The cashier noticed his hat. "Nice hat! Cool place, isn't it?"
"Yeah, very cool."
Norman hurried out of the store, satisfied with the compliment, sweat beading at his brow.

</thread><thread title=[Norman tries something new] author=[loogawa] text=[Today was the first Friday of the month, and for Norman that could mean only one thing. It was half price salisbury steak day at the diner on the way home from work. The salisbury steak from this diner was one of Norman's favourite meals, and he had been looking forward to it all week. 

Sitting at the counter of the restaurant he waited for the older waitress to notice him. Her name was Helena and he liked her because she was always quite quick about filming his drink, but didn't constantly ask him how his meal was going while his mouth was full, forcing him to embarrass himself trying to answer. 

Helena asked Norman what she could get for him.  He asked for the usual, and she punched it in. It was only a few minutes later when a heavy set middle aged man with hairy knuckles and a grease-soaked apron laid a plate in front of him with a slight grunt. Norman looked apprehensively at the plate. It looked similar to his beloved salisbury steak, but instead of delightful ground beef he saw the shimmering rubbery skin of a fat slab of liver. 

He thought of getting Helen's attention, but she looked to be about to go on break. He didn't want to be a bother, it was silly of him to assume she remembered his regular order. He wasn't a very memorable person. 

After completing the liver, Norman was quite proud of himself for trying something new. Looking down at the empty, greasy plate he thought to himself that he most assuredly wouldn't be ordering that again. But he had tried it, he could be quite adventurous sometimes. 

When Helena returned with Norman's bill he noticed that she had charged him for the half price salisbury steak. When he went up to the till to pay the hairy-knuckled man he asked him to correct the bill.  He didn't want to dine and dash after all. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5g5x94/norman_tries_something_new/] createDate=[1480743224] score=[72] numComments=[1]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Finds a Kitten] author=[ejambu] text=[Norman awoke early on a Saturday morning and after a breakfast of whole wheat toast and grapefruit, quickly got down to business in his garden. It was the weekend, and that meant not only watering, but weeding and and trimming as well. 

Norman had just pulled out the hose and set his eyes on a particularly thirsty-looking rose bush when he noticed a small rustle beneath it's leaves. Norman bent down and found a small black kitten. He stared in surprise, not quite sure what to do with the little creature. 

Did it have a home? No collar. Was Norman somehow responsible for this kitten now that it had appeared in his yard? His mind quickly starting ticking through the repercussions. If it had no home, did he have an obligation to take it in? And if so, did he even have the time to devote to this furry ball of energy? Kittens certainly require more attention than a full grown cat like Norman. And speaking of Norman, what would he think? Could he risk making his beloved companion uncomfortable? Norman was certainly set in his lifestyle.

The kitten gamboled playfully around his feet. Despite his concerns, Norman had taken a liking to the little kitten. He stroked it behind the ears and was surprised to find it so eager for affection. Perhaps Norman could find a place in his home for this little guy after all. But what to call him...

Suddenly, the little neighbor girl came running across Norman's lawn. "Mr. Norman!," she cried! "Did you see my new kitty!?"

"I did!" Norman told her "He seems to have taken a liking to my rose bush."

"His name is Roger. I have to take him home," she said scooping up the little kitten in her arms. "See you later," she hollered, streaking off, the small black figure bobbing in her tiny arms.

"Ah well, it's probably for the best anyway," Norman sighed. "Norman is certainly enough to handle."] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4qg1jc/norman_finds_a_kitten/] createDate=[1467242122] score=[71] numComments=[5]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Takes a Walk Down Memory Lane] author=[ginger_pale_1805] text=[Norman rolls over to silence his alarm clock on this dreary Monday morning. He plants his feet on the floor, rubs the sleep out of his eyes, and musters up the determination to officially begin the day. 

He walks into the kitchen and begins his daily ritual of preparing breakfast: get the coffee maker going, make some oatmeal, and choose a fruit to eat with the oatmeal. Today, Norman chooses a banana. 

While slicing the banana, Norman glances up at the calendar on the wall and notices the date. While Norman does not boast having a good day-to-day memory, sometimes a random piece of his past finds its way to the forefront of his mind. "Huh, it's December 19th," Norman thinks to himself. "This is about the time Melinda and I first started getting serious."

It was the first finals week of their first semester of college, a whole week of firsts for the two freshmen. Melinda had just finished her last final for the semester, and Norman agreed to meet her in the local coffee shop for a celebratory caffeinated beverage. Although the past two weeks were stressful, Norman saw a noticeable difference in Melinda's countenance. Her smile was radiant, and her laughter was contagious once again. Norman felt like he was seeing her for the first time all over again. 

During a brief pause in the dialogue, Norman felt like the moment was just too right. The soft jazz playing over the speaker, her perfectly messy hair, her scarf a tangled mess around her neck, the genuine peace-with-the-world feeling he had in his heart - Norman felt truly alive in this moment, and bolder than he ever felt before.  If he did not say those three words now, he may never work up the courage to say them again. 

"Melinda, I love you."

She glanced up from her coffee with a surprised look on her face - a good kind of surprised. She smiled her crooked smile, and looked down at her coffee. Her cheeks turned the color of fresh-picked roses. 

"I love you too, Norman."

The coffee maker sighed as the last drops of coffee fell into the pot. Norman sighed along with it, feeling the weight of reality starting to creep back onto his shoulders. "Oh, well," said Norman. "Time to start another week."

Norman smiled faintly as he drank his coffee. Maybe a little walk down memory lane isn't such a bad way to start a Monday. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5jb2wa/norman_takes_a_walk_down_memory_lane/] createDate=[1482234469] score=[72] numComments=[6]>

Norman the cat was sitting on the back rest of the couch on the far wall and moving his tail smoothly back and forth. Norman nodded and smiled gently in contentment.

Norman quickly became alarmed, however, as Norman the cat slid off the back of the couch and desperately hung on by his claws. Norman, not wanting his companion to suffer a fall, promptly rose from his seat and moved to save him from the pending accident. But before Norman could reach him, Norman the cat fell behind the couch and out of view. Norman's face filled with worry as he didn't want him to be hurt.

Norman decided to get down on the floor to check under the couch. As he peered under, Norman the cat emerged from the darkness below, rubbed his coat against Norman's right cheek, and gave a pleasant *purr*.

Norman sighed with relief.

</thread><thread title=[Norman gets a surprise visit.] author=[justsomewhitedude] text=[Norman just had a longer than usual day at work, so he decided to treat himself to some fast food. He pulled into a local burger joint. Not too popular but he remembers it was a good place. As he looked at the menu, a nice looking middle aged woman walked in. Since there was only one register, and he was still looking he decided to let her in front of him. As she walked past he gave her a smile, but she didn't give any response. "Maby she didn't see me" he thought. So he went back to the menu. 
He decided on a average burger. Small fries and drink. He approached the front register and ordered his meal. "It will be $5.16" said the worker. He only had a $5 bill. He asked if they can spare some change... "no I'm sorry" said the worker. But it did not bother him. He just pulled out his card and swiped it. "What's the fee worth anyway" he thought.
 He got his number and took a seat. As he waited he noticed jr walking in. He got a sudden bump of joy. Jr was with a friend. So Norman walked over. Said hi, and offered to buy his meal. They ordered and talked for a second. Small talk. But it made Norman happy. When jr got his meal Norman realized it was to-go. He asked if he wanted to sit and eat with him. But jr said him and his friend had somewhere to go. He understood. His son is a busy kid. He said goodbye and told jr he loved him. Jr said "I'll catch you later"  Norman didn't mind he didn't say it back. He probably didn't want to say it in front of his friend. Norman cleaned up his table and went home. It wasn't much. But it was nice to see him on his birthday

* The word is 'maybe' - just a typo likely, I probably shouldn't have mentioned it

*He and his friend - "he had somewhere to go" is the same grammar as "he and his friend had somewhere to go". You drop 'and his friend' when you need to know what word to use. You don't say "him had somewhere to go" therefore you don't say "him and his friend had somewhere to go".

*An average burger - 'An' is used when a vowel sounds follows 'A'. 'Average' has a vowel sound.

Also that old martial artist guy is following a lineage as you say, Saitama bumbled along by himself with nothing taught to him.

___

Norman was momentarily confused by the sound of knocking at his door. Living in unit 603 of a tall apartment building Norman almost never had people knocking on his door outside of election season, which saw Norman awkwardly accepting literature from canvassers before closing his door and immediately tossing the proffered papers in the bin. There wasn't an election coming that Norman forgot, was there?

Indeed, there was not. Peering through the peephole in his door, Norman saw the elderly Gladys on the other side. A frail, gentle, and spritely old soul who tended to the flowers outside the apartment building, Gladys and her tiny poodle Wiltshire were among the only names Norman could put to faces in the whole building.

"Why, hello Gladys!" Norman wasn't sure yet if he was actually happy to see her or not, but it would be rude to not at least feign some kind of enjoyment for the visit. Wiltshire sat perfectly still in Gladys' wrinkled arms, her tight curly coat matching Gladys' perm to a tee. "What can I do for you?"

"Do you know how to play Euchre, sonny?" Gladys asked with a voice that sounded like a thin breeze through ancient papyrus. Norman did dimly recall the rules of the card game from his undergraduate days but hadn't played in years. "My partner is out of town today and I always go to the Euchre night at the community center on Saturdays. But I don't have a partner for tonight! Mind taking an old girl out on the town?"

Norman simply couldn't say no, but he knew that he was no match for the wizened greybeards and bluehairs at the community center. Would they mock him for his poor play? Would Gladys be upset if he didn't agree to take her? Words from Norman's father echoed in his mind - "humor the elderly - they know things you don't". And how brave Gladys was to ask such a thing! Norman just couldn't say no.

"Su-sure, Gladys! That sounds like fun. I'm a bit rusty though."

"Glad to hear it, sprout!" Gladys' eyes wore a rheumy twinkle while fingers stained brown with years of digging in dirt ran through Wiltshire's fur. "If you're not up to anything why don't you come meet my daughter Carol and have a cup of tea at my place? She and her friend are visiting before a concert in town tonight and we can have a few trial hands of cards. Just to clear up the rust, as it were."

As he walked to Gladys' unit it dawned on Norman that he had never seen the inside of another apartment in the building in the years he lived here.

He believed that it was very important to keep his cube neat and tidy. “A cluttered desk is a sign of a cluttered mind” he thought to himself, giving a half smile as he busily sharpened his pencils, careful to hold the sharpener directly over the trashcan. He didn’t want to make extra work for the cleaning staff by leaving pencil shavings all over the ground. 

Norman went to place the pencils back where they belonged, in his CSI mug that he bought specifically for them, but he hesitated. 

“If I put them point down then they might break on the bottom of the mug, but if I put them point up then someone could get hurt," he thought.

Norman contemplated his dilemma for a moment before gently placing the pencils point down into the mug, “it’s better not to risk it,” Norman thought, “I can always sharpen them again if I need to.”] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4errht/norman_gets_organized/] createDate=[1460677827] score=[70] numComments=[3]>

(He limited himself several weeks earlier after he caught himself not only carelessly wasting three hours of his day browsing the internet, looking at custom bowties to spice up his work outfits, but also missing the opening scene of CSI, which he still hasn't forgiven himself for.)

Norman was browsing through a news website when he came across the news of the new royal baby.  Norman smiled at the thought of the new life being brought into the world.  He scrolled down to see the comments and came across one that made him smile a second time:

"We are ALL British on this blessed day."

Norman looked outside at the changing leaves as Autumn began to set in.  He *did* feel British that day.  He shut down his computer, having reached his two hour limit, and went into the kitchen to make authentic English tea while humming "God save the queen" softly to himself.

</thread><thread title=[Norman receives a wedding invitation] author=[DwelveDeeper] text=[Norman's coworker Jack was getting married this weekend and had invited the entire office to the event. Norman was looking forward to it, Jack was a pleasant guy, plus he knew that Lisa was going to be there- not that it mattered of course, thought Norman. 

Norman had promptly sent out his RSVP the day he received the wedding invitation, (choosing the option, "Attending, no guest") he felt proud when Jack informed him a few days later that he was the first to RSVP! 

And now the wedding was this weekend, a week before Norman had gone into Macy's during their "One Day Only" sale and had gotten a great deal on a gray suit. Norman didn't want to boast but he really did think it was a fine suit, and he felt awfully good in it. The only problem was that it was a bit too big for him, so had it tailored. 

Today was the day it was ready to be picked up and he couldn't wait. Usually Norman spends a little extra time at the office, but promptly at 4:30, he packed up his things just like everyone else. On his way out, he ran into Lisa.

"You're heading out a bit early Norman! Have plans?"

"Just picking up my suit for Jack's wedding," said Norman, blushing a little.

"Oh nice, I'm sure you'll be looking very handsome! Well, see you this weekend!"

"You too- err- see you this weekend!" Norman stuttered. 

Lisa gave him a warm smile and headed to the elevator, Norman took the stairs, thinking he could use the exercise anyway.

...............

Norman looked at himself in the mirror of the dressing room. The tailor had made it too tight. He could barely button the top button, and it felt like the side inseams would rip if he moved his arms around too much. Not only that but the pants were too short, he thought it looked awfully silly, showing off so much of his socks.

"How does it fit?" the tailor asked outside the dressing room.

"Perfect," Norman replied.

He undressed, paid the tailor and drove home, knowing he had an old brown, backup suit he could wear to the wedding instead. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4sin7u/norman_receives_a_wedding_invitation/] createDate=[1468377893] score=[70] numComments=[9]>

"What are you doing?" asked Norman

"Oh. Waiting for the wife to pick me up," said the security guard while clicking with reckless abandon.

Norman noticed the way he played... he wasn't flagging any mines... *he isn't flagging any mines!!!* **Aaaagh!**

"You... you know you have t-to use right-click to flag them, right?" asked Norman nervously.

"Nah!" said the guard; "that's just gonna affect your best time, man!"

"But... what if you click on a mine by mistake? You gotta be safe!", insisted Norman.

"It's not gonna make it any safer if I put a flag on the wrong square, isn't it? I'd rather make one mistake than making two, while thinking that I was right the first time!" said the security guard.

Norman just took a turn and left the building; it's no use to fight an uphill battle. He was almost late for the movies, where he ordered some popcorn.

He sat at the theater, middle row middle to the screen, and grabbed some popcorn. It tasted sweet.

That would allow him a few minutes more of pleasurable sleep, but just a few, and not more, the day had to start and he had to be ready for it. He went to the place where he had prepared his clothes the night before. It was a special day, he was debuting new white sport socks. The clerk had told him that these new socks were not only appropriate for sports, but also for people working at offices, as the shape was ergonomically adapted to the foot. 

He was excited to try out the new socks, and right after he put them on he realized something particular. There was a "R" letter on his left foot, and a "L" letter in his right foot. That was obviously wrong, and Norman considered switching socks for a few seconds, but as he had snoozed his alarm before, he feared that he would be late for work. The socks felt comfortable just like that, so that would be his little secret for today.

As Norman was about to close the door of his apartment, he looked down one last time at his feet and couldn't help to grin at how wildly he was dressing today.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/56akfk/norman_dresses_wildly/] createDate=[1475861831] score=[70] numComments=[4]>

<comment number=[1]author=[rhowaldt]text=[I like the story, although at the same time I feel the lack of courage for something that could be so easy makes Norman a bit more "pathetic" than he seems to me. After all, he doesn't even have to ask the man to move aside - he could simply stand up, and communicate his desire to get out non-verbally.

As an alternative, I would think just the idea of being late for work would make him speak up, and he could then consider this act of assertiveness as a personal victory of sorts.

</thread><thread title=[Norman is Conflicted Between Magnets] author=[MattressCrane] text=[Norman stood in front of the fridge magnet section of a Hallmarks. He had a dilemma.

One magnet packet had images of cats and puns written on them. "I'm feline fine," one read, beside the face of a remarkably content cat. "I'm not lion!" 

Norman heaved a huff out of his nose in delight.

However the second package of cat pun magnets had different sayings on them. "You've got to be kitten meh!" one read. Norman didn't find this one nearly as clever, and slightly insultingly simple for the audience. No breath was huffed.

But this one claimed to have better magnet strength than the competitors. While Norman wanted the superior comedic magnets, he could not will himself to be so cheap. He couldn't help but feel attracted and repulsed by both of the magnet packets.

Norman decided to buy both. To his delight, he couldn't actually tell the difference in magnet strength between the brands.

</thread><thread title=[Norman contemplates spaghetti sauce.] author=[rillip] text=[It was grocery day again. Norman had gone to the new grocery store he had seen on his way to work earlier that day. It was called Norm's Green Grocer. Something about it had caught his attention. He'd spent all day waffling back and forth about whether to try it out or to stick to his usual routine. But in the end he reasoned that all grocery stores were the same so what could be the harm?


It was not the same. Norman's usual grocery store had wide aisles and the same florescent lighting as his work. This store had smaller more cramped aisles and mood lighting.

"It should've been called moody lighting," Norman thought to himself, chuckling at his own wit. 

Norm's was different in other way's too. It had a large buffet like area with strange looking cooked dishes you could buy. Norman was intrigued by these but he had a list based on what he planned to eat just like every week, he had better stick to it. Otherwise all that planning would go to waste. 

Norman trundled about the store picking out items and placing them in his cart. As he did, he noticed that the selection here was different. Many brands were missing and there were many new brands he hadn't seen before. He tried his best to stick to familiar ones but when he got to the spaghetti sauce he couldn't find any of his usual brands.

"No matter. Spaghetti sauce can't be too different from one brand to the next." He thought as he scanned the rows of glass jars. "I'll just pick one labeled marinara."

As he searched his eyes crossed a slightly lighter colored sauce. The label read "margherita". It had an exotic looking Mediterranean villa set beside a sweeping shoreline on the label. Maybe he should try this instead?

Norman's mind began to drift. He envisioned Mediterranean fishing boats and exotic women. He could feel a warm breeze on his skin. He imagined that wherever this picture was meant to be the locals probably drank wine and danced. He thought about drinking wine and watching exotic olive-skinned women dancing in the sand.

"Excuse me. Sir, excuse me?"

Norman was startled out of his uncharacteristic reverie. He had been so caught up he hadn't noticed a young woman was trying to get some sauce. She had mouse brown hair, black glasses and was an average size. Norman found her quite attractive.

"I'm so sorry." Norman stammered blushing deeply and grabbing a random jar to shove in his cart.


...


Later, on spaghetti night he would notice that it was the margherita he had grabbed. 

"This sauce is a bit too risque for me." Norman thought. "Guess it's buttered noodles tonight instead." 

And so it was. But instead of throwing the jar away he left it in the cupboard. Maybe Norman Jr. would take it home when he came to visit. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5qkl7b/norman_contemplates_spaghetti_sauce/] createDate=[1485589481] score=[66] numComments=[5]>

"No, no," Norman said to the cat as he set the bowl of food in front of Norma, "this isn't for you."

Norma stared at the food and back at Norman before she sighed and turned away from it. A little concerned, Norman tried everything he could to get her to eat. He even picked up some of the wet food and held it to her nose. The dog sniffed a couple of times before it sighed again.

Norman Jr. went to the cupboard and opened it up. Inside was a jar  of margherita sauce his father had accidentally purchased. He picked it up and then he paused. Something was wrong.

Norman hadn't come into the kitchen to greet him. This struck Norman Jr. as entirely uncharacteristic of his father.

"Dad?" Norman Jr. called. "Is everything all right?"

"Yes everything is fine son," said Norman entering the room. "I've just been cleaning and I got distracted by this box of old things from your childhood."

Norman Jr. passed into the other room. There on a table was a box. Spread out beside the box was a plethora of old school work, and pictures he had done as a child, and photographs. He picked one of these up. 

"Look dad! It's that time you took me fishing! I thought that fish was so big! It looks tiny now!" Norman junior excitedly remarked.

"Well I figured there was no harm in letting you enjoy your catch." admitted Norman with a chuckle.

There was a long moment of silence while the two reminisced and looked over the evidence of their shared past. This was broken by a loud honking from outside.

*Norman*: I'll pass, thanks.

*Nick*: Thank you, have a good one. 

*Norman*: Same to you. 

About half an hour later the pizza arrived.

<comment number=[1]author=[NegativeDevil]text=[It has been a regular day at work.

Norman leaves the building and makes his way toward the parking lot. As he reaches for the car door with his key, he happens to look up toward the sky and see his cat Norman flying among the clouds with large reptillian wings.

"Wow," Norman says. "That's pretty neat."

Norman then turns back to his car and sees that it is no longer his car, it is a rainbow stegosaurus, and his key is a knife that he obliviously stabbed the stegosaurus with.

The dinosaur, now angry, picks Norman up in his mouth, and Norman's last words before being swallowed by the beast were "I have now atoned for my sins."

However, upon being swallowed, he wakes up in bed.

"Wow," Norman says. "That was a neat dream."

</thread><thread title=[Norman Plays the Lottery] author=[MattressCrane] text=[Norman didn't actually play the lottery- instead, he would pretend he was, by recording his lucky numbers by himself, just to see if they happen to win. It was a hopeless hope he had.

For the past seven years, he's always chosen precisely the same numbers- 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13. He thought it was very cheeky to skip 12, for no particular reason. Unfortunately, these numbers have never won once in the past seven years- even if he wasn't winning anything to be begin with.

Today, however, Norman decided to have some change in his life. Instead of writing down the usual 7 to 13 minus 12, he decided to exclude 13- and finally include the lonely number. He wrote this down on a napkin, and again, for the 354th time, watched the numbers being called on the television.

*-today's winning numbers are... 7... 8...*

This was already fairing better than normal.

*9... 10... 11...*

Norman's heart was racing as if he'd just briskly jogged to work. He's never been this close before! Standing, palms sweating, and knees scrambling, Norman held his breath...

*... And the final number is... 12!*

Norman screamed in joy! All these years of trying 13, all these years of trying to be cheeky- all paid off- but it didn't matter now! Norman jumped up and down ecstatically in his apartment, happy with change, happy with joy in his life, happy to win!

Norman then remembered all he had was a napkin. 

*Well,* Norman thought, *at least there's proof.*

Norman placed the napkin inside his scrapbook full of photos and memories from decades earlier; the happy times. The napkin was right at home.

</thread><thread title=[Norman's awkward exchange] author=[bubbapwns] text=[Norman had just finished the sandwich he brought for lunch when the rest of his co-workers returned from the new burger place around the corner. One of his co-workers, Charlie, regularly brings his meal back to the office to finish, as he eats a bit slower than everyone else. He is a generous man and commonly offers to share his extra food with people around the office.

Today he walked back in eating a bag of chips and greeted Norman. Norman returns the greeting and Charlie asks something that Norman does not completely hear. 
"What was that?", Norman asks.
Charlie asks the same question but again Norman does not hear. Norman feels that it would be too awkward to ask Charlie to repeat himself a third time, so he assumes that he had offered some of his food to Norman, as he frequently does.
"No thank you", says Norman
Immediately a quizzical look strikes Charlie's face, and Norman realizes that his response was not appropriate for the question that was asked.
Charlie gives a low, hesitant "OK...", as he slowly drifts away from Norman's cubicle. Norman feels uncomfortable as he shifts in his chair and ponders on what the question could've been for the rest of the day.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5qf46a/normans_awkward_exchange/] createDate=[1485519343] score=[67] numComments=[5]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman's Breakfast] author=[Pop-Motion] text=[Norman is particularly thirsty this morning. He had forgotten to fill his bedside glass last night. Now his throat is uncomfortably itchy, and his tongue dry. He can't wait to fill his glass with clear, purified water from the kitchen tap once he gets downstairs.

Descending the stairs from his bedroom, and carefully stepping clear of Norman, Norman reconsiders his options.

*If I don't fill a glass, and just eat my cornflakes instead, the milk will cure my thirst and the cornflakes will be more invigorating as a result!*

Norman is shocked by his own idea. It's certainly a risk. What if the milk does not properly satisfy his needs, and his thirst just makes his breakfast unpleasant? Norman decides that he is feeling particularly adventurous today, and concludes that he will go ahead with eating just the cornflakes. Norman feels that it is healthy to take risks on occasion. Norman reaches the kitchen and opens the fridge, the door's contents jingling as it swings through the air. Norman looks for the milk, and is shocked. There is no milk. Norman is out of milk. He had finished it last night as he watched CSI on the television. Norman is very upset. How will he eat his cornflakes now? He feels a wave of guilt as he thinks of Norman, and how he will now be denied a saucer this morning. Norman makes a mental note to purchase a bottle from the local grocer as he returns from work, and eats his cornflakes dry.

He poured a big bowl of his favorite chips to eat as a snack for watching CSI. As he poured the final chip into his bowl, he saw the time and realized that he was already one minute late.

*"Oh no I've already missed the theme song"* Norman thought

Norman ran to the living room with his chips as fast as he could. He was never late. He could not miss anymore of the episode. As he ran he did not see Norman sleeping on the floor. He tripped over Norman, waking Norman up and spilling all the chips on the carpet.

*"Oh no a mess,"* Norman thought. *"I should not have been so careless, I'm going to have to clean it up"*

Norman cleaned up the mess and missed his favorite episode of CSI

*"Maybe next time I will see it,"* Norman thought before he went off to sleep.

___

Gladys' unit was filled with thick, beautiful foliage. Norman wondered how so many plants grew inside with only the one, albeit large, window. Outside, the balcony dripped with ruby-red cherry tomatoes. Leaves of plants unknown to Norman waved in the gentle breeze. The complex camphor of flowers and spices lingered even indoors.

"Cream in your tea, Norman? Or are you one of those heretics who ruin their tea with sugar?" Gladys had wasted no time in getting tea ready for her guests. Carol's rebuttal was half-embarrassed, half-teasing.

"Mom, I'm pretty sure calling people heretics is a few centuries outdated. And yes, I'm one of those heretics now." Gladys tut-tutted with her tongue. Even while joking Carol had a soothing voice.

"I take my tea black, thanks", said Amal.

"Whatever's easiest by you", said Norman. It would not do to be a nuisance.

Deftly dodging an assortment of leaves near the window, Gladys navigated the tea tray to her tiny coffee table. Gladys hadn't skimped on the cream for Norman but he could only barely start sipping the brew before the flapping of cards being shuffled rang through the apartment.

"Okay, kids! Time to play Euchre. My heretic daughter and Amal versus the people who know how tea *ought* to be served. Teas vult, Norman!"

Norman had no idea what that meant and he wasn't about to ask.

The cards were dealt. Gladys winked as she called trump; Norman had the left bower but nothing else to help her.

"Hey, Norman". Norman looked at Carol. Her fingernails seemed impossibly long. "You seem tensed up. Anything on your mind?"

There was plenty on Norman's mind. He still hadn't thought of a gift for Norm's Convocation. There was a tricky assignment at work that came right from the top waiting on Norman's work desk. And of course he couldn't let Gladys down tonight at the community center.

"Oh, you know...work and things." Norman was almost certain that Carol wouldn't buy his attempt at sounding confident. He burned the nine of hearts and Gladys took the trick. Amal played the trump Ace on the next trick. Here was Norman's chance! His left bower won the trick. Norman smiled - he hadn't had this much fun playing cards since undergrad.

"Speaking of work, what do you two do?"  Norman feared that his attempt at conversation was weak. If it was, nobody mentioned it. Amal was a traffic engineer; Carol was a therapist doing her Masters at Norman's alma mater and working on a clinical research study with her supervisor.

It's funny, Norman thought, the last time he played Euchre he was also with students from his alma mater. Maybe Norm learned how to play while he was there too.

The afternoon passed quickly in chatter and warmth, and soon it was time to part ways. Gladys told Wiltshire not to eat her tomatoes and Norman shuffled back to his unit to make sure Norman had food before the two started off for the community center.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4m6s2q/norman_wins_a_hand_of_euchre/] createDate=[1464897295] score=[66] numComments=[11]>

___

Julia was just ending a phone call to her executive assistant as she came through the front door of her house.

"I didn't start a business to babysit, dammit!" Beep.

High heels snapped on marble as Julia dialled her voicemail and walked to the kitchen.

"Hi, Mom. Called Da-uh, Norman today about the tickets. He seemed really hurt. I don't know why you even want Randy to come to Convocation. He doesn't exactly seem to care. Anyways, you should get the tickets today or tomorrow. I'll see you at Convocation."

Shit. Norm was upset. No "I love you" - not even a goodbye. Face pursed, she scoured the mail that Randy had crudely piled on the table and found the tickets. As her finger traced the crest of her alma mater on the envelope Julia fretted. Why was Norm so cold towards Randy? Randy was a part of their family. And besides, seeing Norman would be upsetting. He had never taken Norm skiing in the Alps, or on safari, or even to sports camp. Julia had worked her ass off to be able to afford the best for Norm, and Norman hadn't. Simple as that. Norman's feelings were less important than having the family together to celebrate Norm's Convocation. Right?

Julia tried to take her mind off of the matter by running over her mental checklist for Norm's surprise Convocation afterparty. His roommate Steve had suggested guests for the event. She had already organized the caterers. She read somewhere that scrapbooks were in, so she had hired some woman off Etsy to make the thing. Julia had been putting off digging through the albums to send scrapbook content to the Etsy woman. It wasn't like Randy would do it. Once again, Julia thought, I have to do everything.

At the sight of the dusty albums Julia felt a deep stab of guilt in her soul and remembered why she was putting it off.

If there was anything Julia regretted most about the divorce it was not telling Norman where the family photo albums went. Norman was adamant about photographing their young family - it was something between a vocation and a hobby. He wasn't bad at it either. There were pictures of baby Norm in a wagon, Norm with Julia's parents, Norm as a toddler in a bumblebee costume - all gold.

As she organized the future contents of the scrapbook into a parcel Julia ruminated. A part of Norman died when she said that the albums were lost. Nobody deserved that. How could she have lied like that? Julia was haunted by the memory - Norman's staggered sobbing, her closing their front door for the last time...

"Focus, Julia". She stomped her feelings down as she sorted the photos and prepped the parcel for mailing.

As she fitfully struggled to fall asleep that night Julia wondered how Norman took the news about Convocation. She really hoped Norm would like the scrapbook. She loved her son so very much.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4m10af/normans_old_photo_albums/] createDate=[1464813230] score=[66] numComments=[8]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman paints his room] author=[F_for_Maestro] text=[One day Norman noticed an interior design catalog on his door step. The magazine had his name on it, though he couldn't remember ordering anything from "flashy interiors monthly". He decided it was safe to take it since, after all, it did have his name on it. After thumbing through the pages for a few minuets Norman decided he would change the color of his bedroom. 

Norman goes to the paint store and Upon opening the door Norman was greeted by a spunky young woman. "good afternoon!" She said in an inviting tone. This overzealous greeting startled Norman as he was expecting a burley man to be working the paint store. Norman grinned awkwardly and made his way to the wall of colors without saying a word. 

As Norman gazed in awe at the seemingly infinite number of colors he felt a slight uneasiness. Anxiety began to creep in as he gazed upon the reds, blues and yellows spread out before him, he began to question everything he thought he new about color. There were colors here Norman had never imagined in his wildest dreams! It began to overwhelm him. Noticing Normans dilemma  the young woman asked if he wanted help picking a color for his room, he reluctantly accepted. After about 30 minuets, sweating and consumed with doubt Norman had reach an uneasy decision. Norman paid for his paint along with a brush which the woman helped him pick out and headed home. 

On the drive home Norman fantasized about his new bedroom color. And how making a change might be good for his fragile self esteem, Norman felt confident.

Later that night, covered in paint, and exhausted Norman surveys his work, "a fine color" Norman thinks to himself. After cleaning up Norman says goodnight to Norman and goes off to bed in his new slightly darker beige room. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/58k1nc/norman_paints_his_room/] createDate=[1477034012] score=[65] numComments=[6]>

<comment number=[3]author=[rhowaldt]text=[Good start for sure, well done!

While the writing is a bit messy in places, I am more concerned with the idea of a beige bedroom. I see how "beige" as a colour is considered "boring", and I could make some argument about how Norman isn't necessarily that, but I'd rather simply focus on beige as a colour for a bedroom in itself. How realistic is it? Don't get me wrong: The idea itself, of Norman having to choose a colour then returning with only a slight variety of it, is really good. But I know I've never seen a beige bedroom before, and I imagine it would look ugly. I have seen plenty of ugly bedrooms, but never a beige one. Always some ugly green or ugly yellow or some shit.

So I think the beige doesn't make sense, and replacing it with another colour (like "cream", which is a much more popular variety of wall paint) would have the added effect of taking away that cliche reference to boredom that is, all said and done, not really apt. 

Of course in the end this is your story, so please consider the above as a simple suggestion, which you can freely discard if you believe me to be wrong :)

Thanks for submitting your story to Norman's legacy!]score=[-4] </comment>
<comment number=[4]author=[F_for_Maestro]text=[I actually work in a paint store. Our most popular color is a color called "Kilim beige" it is the most beige. 

I sort of picture Norman as the kind of guy who has never painted. I imagine he moved into a house where the former owners painted the whole interior beige before they left. Which is very common. Apparently neutral color houses sell better. I think Norman would have moved in and never thought to paint until...a magazine arrives unexpectedly! 

I do need to work on my writing though, your right about that.

<comment number=[2]author=[raefsenpupta]text=[Foreword: This is what I want lifeofnorman to be about. From reading the stories and comments here, I think some people here may agree with me, but some definitely do not. On with the show.

About the junk mail in his mailbox, it's less concrete than what you are getting at. It's much more about denial in Norman. Norman knows it's not possible that he would have skipped over an email without reading it, but if he can't turn that impossibility into a slim possibility, what can he hold on to? What I think is the beauty about Norman is the way that he's constructed the same way as a very depressive character, but is toned down to the extreme so that the depressive behavior is minimized to the point of meaninglessness when compared to general behavior in the lives of the readers and others in the real world. One element (or symptom) of this depression is denial: how people create perceptions and events for themselves to hold on to in order to preserve something in their life. Norman does just this, and the thing he's preserving is the idea that he hasn't moved completely into blandness of character and feeling yet: that he has the ability to become a real and feeling person.

Norman creates all of these little things for himself (like leaving the junk mail in his mailbox) in order to let himself continue to pretend that he has this ability to become "real" and to escape the dullness of his current person. Most people have things in their lives that clearly give meaning to their life. If they ever ask the question "What is the point in my life?", they can come up with a reasonable answer based on these concrete things. Norman doesn't have these things. All he has is a series of events that have no meaning to his life whatsoever. Norman has only one choice possible to him, and that is to pretend subconsciously that these events do contain snippets of that meaning he is searching for that for him can never exist.]score=[4] </comment>

Like most mornings, Norman started it with his favorite breakfast- milk toast. It was a dish designed for those with sensitive stomachs, and as Norman was quite the sensitive man, condensed milk on toast was synonymous with blissful pleasure.

Like a swing and a miss attempt to stop a ringing alarm, Norman soon had to fully wake to realize he was having a difficult time finding the loaf of bread. He knew he didn't eat all of it yet, since he only purchased the loaf at 7 PM the day before, and went to sleep immediately after placing it on his kitchen counter. Or so he thought. 

After spending half of his alotted morning time searching for bread, Norman gave up. Defeated, Norman spent the third quarter of his alotted time working up the courage to eat cereal for breakfast.

After discovering he was also out of milk, Norman sulked for the final quarter of his morning. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/559jlh/normans_milk_toast/] createDate=[1475291707] score=[59] numComments=[8]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman is Still Irritated, Part two] author=[MattressCrane] text=[
Norman entered the café with a great deal of pessimism. He knew what he wanted to order- a dark roast coffee- but he also knew the chances of him getting that dark roast is unlikely. For the past few weeks, the barista has, without fail, given him the wrong brew- a medium roast coffee. Norman was fine with both, but on a matter of principle, he was tired of being given the wrong coffee when he clearly remembers ordering the dark roast. 

The barista looked just as defeated as Norman. She yawned as Norman approached the counter.

“Hi there.” said the barista. Her headphones were in neither ear, but hung over her shoulder like a dishrag.

“Good good, can I order a dark roast coffee?” Norman didn’t bother emphasizing dark roast today. He didn’t see the point.

“Dark roast coffee is 2.25, please.”

Norman didn’t know what to say. He stood there in shock, as his repetition and unwillingness to confront his problems paid off! He smiled as he walked away, proudly shoveling sugar into the cup.

Tomorrow, perhaps he will have a medium roast. After finishing the dark cup of coffee, he started to miss his routine of miscommunication.

This was not something that Norman was used to feeling, his usual self being quite forgiving of everything. He forgave the garbage man for missing his compost bin last week. He forgave the little boy in his apartment lobby for pointing out his bald spot. He forgave his ex-wife for leaving him for another man, and he forgave his DVD rental store clerk for being that other man. Norman was quite forgiving.

“Hello, how’s your day?” asked the barista. She had one headphone in her ear and the other dangling on her chest.

“Good good, can I order a medium *dark* roast coffee please?”

“Medium medium is 2.25, please.” Norman paid the fee. Norman was furious.

Did he ask for a medium coffee!? He was fairly certain he said dark- the same as every other day. This one barista however, always seemed to confuse the two and give Norman a medium roast coffee. Norman was completely content with medium, but it was about the principle! Norman’s face grew red with frustration as he stirred the three sugar packets and creamer into the mild cup of coffee. Norman was irritated.

Norman walked down every aisle and got his typical items: red apples, water bottles, granola bars, cat food, raisin cookie mix, and low fat milk. He strolled down into the third aisle where his favorite potato chips normally were. As he was looking for them, he saw his crush from high school Becka Wonderfield, and she was walking over!

*"Oh no"* Norman thought.

*"Norman from high school?"* Becka asked with a huge smile on her face.

*"Hi"* Norman said sheepishly.

*"Well I'll be a hoot and a hollering, how you been Norman?* Becka said.

*"Good"* Norman said as he blushed. "How about you?" he asked.

*"I've been doing great! I just moved back here again, and I just love it! I'm looking for some friends or people I can, just you know hang out with,"* Becka said.

*"Great!"* Norman said nervously. *"I uhh...gotta get home and feed Norman, but nice catching up with you"*. He quickly grabbed a bag of chips and headed for the checkout. He headed to the checkout and quickly paid and bagged up all of his items. He speed walked to the car, when he had a sudden realization that he bought the wrong chips.

*"I just have to get the right chips next time"* as Norman began his drive home.

</thread><thread title=[Norman Baits] author=[nana_had_a_fall] text=[Norman couldn't sleep. He had had his mug of warm cocoa and milk which usually made him instantly docile, but this evening something was agitating him. 

He lay in the dark listening to Norman's happy purrs, staring straight at the blank ceiling.

Maybe there was sugar in his cocoa, he wondered - it was after all a new brand of cocoa, and he hadn't read the packaging details like he usually did because he had been in a rush that day. 

He decided he must get to the bottom of it and go and see the label for himself. It would be the last time he ever bought *that* brand.

He put his robe and slippers on and made for the kitchen, being sure not to rouse Norman as he did so. 

On entering the kitchen and turning on the light, half a dozen or so little black critters scurried into hidey-holes. One went behind the tea canister, another slipped in between the crack of the cutlery draw. 

Norman shuddered. If there was one creature he disliked, it was the cockroach. 

He stood at the doorway, unsure how to proceed. He thought about throwing his slippers at the pantry to scare any away  that might be around the cocoa, but instead he decided he would simply have to wait this one out and get to the bottom of it in the morning. 


Norman had a miserable sleep. 


But the next day Norman was cheerful - he had been to the supermarket and bought his usual brand of cocoa which was completely sugar free, binning the other brand which indeed contained sugar. 

He had also bought a packet of four cockroach baits which looked ominous and impressive - like flying saucers made by Batman's engineers, he thought. 

He slipped one behind the refrigerator, one at the top shelf of the pantry, one on the window sill, and the other under the sink. 

The rest of the afternoon he spent scrubbing his kitchen from top to bottom. Norman sat in the doorway keeping company, washing himself from time to time. 

When the cleaning was done, Norman put away his gloves and smiled at Norman, "I don't set a fancy table, but my kitchen's awful homey," he chuckled.

A long time ago I bought a bundle of gold and have been slowly giving it away through writing contests here on the sub. So, rules are this: whoever writes the highest rated story following the theme wins gold. Also, I'll give out a second gold to my personal favorite of the week.

**This weeks rule is simple: have the story be in the comedy genre. Make it funny.** However you want to interpret that, just have it be a lighthearted one. There's no limit to how many stories you can write; you can very well win two gold if it works out right. 

Winners will be decided on next Thursday, the 23rd.

Norman blearily awoke to the droning cadence of the usual late night infomercial programming.He must have fell asleep watching *CSI* again.
Norman had always liked these, even if he never could quite stay awake (let alone coherent) during them. Still half asleep, he squinted across the dark and cluttered living room. Norman was curled up at the edge of his recliner, and through his still blurred vision he could just make out "2:24" in blue blocky numbers atop his bookshelf. 

*"--a great anniversary gift for that special someone, --"*

</thread><thread title=[Norman Gets A New Telephone] author=[SnoopTidder] text=[It was a dreary Tuesday afternoon and Norman was sat in his cubicle staring blankly at his designated telephone. 

He loved his trusty telephone; he had been using the very same phone since he joined the company, but it was beginning to show its age.

Norman heaved a sigh, half heartedly picking the receiver up before gently replacing it in its cradle. The telephone hook was broken so Norman wasn't able to hang up the phone at the end of a conversion. Needless to say, this particular malfunction has led to more than a few awkward drawn out goodbyes with prospective clients. 

Earlier that day Norman had met the IT guy 'Bob' on the stairs; Norman had decided with regret to have his old telephone replaced and Bob had assured him the replacement would be with him by the close of business.

So, Norman sat, anxiously, staring at his telephone and pondering what the replacement might be. 

At that moment, Bob had appeared and swiftly replaced Norman's telephone with a shiny new grey Cisco VOIP phone. 

Bob vanished out of sight and Norman was left to check his new telephone. It was a much newer model and had multiple different ringtones. Norman glanced around the office; it was suitably quiet, so Norman decided to test everyone from the marimba tone to the xylophone tone. 

After five minutes of aural discovery, Norman settled on the default tone, suitably named 'Default Chirp'. 

'That's how a telephone should sound.' Thought Norman as he packed up his things and prepared to leave the office.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4wwniu/norman_gets_a_new_telephone/] createDate=[1470784241] score=[55] numComments=[2]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Sees Someone Through the Crack of the Stall] author=[MattressCrane] text=[Norman began his lunch-break by taking a trip to the toilet. After stepping into the bathroom with a single stall and two urinals, Norman surreptitiously undid his pants and took a seat. Norman enjoyed his bathroom breaks; he was certain no one would ask him to file away some new T4 reports, nor ask him how his day was going. The social barrier of the stall door was the pearly gates that Norman had always dreamed of. 

A moment later, someone entered the bathroom. Norman held his breath. The footsteps sounded agitated- the other man wasn't interested in the urinals.

*He was interested in the toilet.*

Norman had hoped the man would see the locked door, leave the room, and check back in a minute, but no- the person paced back and forth, sighed, stood by the mirror, and waited, ever so patiently, for Norman to make a move. Norman couldn't do a thing under pressure like that. 

*Who would do this to me?!* Norman thought to himself in a panicked tone. He tried to peak under the stall to see the shoes of the other man. He knew that Andrew had recently purchased new orange sneakers, and was quite proud of wearing them, despite going against appropriate office attire. Norman bent down and saw the shoes- they weren't orange, as he'd hoped, but black, and scoffed. *Are those...*

Norman looked up to the crack between the stall door, and there, he made contact. Eye contact.

Quickly Norman's eyes flitted away, and the impatient man quickly left the bathroom. *It was Frank!*

Frank was Norman's cubicle mate. He should have known that the scoffed shoes were his! He saw them every single day!

Norman left the bathroom a moment later and returned to his cubicle. There, he saw Frank, quietly eating his sandwich over his keyboard. Black scoffed shoes leaned against the swivels on his chair. Neither man acknowledged each other.

Norman pulled out his own lunch, and began to eat, pretending that violating act had never taken place.. Maybe he should say something. It would spill into rumors eventually. Perhaps he should take hold of it while he can. Norman felt like the Monica Lewinsky of the office place.

Norman decided not to confront Frank- not today. He also felt too uncomfortable to eat his lunch beside him either. Norman carried his lunch into the bathroom and continued to finish eating it in the safety of the bathroom stall.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4qz8mz/norman_sees_someone_through_the_crack_of_the_stall/] createDate=[1467525539] score=[58] numComments=[4]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman takes a delivery.] author=[Dolferan] text=[Norman had returned from lunch to find a brown cardboard box on his desk. It was about the same width as his keyboard and the height of a lever-arch file. It was unmarked.    
&amp;nbsp;    
Norman hadn't ordered, nor did he anticipate receiving anything. Perhaps junk-mail was now being delivered in bulk. He bit his lip and carefully scissored open the seal.    
&amp;nbsp;    
He lifted the flaps to reveal that the box was filled with cassette tapes. These can't have been his. He couldn't remember lending any cassette tapes to anyone. In fact, he couldn't recall even liking this much music. 'The Human League', 'Ultravox', 'Dexys Midnight Runners'. The names all sounded familiar.   
&amp;nbsp;    
It would have been quite the treasure trove if Norman had actually liked 80s synth music.    
&amp;nbsp;    
Norman wasn't really sure about 80s synth music.    
&amp;nbsp;    
As he delved deeper into the discography he found a folded-over sheet of A4 paper. It was a crayon drawing. The crudeness with which it had been drawn suggested a child's hand. It depicted a man waving outside a house. The man was helpfully labelled Frank. And at the bottom the drawing was signed 'Amber'.    
&amp;nbsp;    
"Oh." Norman glanced over the his colleague's desk and squinted at his computer monitor. On the desktop was a file labelled 'Amber'.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Norman carefully resealed the box and placed it on Frank's chair. When Frank came back from his lunch a look of recognition played across his face when he saw the box. He picked it up, walked over to where the confidential waste was piling up and dropped it unceremoniously on top. He noticed Norman watching him as he did this.    
&amp;nbsp;    
"It's just 80s guff," Frank said "I never really listened to it."    
&amp;nbsp;    
Norman thought he should say something.

</thread><thread title=[Norman Does what Norman Does Best] author=[baween] text=[Norman was almost asleep when the front door clicked.

Better investigate. Norman slowly stretched out while staring at the bedroom door. On a tired dresser to Norman’s left sat two photos in identical frames and a daily pill organizer with one day remaining. The first photo was a black-and-white shot from a long time ago, and the other was of Norman sitting sphinx-like on the couch. All was normal here. Feet fell on plush beige carpet and Norman headed down the hall, dodging some socks that hadn’t made it to the laundry hamper. The apartment definitely had to be cleaned up a little. Even the two degrees hanging in the bedroom were lazily askew.

Norman turned the corner, passing the washroom and the washer/dryer while looking towards the closet at the end of the hall. Nothing seemed off here. Oddly quiet, perhaps. Norman turned to take a look at the front door. Nothing. Hmm. Ah, well. Suddenly, a pang of hunger. Time for a snack.

Norman started for the kitchen by walking through the living room. The drapes had been pulled closed and the sparsely-furnished room as a result sighed a tired, lifeless shade of blue. The old wood-panelled television lay dead against the wall, staring blankly at the once-luxurious brown couch that Norman had known and loved for so very long. An old handmade quilt limped across the arm of the couch and onto the floor, grazing the half-finished crossword that lay awkwardly sprawled over the other cushions. Norman stopped to scratch an itch before continuing.

Hooking through the dining room, past the cheap tablecloth flopping over a formica table as if resigned to a grave fate, Norman reached the kitchen. Norman sat a moment in there to enjoy some food and a quick drink. Sunlight creeped into the kitchen through the window in the next room. A crayon drawing of a house and a photo of Norm as a child clung to the fridge by way of a souvenir magnet from London. Norman had never been there. The clock, a tacky affair that looked like a black cat clicked its eternal temporal rhythm. Norman watched the counterweight swing for a few seconds before moving on.

The rich smell of old books and the gentle kiss of sunlight greeted Norman in the library. This was the warmest room in the house, handsomely housing a fastidiously-curated book collection. But today Norman had another reason for enjoying this room so much. A forgotten cup of tea and a flipped-over sci-fi novel sat together on the wooden endtable next to the chair. The table on the other side of the recliner held Norman’s record player. Milk crates full of records sat loyally underneath the table. The pillow usually tucked against the back of the big plush recliner had fallen over in the sun. It felt warm and soft on Norman’s fur, and the sunbeam nuzzled him to sleep as the two big speakers against the walls kept watch.

Life was good.

</thread><thread title=[Norman wants some toast.] author=[tonystone2001] text=[Norman woke up one fine morning, feeling content and refreshed after 8. hours of sleep. He makes his bed and then heads for the kitchen, ready for breakfast. 
Craving some toast, he opens his breadbox to reveal he is completely out of bread. Norman must have forgotten to purchase some while at the supermarket. 

No matter, the supermarket was just down the street, and a brisk early morning walk would be a nice change. Norman puts on his clothes and shoes and walks out of his apartment, telling Norman the Cat that he will be back in a few minutes. Norman purrs in understanding.

Norman walks through the supermarket door, appreciating as always the convenient automatic doors, but feeling nostalgic about holding doors open for people. Having these thoughts in his head, Norman proceeds to the Bakery section.

As Norman walks by the the display case, he looks hungrily at the various cakes, pies, and fruit tarts being displayed. However, Norman has self control and knows that he doesn't need any dessert today. Looking over at the fresh baked bread, Norman ponders what to purchase. Remembering that his doctor told him to try and eat more whole grains, Norman ignores his usual white bread and purchases a freshly baked loaf of Rye.

Norman purchases the bread and proceeds to walk home, already thinking about how great his Rye toast will taste. Norman hasn't had Rye bread since he was boy, and he feels giddy about the idea of reliving a small aspect of his childhood.

Norman walks into his apartment, greets Norman the Cat, and puts the two slices of bread into his toaster. As he prepares his coffee, he hears the tell tale ding and puts his now perfect slice of toast onto his plate. He lightly lathers one with jam and the other with a coating of butter. He pours some 1% milk into his coffee, takes a sip and proceeds to take a heart bite of his toast.

To Norman's horror, he realizes he had accidentally purchases Pumpernickel Bread! Norman normally isn't a big fan of Pumpernickel, but he can tolerate. As he eats the rest of it, Norman reminds himself to be more careful in the future.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5qw2wv/norman_wants_some_toast/] createDate=[1485752233] score=[61] numComments=[3]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman loses his remote.] author=[piifunk] text=[It was a quiet Friday, and Norman found himself hungry for a small snack, which he had doubts of because it was so late. He had just emerged from his bedroom, wearing an old tee shirt and flannel pants, and started working to the kitchen. He stepped on his linoleum floor, noticing the sound his slippers made on the floor.

"Hmm. I feel like I'm making a ruckus. What do you think, Norman?" Norman simply nuzzles his flannel pant leg, in hopes of a snack himself. "I'll turn on the tv, that should drown out the noise."

He quickly returned to the living room, turned on the tv and settled on a volume that wasn't too loud, and didn't bother changing the channel because he didn't want to caught up in whatever show was on.

He returned to the kitchen, grabbed a plate and pulled out some turkey, cheese, and grabbed the bread from the top of the fridge. He tore off a tiny piece of turkey, which was low sodium because he thought it would be better for him, and dropped it on the floor in front of Norman, who jumped with delight as he started to eat it. While Norman was preoccupied he put a few slices of turkey on a slice of bread, then a single slice of cheese, then the top slice of bread. He put everything back in the fridge, and walked, with his planted sandwich, to his favorite chair and pulled a tray table towards him.
He looked at the sandwich, his stomach growling slightly, and told himself that he was going to wait until he decided on what to watch. He reached on the coffee table for his remote, but his hand couldn't find it. He switched his gaze to the coffee table, thinking he moved it from it's spot but it wasn't anywhere in the table.
"That's odd," he said to Norman, who was licking his face trying to get every last flavor of turkey that remained. "Do you see it under the table?" Norman just looked up at him, and gave a very content 'mrow'. Norman stood up and looked on the other tables in the living room, none of which had the remote on it. He looked under the coffee table, and then under the chair. Nothing. He digs around in the sides and under the cushion of the chair, and he still couldn't find it.

"Oh goodness," he muttered.

He went over to the bookcase and looked on each shelf, hoping he left it there by mistake. But, unfortunately, it wasn't there. He scratched his head in confusion, checked his pockets, and walked back into the kitchen.
"They should have a bell on these things. I mean, come on, where could I have left it?" Norman walked to the fridge, and noticing it wasn't there he walked back to the living room where Norman had jumped up on the tray table and was sniffing around on his plate. "Norman, no! I already gave you some turkey. If you get down now, there's a good chance I'll give you another piece." As if listening, Norman jumped off the table and laid right next to the chair.

Norman sat down, pulled the tray table towards him, and with a sigh he bit into the sandwich. "At least the bread's soft."
He gazed up and started watching whatever was on tv. It was the end of a documentary on inmate life in prison. They went into detail on what food was available through commissary, and how inmates use food as money.
"Norman, can you believe you can buy all these things with just food?" Norman looked up just as Norman dropped another piece of turkey, and this time he pawed at it before eating it. Norman was on his last bite of the sandwich and before he got up to put the dish in the sink he pet Norman and said "Good thing we're not in prison, Norman. I don't think I'd know how to price food, for all I know I could've bought another Norman with that turkey."

Norman meowed at him, stretching. "Oh, Norman, you know I would never get another Norman. You're my favorite." Norman dropped the dish in the sink and noticed the remote was on top of the fridge, right next to the loaf of bread. "Oh, my. To think my biggest problem is losing my remote; I don't even think they'd let Norman into prison with me." He smiled, and walked back to the living room to find an episode of CSI to watch.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4mgxl9/norman_loses_his_remote/] createDate=[1465045802] score=[58] numComments=[2]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman finds a message in a bottle.] author=[iamanightmar3] text=[It was early on a sunny Sunday morning. Norman decided it would be a good day to take a stroll along the beach; it wouldn't be too busy at this time. With each step, the wet sand consumed his feet, grinding between his toes. The scent of the salty ocean swept up into his nostrils with each crashing wave, clearing his head as well as his sinuses. Norman had been worrying all week about the presentation on Monday, but today his mind felt fresh and liberated.

Suddenly, something hard collided with his toe. Norman looked down. The end of his toenail had cracked ever so slightly, but there in front of his feet was a glass bottle. He picked it up, pulled out the cork, and discovered a wet, rolled up piece of paper inside. He unravelled it, reading as best he could the smudged words. It read simply this:

To whom it may concern,
I am writing this letter because I am lonely. It is my fortieth birthday today, and I am celebrating by signing divorce papers. You don't know me, you don't even know what I look like, but I really believe I am a good person at heart. I have a lot to give. I just fell for the wrong man, who left me utterly lost and alone. I have no friends, no family. I just want someone to sweep me off my feet, someone to make me happy, someone to hold me at night. I just want... someone. Even if it's just a friend, or a shoulder to cry on. Maybe you're in a similar situation to me. Maybe we could help each other. Make each other happy again.

She provided details of her whereabouts. Apparently, she could be found sitting on a red bench at the top of a hill at a local park Norman knew well (he was connoisseur of walking routes after all) at precisely midday every Sunday. It was obvious nobody had come across this letter yet. If they had, and if they had intended to pay a visit to this mysterious woman, they'd have most likely kept the letter.

Norman placed it delicately inside the bottle, and squeezed the cork back in, carrying it along the beach. He approached a lifeguard, sat in his high chair.

"Excuse me," he said. "I found this on the beach just over there. Could you please tell me where I can dispose of it? I wouldn't want anyone to accidentally step on it and break it. It'd be awfully sharp. Someone could really hurt themselves."

The lifeguard pointed him in the direction of a bin. Norman disposed of the glass bottle, smiling with pride at the thought of his good deed. Besides, anyone could have found that letter: a murderer; a stalker; a rapist. Later that day, Norman sat in his recliner, watching the latest season of Grey's Anatomy. He fell asleep at 8:00pm, Norman purring on his lap, waking up briefly again at 9:00pm to write in his diary:

</thread><thread title=[Norman feels unusual] author=[RLRYER] text=[Norman felt unusual today. This was particularly strange for him, since most days he felt particularly normal and in fact somewhat prided himself on this personal characteristic. It wouldn’t do to be too prideful, but somewhat prideful seemed all right. 

Perhaps he had forgotten something? Norman looked down at his desk. His favorite pens were all in their usual places. His peanut butter and jelly sandwich was stowed neatly in the break room fridge. No, everything was in place.

Norman looked around his workplace. Lisa was there at her desk, typing away, eyes down, hair pulled back in a bun sort of shape. Norman wondered what her hairdresser was like. Norman always went to the same place to get his hair cut. Norman liked his hairdresser. She never asked him any questions.

No, the workplace was the same as it had been for every day the past twenty years. What was bothering him? Norman couldn’t quite place it. After all, a new episode of CSI was on tonight. This was supposed to be a Good Day. 

Norman gazed out the window absentmindedly, watching people walking back and forth on the city streets. The people look like ants from up here, mused Norman. Norman looked around his office again, the familiar office. For a brief moment, he felt out of place. Twenty years is certainly a long time. 

Suddenly, Norman stood up. A pen clattered to the floor. Norman did not pick the pen up. He began to walk very fast.
    


The toilet flushed, and Norman sighed with relief. Now he would be able to get back to work. As he made his way back to his desk, he noticed the pen that had dropped to the ground. Norman chided himself for being so careless, and carefully placed the pen back on his desk.

</thread><thread title=[Norman has a spiritual experience.] author=[Dr_Grouch] text=[Norman was just getting ready for breakfast when he heard a knock on the door, his vision still blurry, he pondered for a moment who could it be, it had been a long time since he and Norman Jr had spend time together, he smiled at the possibility of his son coming to visit on a Saturday morning, it wouldn't be till later that Norman came to realize he had made a big mistake.

"Good morning sir, how are you doing today?" said a man with a woman by his side, they were both on their 40's.

"Hello, I'm just fine, how are you?" said Norman, maybe it was the new neighbors coming to say hi, he thought, Norman also thought it would be good idea to give them a friendly welcome, he had bought some raspberry pie last night, so he invited them in.

Norman took notice of the rings on their fingers, he thought they looked like a nice couple, until the man spoke again.

"Have you heard the good news?" It was at that very moment Norman truly realized the gravity of his mistake, he swallowed uncomfortably as the man opened a book, it read "The Watchtower", this wasn't Norman's first experience with that kind of material.

The man proceeded to give Norman the good news with great excitement, to which Norman just nodded with an awkward smile on his face, as he nervously agreed with everything this man said, after all, Norman didn't want to sound rude.

When the man was finished talking, the couple agreed to come pay Norman a visit next Saturday to keep discussing things, Norman closed the door and exhaled a long deep breath, and then he felt it.

His heart started pounding faster as he rushed to the kitchen, wasn't he making some toast before all of this? he wondered, when he arrived, he saw 2 slices of bread sitting still in the toaster, Norman was relieved, he then took a sip of his cup of coffee, but it was cold, Norman felt disappointed, just like the fact that it wasn't his son coming to visit after all, he then made himself another cup of coffee, and grabbed a slice of raspberry pie.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4w1jrh/norman_has_a_spiritual_experience/] createDate=[1470295523] score=[59] numComments=[5]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Visits the Two Special Women in His Life] author=[russelcrowe] text=[Norman slid on his brown winter boots and put on his coat, scarf, and old worn baseball cap. He grabbed his carefully prepared lunch and, in a flash, he was out the door into the bitter Chicago winter. It was the third Sunday of the month, the day Norman always visited Jane and Janey. Norman waddled through the deep snow and into his maroon Chevy Impala. He sat there momentarily in the driver's seat, staring at the empty passenger seat. His second wife Susan had always insisted upon going along to see Norman's first wife and daughter but she and Norman hadn't spoken since the finalization of their divorce a few weeks prior. It felt odd to him that he'd be going alone for the first time in a long while. Norman sighed, the air freezing into mist in the cold air. After a few moments he started up the engine and pulled out of his driveway. On his way Norman stopped to buy two elegant pink roses, just the kind Jane &amp; Janey like. Soon after he pulled into a large, snow packed parking lot. The walk always seemed to take forever, especially now that the snow had fallen, but Norman knew it well. It wasn't long before he was there. Row 64 plots 52 &amp; 53. Norman brushed the cold snow off of the bench across from the graves, sat down and, as always, read the stones.

</thread><thread title=[Norman gets involuntarily lectured on the bus] author=[pennypun] text=["Nah man, I'm terrific!", said the young man with a good portion of vitriol masquerading as sarcasm, and Norman immediately regretted asking him anything which might have been misconstrued as further aggravation from his side. The crowd of people in the bus Norman was sitting in was beginning to turn its attention towards Norman's seatmate, the air was suddenly filled with an explosive tension and Norman felt as if the powder keg this guy represented by himself could blow up any minute now. 

Prior to that confrontation, Norman had seated himself on his favorite spot, happy for a chance to recollect his thoughts, when this rather ... *chatty* fellow decided to vacate the seat right next to him and since then hadn't ceased to talk about his various dubious conspiracy theories, which involved a number of secret government agencies half of which Norman never had heard of before, the Freemasons and a circle of people the man chose to ominously refer to as 'the Elitists'. He was also coughing a lot, so when Norman innocently asked him if 'he was fine' after a particularly lung-rupturing coughing fit five minutes into his monologue, he just was looking for a chance to prove to this guy that after all his talk about the clandestine actions of these evil people, there were still some caring, decent people (like Norman) around.

"I'm fine! Don't look at me like I'm friggin' dying here, pal!", he spat back rudely. By chance and only for a few seconds, the two men locked eyes with each other. With a silent voice Norman retorted: "I was just like you one day, filled with anger, and frustration. And when I met my wife everything changed, the fire in me grew dim and I was ready to settle down ..." He paused, the memory was still fresh in his mind and out of all the people he was going to recount it to a total stranger on the bus; but if one could act uncouthly out in public without being hushed down for it, then why not join company?

"So anyways", he continued in the typical tone of his voice with an ever-so slightly tremor at its edges only close friends would even have noticed, "we agreed to a divorce some years ago and yesterday my son was paying me a visit, for the second, no, third time this year - the boy is now almost your age, too. Like you, he feels exploited by the system, he's going to college, works two jobs on the side and still has already accumulated so much debt that it'll cost him a good number of years to repay it all. You know what he told me when I asked him if I could do anything to make him feel better? 

'It's too late now to ask for a vasectomy, Dad! I s'pose you shouldn't have had me in the first place if you can't even sustain a marriage, for crying out loud!' ... God, I felt like such a failure." Despite all the loud voices of the passengers around them who had resumed with their own chit-chat and electronic distractions, almost drowning out these last words at the end, the man stared at Norman speechless, his unshaven, hollow-cheeked face expressing incredulity. "Wh-why are you telling me all this shit?", and in a stark contrast to before, he was now always whispering.

"Because I feel sorry for him, and by extension, for you."] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5deeyk/norman_gets_involuntarily_lectured_on_the_bus/] createDate=[1479393369] score=[59] numComments=[5]>

But he realized that was a risky idea, if someone thought he was being snarky they might feel offended. "Better not do that" he mumbled to himself. "Huh?" Turns out a woman next to him heard him mumbling... uh oh...Norman gave the woman a shocked expression, his eyes growing even larger through his wide framed glasses. Norman had no idea what to say so the corners of his mouth slightly pointed upward as he tried to be nice. The woman uncomfortably walked away. "I tried to be nice but I always get these same looks from people" this time he thought in his head.

</thread><thread title=[Norman's bathroom light.] author=[consciousclone] text=[The last slice of brown bread was in crumbles. Norman put the bread on his plate, and buttered it. He drank his tea, and watched as Norman weaved in and out of the kitchen table legs. Washing up the dishes was his least favourite part of the evening, and often thought of buying a dishwasher, but he was never prudent enough to put aside the money, instead opting to buy CSI box-sets instead. And besides, there was only himself in the house. *Dishwashers are a family appliance*. He dropped his dishes into a sink of hot water and went to the toilet instead, in an effort to prolong the mildly annoying task. As Norman switched on the bathroom light, it began to flicker. Another broken bulb. He went into he bathroom and pulled a single candle from one of the drawers, lighting the wick with an old lighter that required more than one attempt to get the flint going. The wick sizzled and popped and the flame rose high, then gradually shrunk down to a cosy round orb that danced on top of the candle. 

The bathroom functioned with the anatomy of a live person at times, as when Norman flushed the toilet, it bellowed throughout the pipe-work of his house, causing a gust of back locked wind to rupture from the bathroom sink. It caused the flame on the candle to mildly ripple, reminding Norman that it was still aflame. As he was about to blow it out himself, he noticed the golden glow rubbing off the skin of his hand. It was a beautiful colour which was a great improvement over the dull, incandescent lighting that usually lit his bathroom. Norman backed up towards the bathroom door, admiring the glow it emitted and watched the walls pulsate. The bathroom was more than welcoming and it enjoyed the addition of the candle. And so too did Norman.

</thread><thread title=[Norman Goes Out For a Fancy Dinner] author=[ANonWittyNewbie] text=[ Norman realizes it is Friday and that it was a great time to go out to eat at a nice restaurant, seeing as how he worked hard all week. He decides to go to a fancy restaurant but not too fancy because he knows it wouldn’t be the smartest financial decision so he settles on an Italian restaurant in the city that is just barely under his weekly spending budget. After he feeds Norman for the night he spends all afternoon getting ready to go out. If he was going to this upper-class place he wanted to make sure he was going to be dressed accordingly. As he is getting close to being ready, he feels a bit nervous as the experience of going out on a fancy dinner by himself is a bit overwhelming. He gets in his car to head off to the restaurant. When the restaurant comes into sight his heart rate goes up a bit and palms get a bit sweaty. He tells himself he has earn this dining experience for his work at the office this week. He parks his car and walks into the Olive Garden. He is greeted with a female hostess who appears to be a bit tired and in her mid 30’s. Norman thought she was pretty

&gt;“How many in your party, sir?” She said.

&gt;“Oh no, I’m j-just here for a lasagna” Norman nervously answers.

She confirms the order and tells Norman to wait at the bar. Norman thinks he was going to be seated at a nice table with those soft napkins but convinces himself that this wasn’t bad. A few minutes pass and the hostess comes back with Norman’s dinner in a brown bag. He doesn’t want to cause a scene by telling her he intended to eat at the restaurant so he takes the bag and pays for his dinner. Norman gets home and is too tired from the whole experience so he puts the dinner in the fridge and goes to bed were Norman is already fast asleep.

</thread><thread title=[Norman Needs Stamps] author=[TheOwlAndTheFinch] text=[It was a brisk 62 degrees on the Tuesday that Norman had decided to replenish his stamp supply. He had been running low for quite a while, but had not yet completed the task, simply because there were so few occasions in which they were needed anymore. (This, Norman thought, was a shame.) 

Usually, he'd head off to the Post Office after enjoying his toast and feeding Norman, but today, Norman had a different idea. While he never fancied himself an eavesdropper, he couldn't help but overhear things occasionally- and, the previous week, he had overheard his coworker Lisa mentioning that she had seen some lovely novelty stamps online whilst browsing for some new hand lotion.

Norman felt a small thrill as his laptop whirred to life. What a strange thought! He no longer had to settle for the options his local Post Office stocked. The sky was the limit! Feline Norman stretched lazily, not seeming to grasp the exciting prospects ahead of Norman.

After clicking on a few wrong links (he had typed in "stamps" instead of "postage stamps", leading to some red herrings) he finally reached an online marketplace filled to the brim with different types of stamps.

As he scrolled through the page, his timid smile grew. Stamps with cats on them! Stamps with coffee cups! He even marveled at a colorful Kwanzaa stamp; although he did not celebrate the holiday, he appreciated the mastery of the art.

"What do you think I should get, Norman?" He asked the disinterested cat. The cat did not acknowledge Norman.

"I wonder if they have CSI stamps." He chuckled to himself. Norman, of course, would never actually *use* such a silly stamp, because it would seem odd to the receiver, but his mind delighted in showing off his interests in a small, impractical way.

As he scrolled back to the top of the page, intending to type "CSI" in the search bar, he noticed something alarming.

*Page 1 of 148*, declared the arrow in the top right corner.

148 pages of stamps? *That must be a mistake*, Norman thought with a hint of awe. *That is entirely too many stamps.*

Norman asked Norman for his opinion once more, but the cat offered nothing more than a tail-flick. 

Feeling suddenly overwhelmed, Norman slowly shut his laptop, and decided he would visit the Post Office on Thursday.

</thread><thread title=[Norman 'takes five'] author=[Spinetablet] text=[Norman sat by the glow of his computer screen, tapping away at his keyboard, filling in and filing invoices. 4:34pm. Almost another productive day down.

Norman finished up his latest invoice. He moved his mouse over the excel spreadsheet over to the "File" tab, and promptly down to "Save." 'Save your work and save your time' Norman thought to himself, chuckling. 'What a pithy and efficient dictum, I should write that one down in my word journal!"

Norman closed the spreadsheet, ready to move onto the next, but to his dismay the shared folder on his computer was empty. All the invoices had been sorted and filed ready for sending. He nervously peered down at his watch. 4:37pm. Still another 23 minutes of the working day left. Norman fractically clicked through all the folders on his desktop, hoping to find a misfiled, unfinished spreadsheet, but return with nothing. Norman took a second look at his watch. 4:38pm. Norman was starting to feel wary. He'd already used up a minute of company time by not working, how easily can one minute turn to five, or ten, or even fifteen!? Norman needed to take things into his own hands.

Norman walked down the hallway to his boss' office. Quickly, yet not too fast as he didn't want to cause a stir. Norman walked past Lisa's cubicle, as Lisa gave off a little wave to Norman. Norman knew it wasn't his allocated break time and knew socialising wasn't (or shouldn't be) permitted during work hours. A nod was all Norman could spare.

As Norman approached the open door to his boss' office, he knocked gently three times. The perfect and professional amount of times to knock. "Excuse me, sir." Norman quietly uttered into the room, "I've completed all the spreadsheets in my shared folder." The boss looked up from his monitor with a blank stare. "Uh, yeah, sure thing Norm, take a five while I email you over some more." the boss replied. Norman, bewildered to the "take five" order, wandered back to his desk.

Norman didn't like the thought of resting during his work time. Norman sat in front of his computer screen with his emails already loaded onto the screen to save time. Normans hands were cupped together, neatly laying in front of his keyboard. Norman's eye kept darting to the time in the bottom right-hand corner of his screen.

'One minute down, another four to go' Norman sighed to himself when suddenely Norman opened his eyes, waking up to the real world, still at home in his bed.

'Norman, I just had the wildest dream' Norman said to Norman, but before he forgot, Norman reached over to his bedside table, resting ontop was a book labled "Norman's Word Journal." Norman quickly yet neatly wrote in another entry.

OP is explaining his story. Norman can change as each story says he does because Norman is a part of EACH OF US. The part that we love or hate or want or need. Order. Simplicity. Innocence. Honesty.

Whether they should have happened or not, whether the story meshes with what we think Norman would do or not, doesn't matter to the writer. It is a representation of /u/Spinetablet 's Norman. Not our own.

Norman was halfway through his second read-through of the list when the person in front of him started raising her voice at the checkout lady.

Norman watched for a few more seconds before stepping in and asking the customer to calm down. The lady then angrily made her way out of the store and Norman comforted the checkout lady while he got all his groceries checked out.

"Excuse me?" Said the checkout lady.

"Oh, sorry," said Norman, coming back to reality.

Norman quickly stepped up to the belt and placed his groceries down. His imagination surely made that conflict go by quicker. Norman could see the rude lady walking out the door while he swiped his card.

On his walk home, Norman thought about the situation. He confirmed that he had made the right choice by avoiding involvement in the conflict.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5vtqxw/norman_gets_his_groceries/] createDate=[1487919191] score=[55] numComments=[4]>

</thread><thread title=[Normans text disaster.] author=[Dr_Grouch] text=[Norman had been texting with a new coworker for a few days now, her name was Mary, she was new at the office, Norman thought she was very nice, and he appreciated the fact she gave her desk a feminine touch with small gadgets.

Norman had to go on an errand that day, it was very hot outside and the air conditioner had been acting up at the office, so when he saw a soda machine he thought of her, Norman thought this could be his chance to impress her but he didnt want to seem to bold, so he sent her a text, he tried phrasing it in many different ways, but he didnt want it to sound too formal, or like he was showing to much, so he went with a more casual tone.

"Do you want some coke?" it said, he waited for an answer for a while, while growing nervous by the minute.

20 minutes had passed and nothing, Norman was sweating by both the extreme heat and nervousness, his anxiety got the better of him so he decided just to finish up his business and go back to the office, he didnt want to get in trouble with his boss either.

Something very strange happened the following days, Mary started acting very distant, and for some reason whenever Norman sent texts to her, it always said the message was not able to deliver, so he sent a complaint to his phone company to no avail.

One night, Norman was feeling lonely, and while he sat on the couch he decided to read their old texts, to reminisce the good times, and then it happened, Normans eyes opened wide, and he nearly felt he was having a stroke, he couldnt believe what he was reading, "Do you want some cock?" it read, Norman started breathing heavily as his whole face turned red, and he reached for a glass of water in hopes of stopping his panic attack, he stopped to relax, his face between his two hands, Norman had heard about autocorrect before but right now no matter how much he searched for an answer to this in his mind, he couldnt get to that conclusion.

The following day Norman got a coke and decided he was going to explain the entire thing to Mary, but he felt too embarrased to engage in a conversation with her, from that day forward the office became a very uncomfortable place for Norman, and he avoided eye contact with her at all times.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5ivy3m/normans_text_disaster/] createDate=[1482029711] score=[52] numComments=[8]>

Having filled his cart with the essentials, Norman nearly walked past the Halloween display on his way to the checkout line. The shelves were lined with bagged candy and some of the biggest pumpkins Norman had ever seen. 

Norman Jr. had always insisted on making Jack O’ Lanterns for Halloween. Although Norman had always dreaded cleaning up the mess of pumpkin goop and soggy newspaper, now the only thing he remembered was how giddy Norman Jr. had been when it was time to go trick or treating. 

Combing the shelves, it took Norman a minute to find what he was looking for. He bent down to the bottom shelf and selected a bag of caramel cubes, his favorite treat.

“Alright alright!” shouted the motivational speaker to the group of vacationing office workers. “Everyone can stop socializing now. Get back to your chairs, I have something to say.” 

Norman didn’t have to move back to his seat, since he stayed put in his chair the entire time. Norman spent the last hour speaking to only one person, the woman sharing the seat beside him, named Claire. Over the last hour, the two learned many things about the other- Norman shared stories of his cat, Norman, and stories of antics that happen at the office. However, Norman also came out of his shell, if only a little. He told stories he hasn’t told anyone in decades, stories from high school and college. He also briefly told Claire about his divorce from his wife, from nearly a decade ago.

Claire also shared stories of her own. She talked of what it’s like working as a receptionist, and of a cat she had when she was a young girl. She also talked about herself, and her own divorce that was served only a year ago. Their conversation didn’t go any further, as Kurt Dupont had an announcement. 

“Now, did anyone learn anything new? Did anyone make any friends? If not, that’s too bad. But there’s always time to do something new. Now, this is the end of me talking directly to you guys. Tomorrow, we have some fun games planned around the island. Be sure to attend bright and early tomorrow morning in the lobby.”

Norman proceeded to leave the auditorium. He struggled at first, as the crowd was thick and many of the other people were also heading directly back to their hotel rooms above. He felt a tug on the back of his shirt. It was Claire.

“Hi Norman. Um… what are you up to right now?” she asked. In truth, Norman’s plans for the evening was to head back to his hotel room, take a nap, wake up in time for a new episode of CSI that was playing at seven, and then head back to sleep.

“Nothing much.” Norman responded.

“I don’t know if you would be interested in joining me for a lunch slash dinner, would you?”

Norman gulped, Norman shivered, and most importantly, Norman agreed. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4ig4hl/the_seminar_endsnorman_goes_on_vacation_part_7/] createDate=[1462767017] score=[54] numComments=[7]>

Norman paused for a moment, gazing at the clock. 10:13 and he had not yet finished drafting his email; Norman had no time for this unexpected demand.  Suddenly, the pragmatic in Norman spoke out: “She’ll have to get in there at some point I suppose” he grumbled.

*”Yes, thank-you.”* Norman paused before sending, then added *“Please ensure Norman does not escape through the front door when you come in”* and pressed send. Feeling encouraged by his ability to respond to such feverish demands in a timely manner, Norman continued his drafting of the email to his supervisor. Norman recalled it was against company policy to communicate via text message during work hours, and decided to forgo his 10:30 coffee break, just in case someone noticed his indiscretion.

Eager to inspect his domicile, Norman left work at 5pm sharp. Upon arrival Norman immediately inspected the new smoke detector; its stark white colour contrasted against the dull ceiling paint. He was quick to identify a bright green light that he assumed would emanate at all hours. On the counter Norman noticed a [jar of grape jam]( https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5fe985/norman_gets_earthconscious/?ref=search_posts) of the same brand as the one he had dropped on the sidewalk 2 days earlier on the way home from the supermarket.

“How dare she…” Norman said aloud, and promptly stored the jam in the back of his cabinet as not to remind himself of such a humiliating occurrence.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5fyv97/norman_receives_a_text_from_his_landlord/] createDate=[1480652173] score=[51] numComments=[6]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Runs Out of Cooler Water] author=[MattressCrane] text=[Norman's finger turned pale as he squeezed the lever on his water-cooler that was sitting comfortably in the corner of his kitchen. *All dried up*, Norman thought.

Norman enjoyed owning a water cooler. With it, his water was always cold, and it didn't have that metallic tang that tap water had- it was almost as if his sink was laced with dirty pennies he's dropped in there over the years. It was most likely true. Norman sighed.

Only drips came from the cooler, and the drips only formed a tiny puddle in his mug. He made a note to look into who this "Britta" person was and what she could do to fix his faucet, as well as writing down to purchase another jug when he went to the store. As much as he liked the jugged water, he felt terribly wasteful throwing away a giant plastic jug every week. 

One time he attempted to make use of an old jug, and started to use it to collect coins. He saw on a television show that someone collected enough coins over the span of eight years that they bought a new Civic. Norman tried it, for a little while, but became desperate to find a tip for a pizza man one lazy Saturday. He couldn't reach for the pennies at the bottom, so he shook it over the sink to get access. Now he has pipes full of pennies. Norman sighed once again.

He savored the few unfiltered(by pennies) drips of water in his cup, before refilling it anew from the sink.

The sink sputtered and moaned, shooting out the water. Norman let it run for a minute to get cold.

After a few minutes, Norman settled for lukewarm and prepared himself to drink the water.

Norman swished the cup, examining the water for blemishes.

*It can't be that bad,* Norman persuaded to himself.

He put his *[World's Greatest Liar](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/2qlkoq/norman_buys_an_heirloom/)* mug to his lips.

Norman later made a note to pick up three jugs of water from the store, and inquired into finding Britta's phone number. The fact that the salesperson on the telephone was a man relieved Norman, but he was also slightly disappointed his couldn't pretend she was a young, pretty blonde.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4nj72s/norman_runs_out_of_cooler_water/] createDate=[1465632418] score=[52] numComments=[5]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman gets in the Christmas spirit] author=[lordperiwinkle] text=[Norman sighed heavily, the calendar read Dec. 9, 2016.  "Well, looks like we should do something about Christmas" he remarked to his cat.  The cat looked at him and wondered why his human made such odd noises.  

Norman stood indecisively for a few seconds then hustled to his closet, put on his jacket, straightened his tie, tucked his wallet into his pocket and set out, locking his front door behind him.  He strode with purpose towards the nearest strip mall.  Lately, he had become aware of Walmart's reputation and deciding, rather late, to be a bit more politically active decided to eschew shopping there.  He admitted to himself that Family Dollar was probably equally terrible when it came to exploiting workers, but one had to start somewhere.  

He entered the store and reached for a hand basket.  Then feeling uncharacteristically bold he grabbed a bright red shopping cart instead.  He began his shopping at one side of the store, stashing items in his cart as he went.  Store brand of aleve, cheap shampoo, a new pack of combs.  Finally he was in the aisles that held the holiday decorations.  He wondered about getting an artificial tree, but knew he wanted a real one instead.  He had really not been in the mood for Christmas for the past several years, but he had to get out of his funk!  Sometimes, Norman thought, one has to at least go through the motions.  He chose a green wreath decked out with multi-colored balls, a cinnamon scented candle, a couple of strings of lights, two stockings, one green for himself and one peppermint striped for his cat.   He realized that stockings meant gifts.  Hmmm, thought Norman, what would Cat like?  What would I like?  Swiftly he walked to the pet aisle and grabbed several bags of kitty treats, a box of premium cat food, and a catnip mouse.  Feeling reckless he tossed in a ball with a bell and then put in a new cat dish, too.  Smiling, he walked to the food area.  Candy canes, chocolate kisses, shortbread cookies, all went into the cart.  He also bought two boxes of breakfast cereal, and then getting stern with himself, added a sensible box of old fashioned oatmeal.  "Boring old oatmeal" he muttered.  He hated plain oatmeal but knew it was good for him.  He added a bag of dried cranberries and some brown sugar to his cart; if he had to eat it plain it would just languish on his shelf.

Upon arriving home he hid all the cat gifts in the closet.  He hung up one set of lights on his porch, the other around the window inside where he and his cat could enjoy them.  He realized that he was almost happy.  He began to head outside with the wreath so he could hang it on his door but thought better of it.  instead, he hung it on the inside of his door.  If I put it outside he thought, I will hardly ever get to enjoy it.

He sat down, thinking hard.  Cat came and sat on his lap, purring loudly.  Gently, Norman scratched his cat's ears, the cat closed his eyes in pleasure.  "Cat", said Norman, "tomorrow I am going to go get us a real Christmas tree, and some decorations for it.  You have never seen a Christmas tree but I think you will like it.  I should only buy unbreakable ornaments, so it won't matter if you climb the tree."  Norman was quiet for a time, then said to his cat, "I am also going to get a couple of Christmas cards, I'm going to send one to my ex-wife, and also my son.  I wish I was closer to him."  Sadly Norman realized he had no idea what his son would enjoy getting for Christmas, but he had the bright idea to stick a $100 Amazon gift card in the envelope.  Feeling some better, Norman continued petting his cat until they both fell asleep in the chair.

</thread><thread title=[Norman tries a new music genre] author=[iwantsometea] text=[One monday Norman was in the middle of work. 

His next task was creating a presentation, which is for him an easy thing, so he decided he will listen to some music. 
(He normally don't listen to music so that he can focus, but a lot of people do, so he thought it's not against the rules.)


He opened up the Internet Explorer and typed "www.youtube.com".
Before he was going to search for music, he quickly skimmed the recommended videos and saw some rather strange things.

There were videos with strange titles. They were written with thin and wide spaced letters and chinese characters, and they looked they are music. ( "Artist - Song title")


Norman had a brilliant idea: it's time to try something new. He usually listens to Red Hot Chilli Peppers, but he dared to potentially waste his time for the unknown. 

He clicked on the link and a 30 minute long video welcomed him, displaying the head part of a statue. He checked the description and discovered that its a compilation of songs. 

*"Well, I dont have 30 minutes but I will listen to a few" - he thought.*


He started listening to the music. The title and the picture of the statue was strange enough, but the music surprised him even more: it sounded like elevator music.


He didn't understand why would anybody listen to this kind of music and why it had quite a low quality, but he didn't want to be reluctant to change, so he continouned to listen.


Minutes passed and Norman started daydreaming: He was with his dad in an elevator.

*"Busy man, always busy" - he mumbled silenty.*

He could go to work with his dad because it was a Take Your Kid To Work Day.

He once looked at the tall building from outside and was astonished by how big it is - and now he will see it from inside!


Even today he could clearly recall his feeling of excitement looking around in the complex, looking at the telephones, computers. It was a whole new world.

The greatest moment was when he looked outside behind the windows and saw the traffic. People and the cars looked tiny.

*It made Norman smile. "Good times, good times" - he giggled.*


He remembered school, the classes, the other kids whom he used to hang out with, the pranks they did - and Lisa, the girl from his class that he secretly fancied but were always too shy to ask out.


He was a kid. But time has passed, he went to college, got a job, and now he is a responsible, grown-up adult. Since then the twin towers collapsed, smartphones were invented, Facebook launched, he found Norman, and a lot of things has happened. 


As these events ran through his mind for a moment he wished he was young again. 

It's not that he was not content with his life now - he had a good job, a comfortable house, a reliable car and Norman, but he felt something, an emotion he felt long ago...


As Norman was deep in his thoughts, the speakers of his computer beeped - he've got mail. He felt guilty that he was daydreaming instead of work, and continouned with the presentation.

Norman had a very good time that evening watching the CSI reruns with his cat.

[Part three here](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4hebe5/norman_goes_on_vacation_part_3/)


As soon as Norman’s vacation started, it ended much the same. Today was the beginning of the mandatory retreats, the first one being entitled, “And You! And You! And You!”

Norman wasn’t excited for these retreats. He wanted nothing more than to just sit in his air conditioned room for the remainder of the trip. On top of air conditioning, the hotel also had free bottled water. Norman didn’t see the point in retreating from heaven.

Alas, Norman put on his best blue tie over his Hawaiian themed dress shirt, and tucked them into his khaki shorts. Down in the lobby of the hotel were dozens of other casually clothed office workers, none of them were wearing a blue tie and tie dye, fortunately, but they all were boasting a ring of flowers around the neck- ones that Norman didn’t already have. 

“Those of you with lei’s, please follow me here!” shouted a hotel worker, gesturing towards a large open hall of chairs. Norman started to feel nervous. *Am I only not wearing a necklace because I forgot? Or because I’m not supposed to be in there?* Norman hurried his way towards one of the workers. When Norman made eye contact, the words escaped out of his mouth, leaving him only pointing towards his neck, as if he was choking. The worker knew exactly what he meant.

“Here you go sir!” He hung a lei over Norman’s shoulders, and Norman let out a sigh of relief. His made his way into the full auditorium, and chose the first seat that he could see. The woman beside him gave him some nervous eye contact before quickly flitting back to the floor.
	
Norman read through the pamphlet four times before the curtains rose, and Kurt Dupont appeared.

</thread><thread title=[Norman and the broken cable box, Part 1.] author=[rubiksman333] text=[Norman arrived as usual, five minutes early to work. He parked his car and headed for the front door of the office. He shivered as a cold wind blew across the back of his neck.

"I wish I had known it would be so cold," thought Norman. "I would have worn a scarf."

Norman was happy that Spring time had come, although he wished the weather was more consistent from day to day. He normally watched the weather channel every morning before work, so that he could dress appropriately. However, Norman's cable box had stopped working a few days back. This annoyed Norman a great deal. Not only was he unprepared for the fluctuations in the weather, he was missing CSI as well! Not that it mattered much, Norman had already seen most of the episodes multiple times. Still, Norman hated to deviate from his regular schedule. 

During his lunch break, Norman thought to himself "Perhaps I should call my son. He's always been great with technology." Norman considered it, but eventually decided that he'd hate to be an inconvenience. 

That night, Norman went into his closet and got his favorite scarf, plain gray, and a light blue sweater. He put both in his car. 

"If the weather is cold, I'll be prepared," thought Norman. That night, Norman slept well, pleased that he had thought of such a clever solution.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4bcvjb/norman_and_the_broken_cable_box_part_1/] createDate=[1458605183] score=[53] numComments=[10]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Crosses the Bridge] author=[MattressCrane] text=[Norman was having an unfortunately poor day. A Monday, no less. That morning he showed up to work with a pile of paperwork waiting to greet him, and Rich Tucker, his boss, was also having an unfortunate day, resulting in a few snaps and jabs at Norman. Norman sighed as he took down the paperwork one page at a time, eager for the lunch break.

During the lunch break, Norman explored the possibilities of renting apartments in different cities. Chicago, Dallas, Springfield- all these places could be the answer to Norman's monotonous life. A change of scenery. His cat hated travelling, but perhaps it was necessary for Norman to feel good about where he was in life once again.

After work, Norman felt exhausted, but it was the first warm day of the season, and he decided to go for a walk. He wasn't quite sure where he was heading towards- at first, it was to find a Burger King, but Norman passed by a road he's never walked down before. In the distance was a sunset, and to Norman, it almost seemed as if it was speaking to him.

The road went on and on, until it stopped being a road, and more of a trail. Soon Norman started to realize where he was- a nature trail, leading into a nearby valley. He knew the valley well- the public bus Norman took everyday to work crossed a bridge that hung over the valley. However, in the 10 years that Norman lived in the city, he never once stepped foot in it, until today.

In the ravine, Norman was enamored by the tall trees; the deer wandering through the woods, and the families having afternoon pic-nics. He bumped into one particular family that reminded him of his own; a man, a woman, and a small boy. It didn't help that the little boy looked just like Junior. As Norman passed by the family, he noticed they were trying to take a group photo.

"Would you like some help with that?" Norman offered. They graciously accepted, and as if he were a ghost, Norman took a photo of the family, framing them along the river.

Norman continued his journey through the woods, taking a moment to stand by the mostly dried riverbed. In front of him were a flock of geese, huddling near the pillars of the bridge. A beaver dived into the water and swam into its dam. What Norman found most relaxing of all, was the wind- a long and groaning whistle came from the trees, and like an aftershock, the grass whistled too. The sounds of the city were gone.

As Norman headed home, he took a walk across the bridge that he was solely used to being driven across. A bench sat in the center, looking out at the river. It was calm, like glass. Norman spat off the edge, waiting one, two, three, four seconds before it splatted below him. For a moment, Norman thought of jumping.

 Normally, the reasoning against it was always selfless- if he died, who would look after his cat? What would Junior think? What kind of child might find his body? It would scar the child for life, and it would be his fault.

But this was different for him. It wasn't the thought of others that stopped Norman from jumping, but it was the moment itself. Norman wasn't afraid of heights, and he knew that the only way he would fall off the bridge is if he jumped. But in this moment, Norman didn't want to jump. He was enjoying himself, he was happy, and everything seemed to be okay. He was having too good of a time to end it all early.

Norman walked home, thinking about his day. The answer isn't that the city is boring, that it would all be fixed with a move to another city. The answer would be the same wherever he was- the little things; helping a family take a photo, skipping rocks on glass, the sound of the wind. He knew it wasn't the view that made him happy today; but his perspective.

Norman went to sleep without watching CSI this day. On his bedside table, Norman put down a flower that he picked earlier on the trail. It smelled good, it reminded him of the adventure he had. He knew it would die eventually. He would have to go pluck another soon.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4e710w/norman_crosses_the_bridge/] createDate=[1460343160] score=[46] numComments=[4]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman's Shared Birthday] author=[HansBrixOhNo] text=[Three cubicles to the water cooler of Norman housed Karen, a collector of various nicknacks, odds, and ends. While not to Norman's taste, he preferred a neat and tidy work area, he was fond of Karen's assortment of trinkets. Her 1959 World Fair Yo-Yo's and original "Operation" game were particularly intriguing to Norman. It was Karen's birthday, and Norman had been wrestling with weighty moral dilemma. 

A small crowd of coworkers had gathered around Karen's cubicle to present her with their gifts. It was a typical assortment of Target and chain restaurant gift cards. Karen, pleasant as always, was gracious. 

"Here you go, Karen", said Norman as he passed her his gift. Norman was unsure if she would enjoy the sentiment or disregard it as secondhand rubbish. 

"Thanks Dad, but you told me I was getting Mouse Ears and Ice Cream", Norman heard echoing in his mind. 

Karen opened the box and revealed a Disneyland Fiber-Optics Light Up Toy from 1988, the first year they had been featured at the Park. Karen flipped on the lights. Alive with new batteries, it still illuminated magnificently after all the years. Adorning the handle was an adhesive patch that read "Disneyland, 33 Magical Years".

Karen stood up, walked to Norman, and embraced him warmly. "Thank you Norman, I love it", she said, hugging him tightly. 

That night, as Norman indulged himself in his third Guinness Stout, he reclined in his chair and ran his fingers through Norman's coat. He felt a tad guilty having given away his son's toy. His guilt gave way to a wry smile. It had been sitting in his son's room for 28 years gathering dust. He doubted his son would even notice it missing. 

"Happy birthday", Norman said aloud as he drained the remainder of Guinness number three. "You only live once", he chuckled, as he stood to retrieve number four. It had been a good birthday. Norman was happy. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5jirbc/normans_shared_birthday/] createDate=[1482335984] score=[47] numComments=[4]>

<comment number=[4]author=[HansBrixOhNo]text=[Ha! Thanks for reading and commenting long after the post 🙂. I guess I was going for bittersweet? It's sad, but I feel like Norman would be happy to have his birthday slide by without spectacle (that's admittedly a personal touch - I love birthday celebrations - as long as they're not mine!)

More importantly, Norman realizes his son is something of a shit, so he decides to give the toy to someone appreciative. In my mind, this is a victory for Norman, and that makes him happy. 

I like it when Norman is happy with small triumphs and defiances, or is worried about unimportant things - I don't like it when people beat up on the guy 😕]score=[1] </comment>

</thread><thread title=[Norman learns about Zen] author=[CheckeredGemstone] text=[It was a pleasant evening and Norman sat outside, on his porch.     
He smiled and was generally pleased with the day. Being successful at work, breaking his record of push-ups, also touching his toes in the one yoga posture he felt had a good effect on his personality.      
People walked on the street and wished him a good evening, which he returned with a small nod and a belly-toned "Good evening." of his own creation.    

It was warm, but not hot. Orange and golden light reflected off of a skyscraper in the distance, bathing his visage in a mosaic of color. He felt very alive and content at the same time.

The loud music of a passing car made him frown instinctively. A middle-aged man with slightly better arms than him and a rather sophisticated dragon tattoo on his shoulder held his BMW at the opposite side of the street.

It was the boyfriend of his neighbor's daughter. The music ebbed off instantly, just when Norman had gotten used to it's rather loud and exciting verbal content.

He reduced his frown into a normal expression and gave the man a nod. It was answered.

Which was new and strange for Norman, but not entirely unlikely either.

He let parts of his life pass through his memory, in which he had noticed people like his neighbor's daughter's boyfriend and always felt a certain type of fear emerge from the situations revolving around them.
Something must have had changed.      

The younger athlete honked two times and a high pitched "Comming!" responded from the neighbors house. 

Norman had joined Norman on the porch and stretched happily in the sun.     

His life was more simple, hunt reflections then relax.    

Norman had a Deja Vú for a moment. Hadn't he seen Norman just like that before somewhere?

He stretched out his hand to the cat and pet it's belly. It responded with a look of unresolved disapproval and meowed in a distinctive "meOoorgh"-emphasis. The precise way that cats meow when they are not entirely happy about others' decisions.

Norman snickered and pulled his hand back. He was living quite dangerously.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4qsidh/norman_learns_about_zen/] createDate=[1467417990] score=[45] numComments=[2]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman's Cubicle Mate Frank (Norman and Frank Part 1/9)] author=[MattressCrane] text=[For eight hours a day, five days a week, Norman sat with his back facing towards an equally middle-aged man named Frank. Frank was slender, balder, and far more quiet than Norman- whose own hushed demeanor was something not to be underestimated. For the past nine years, the two men sat solemnly beside each other in the confines of their cubicle. In the morning they would say “Morning” to each other, and as they packed up their briefcases for the day, they would say “Evening”, even though both of them left the office at the same time, rode the elevator at the same time, and even wait at the bus stop at the same time. It didn’t help that they lived in the same apartment building, as well as the same floor.

Norman knew very little about Frank. Occasionally he would hear Frank discuss politics with Robert from sales, and from the amount of times Frank ordered in for lunch, Norman could tell he was a fan of Vietnamese food. Norman also knew that Frank had a wife named Josie, and an eight year old daughter named Amber. Norman felt that this was his one connection to Frank, if the two ever talked. Norman and his ex-wife divorced when Junior was only seven, and because of that, Norman was jealous of Frank. He was happy for him, but still, a part of Norman wished he were more like Frank.

The change of status quo occurred when Norman received a work-email on a Friday afternoon.

*“Hello everyone,*

*Just a reminder that today is Frank Jenkins's birthday! Please take a moment in your day to wish him Happy Birthday!”*

Norman hesitated. He quickly closed the email, just in case Frank saw it. It would spoil any surprise birthday parties, if anyone had happened to plan one for him. Norman then had to consider his options- say Happy Birthday to his face, and risk stumbling over his words, or write a carefully worded, but less thoughtful, email? 

“Hey Norman,” said Frank as he swung his chair around, “it’s my birthday.”

“Oh really? Happy-birday,” Norman slurred unconvincingly. He wished that Frank had said that to him in an email instead. 
	
“Since it’s Friday, I’m looking for someone to get drunk with tonight. I don’t normally ask you, but all I know is I’m not getting home until it’s real late. You in?”

Norman scoured his mind for an excuse, but as his head swiveled slowly in deep thought, Frank took it as a nod of agreement.
	
“Great. Let’s start at five.”

Norman began drinking water right away.

</thread><thread title=[Norman enjoys the movies.] author=[ReckoningGotham] text=[Norman bought the three large sodas, the three large popcorns, the tickets.  His son was here with his girlfriend.  He hadn't seen his son in months--Norman was taking his studies seriously and was well on his way to pursuing his dream.  Norman seemed different--bouncy, happy, a tad giggly, and Norman caught the two out of the corner of his eye hugging warmly and then teasing each other.  This made Norman feel warm--intensely so--before a small pang of sadness.  He decided to let it slide.

Norman had been planning this long weekend for two months now.  As soon as he'd heard that his son had a two week break and would split the time evenly with Norman, his mom, and her family, he couldn't contain himself.  He even found himself dropping small hints at work about a big movie night.  He had bought a waffle-maker two weeks ago.  When Norman was little, he always loved to sit on the counter and listen to his dad talk to him while making breakfast.  Now Norman got to share this again.

The movie Norman had chosen was light and airy, with no scary parts.  Halfway through, Anne, Norman's girlfriend had to take a call.  She left the theater. 

"How polite," Norman thought, and nudged his son on the shoulder approvingly.

Moments later Anne walked back into the room, her face shiny.  She leaned over to Norman and whispered something Norman couldn't hear. 

Norman was worried.  He stood them both up and walked them out of the theater.

Both were crying when he found them under the soft yellow light above them.

"Dad...Dad we have to go...Anne's father..."

Norman took over.  Norman called a cab, escorted them to the airport, bought snacks and stuffed them in their bags.  Norman waited with them and tried to find a way that they wouldn't need anything.

"They need each other now," thought Norman to himself, as his heart broke a little.

At 5AM, Norman and Anne hugged their last for the day.  Norman noticed that Anne squeezed tight.  

Norman didn't know what to say, so he held her close and said "Be safe and well, and I'm a phone call away." which made her sob harder.

Norman felt bad for saying it.

At 630, Norman arrived home to a waffle-maker that hadn't been used.

He went to bed.

</thread><thread title=[Norman visits the store] author=[LimitedDarjeeling] text=[Norman's cat, Norman, was kneading her paws up and down Norman's loafer.
Norman glanced at his watch. "Time for your evening milk"
Norman went to the fridge only to find that the milk had expired. 
"Back in a bit," he called to Norman, grabbing a windbreaker and walking out the door to the store.

Norman walked with a spring in his step to the local grocery store, enjoying the cool temperatures the evening had to offer.

When he reached the dairy section, he brought his hand to his face, looking for Norman's favorite brand of milk. He shuddered when he discovered stubble on his chin, realizing that he had missed a spot while shaving that morning. He told himself that he had to be more careful and thorough next morning for his shave, and continued to hold his hand over the stiff hairs on his face.

He took his left hand, opened the door to get Norman's favorite brand of milk, and headed to the register. 

While waiting to checkout, Norman noticed a lot of people had queued up behind him. He kept his dominant hand to his face, hiding his embarrassing five o' clock shadow. 

It took Norman twice as long to pay for his groceries and move through checkout without the use of his dominant hand. Norman placed his milk in a paper bag, and noticed a rather long line of shoppers behind him. Feeling guilty, he stayed at the very front of the line and helped each shopper bag their groceries. More and more people had stopped in the line because it had been moving quickly with him bagging (even with his left hand!). When the queue had shortened, he glanced at his watch. Three hours had passed. 

"Oh dear, I'd better get home to Norman for his milk." The cashier seemed disappointed that Norman was leaving, and he left for home remorseful.

When he got home, Norman was waiting patiently for her evening milk.

Norman opened the milk and realized that it was quite warm. He brought the milk to his nose and breathed deeply. It didn't smell spoiled.

"Better not take any chances," he said aloud as he poured the warm milk down the sink. 

Norman didn't sleep well that night.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5450vz/norman_visits_the_store/] createDate=[1474670546] score=[45] numComments=[0]>

He was in a clothes store and after much fruitless searching for a staircase up to the Men's section he submitted to the metallic chamber which promised to whisk him from women's underwear and right into the thick of men's hosiery.     
&amp;nbsp;    
Happily, he didn't need to wait long for the doors to slide open. The elevator was empty; he stepped in. As the tannoy announced that the doors were closing a hand shot through the gap and coaxed them open again.    
&amp;nbsp;    
It was Frank.       
&amp;nbsp;    
Norman worked with Frank. Their desks were joined. Sometimes important documents would fall through the gap between their desks and Norman wouldn't say anything. Frank would just grimace.

He had no idea whether Frank had recognised him.

"Special collection on loan from Museum of London - Chainmail and Armor!" Despite the dull pain in his left foot from all the standing and walking, Norman decided that this was not something he could easily pass up.


At the top of the stairs, and after catching his breath, Norman walked to the smiling clerk at the admission desk. Entrance to the special collection was an extra five dollars, but he justified the expense by the rarity of items promised by the poster. His admission came with a free headset tour, which the clerk assured him was most informative.


Norman stepped to the side, put on the earpiece, and clipped the player to his belt. He pressed play, and heard a woman's voice speaking. "Hola, y bienvenidos a la colección especial!" There had clearly been a mistake somewhere. He turned around and looked at the clerk, who was busy serving the next person in line. Norman couldn't stand to be a bother, and sighed before walking forward into the exhibit.

</thread><thread title=[Norman commits a faux pas] author=[President_Calhoun] text=[It was early in the evening, just after dinner, and Norman felt that a nice walk would be just what the doctor ordered.  Not that the doctor actually ordered it, mind you, but he felt it would be a fine thing anyway.

And it was.  It was cold, though not unpleasantly so, and the last rays of the sun glowed red above the western horizon.  "Red sky at night, sailors' delight," went the old saying.  Norman hoped it foretold a good tomorrow.

He walked a quarter-mile, then a quarter-mile more.  It felt good.  He breathed deeply, and the crisp evening air made him feel strong.  Yes, this walk was indeed a fine idea.  He would have to make it part of his daily regimen.

Just then Norman heard a car approaching from behind.  It slowed to a stop alongside him.  The driver rolled his window down.  He was a friendly-looking fellow about Norman's age, balding, with wire-rimmed glasses.  

"Need a lift?" asked the man.

"Oh, thank you," replied Norman.  "Thank you, but no.  I'm just out for the exercise."

"Capital idea!" said the driver.  He waved, pulling away.  "Have a good walk!"

"You too!" bleated Norman, waving back.

His arm froze in mid-wave.  He was sure, hearing the driver say, "Have a good," that he was going to end it with "evening," and had replied accordingly.  

Although it was winter, Norman's face felt hotter than an August sidewalk.  He considered sprinting after the car in the hope that he could explain things to the driver.  But the red taillights were already growing faint in the twilight.

With a sigh, Norman jammed his hands in his pockets and headed for home.  If he walked again, he would have to find a new route, lest he encounter the driver again.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5rc5nb/norman_commits_a_faux_pas/] createDate=[1485937228] score=[46] numComments=[0]>

</thread><thread title=[Penny "Creates" Norman] author=[kornerstrolley] text=[Penny was bored, and her long gunmetal gray nails clacked impatiently on the counter.  She learned a long time ago to stop counting the hours that, when disassembled, pooled into seemingly infinite minutes at the Shop-Qwik.


She envied her classmates; they were not forced to work nights and evenings at mid-tier groceries stores by their parents, but she was also knew the secret treasures this job held.  Penny was convinced she would write the next Great American Novel, and saw retail as a revolving door of characterization skills.

She invented backstories for every customer, an act she called "creation."  To Penny, all housewives were desperate, every teenager grappled with their identity, every child looked around with wonder.  Everyone could be interesting, Penny believed.  Everyone.  And she loved it most of all when her backstories appeared to be the truth.

Penny began assigning attributes to a shlubby looking middle aged man as he walked to her station.  He did not have a cart, only a hand basket filled with two bags of spinach, fat-free balsamic dressing, and three containers of cherry tomatoes, even though he had a five pound bag of cat food tucked under his left arm.

Penny's mind warped into overdrive.  Was the cat food a spontaneous purchase?  How could anyone forget their cat was almost out of food?  Was he cruel to his pets, too busy working at his office to even remember their food?  

Perhaps, she mused, he had read their flyer out front soliciting donations for the local animal shelter.  Yes, that would explain it.  She thought she had seen him looking at the flyer when he came in.

His personality reformed before her eyes.  Sure, he had a suspicious mustard yellow stain on his collar, but he was an optimistic do-gooder; he had no time for such things!  His cart was full of boring salad ingredients that did not appear to be his normal diet, given his hint of a double chin.  But he wasn't just another New Years Resolutioner; rather, he realized he needed to live so he could help others, transforming even his weight loss into a selfless act!

"I think you're doing a great thing," Penny said with a smile.

The man, in a soft, gentle voice, answered, "Umm...pardon?"

"Donating that cat food!  I know the shelter appreciates it.  I got my last cat from there, and I know they do great work.  I wish more people were like you."

"Umm...yes."  He trailed off, and smiled wanly at her, perhaps a bit pinker in the cheeks than before.

While she swiped his card, she wondered if he wasn't actually planning on donating the cat food after all, but despite his lukewarm response, she saw him drop the cat food in the donation bag.  Penny beamed.  She was always a great judge of character.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4q16yg/penny_creates_norman/] createDate=[1467025110] score=[45] numComments=[5]>

He was looking forward to drinking a cup of coffee he had made this morning and left in the break room. He didn't take the coffee with him to his desk because he didn't want to be too distracted from finishing his report. Once Norman typed the last few words on his report, he used the handy spell check feature to make sure there were no spelling errors. A green check mark appeared with the words, "You're good to go!" This made Norman smile, but he still read the report over again, just to be sure.

Once Norman felt confident enough to submit his report, he found it hard to contain his excitement of getting to finally drink his coffee. He almost grinned as he walked to the break room. Once Norman saw the coffee machine, he looked for his cup that he placed at the edge of the counter. Not too close to the edge though, he didn't want someone to accidentally bump into it. Norman didn't see it. He heard a laugh and looked across the room at Jim having a conversation with Lisa. Jim was holding Norman's cup. Norman knew it was his cup because his cup was the only one in the office that had nothing written on the side of it. Jim took a sip from the cup. Norman was surprised, but he knew just what to do in this situation. He rushed back to his desk as fast as he could walk and opened the bottom drawer of it. He took out a small box and went back to the break room. Norman placed the box on the counter, opened the box, took out a blank, white cup, washed it out in the sink, and made another cup of coffee.

He had seen it before, sometimes on the TV, others in print on postcards and t-shirts, and while they were still together, his ex-wife owned a printing of the painting. It hung in their bathroom, across from the toilet.

Norman pondered whether the metal canisters held coffee, tea, or milk. He figured milk would be a strange thing to kept in a place made to trap heat, but milk goes with coffee, or tea, and it made more sense to him that at least one of them were dedicated to accessories to a beverage.

<comment number=[1]author=[Abras]text=[The last sentence really brought this all together! When Norman's actually in front of the painting, his thoughts about it are pretty mundane and bland. But the last sentence reminds me of the ending of "50 First Dates," when Adam Sandler visits Drew Barrymore in "the home" and discovers that she's been painting picture after picture of him, even though her disorder means she has ostensibly forgotten about him. Your last sentence makes me think that the painting -- and something of the deep pull that makes it popular -- resonates with Norman on a subconscious level.]score=[5] </comment>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Nearly Joins a Cult] author=[ajsapi] text=[The phone rang and it wasn't mother. Norman held the phone to his mouth and introduced himself. "Um, I um, I..."

"Hello?" asked the caller on the other end of the line.

"Hello my name is Norman!" Norman managed.

"Hello Norman, my name's Porsis. And I was wondering if you could use a friend." The voice had a softness. It was husky, but held an alluring charm. Norman couldn't tell if it was male or female, but that wasn't out of the ordinary.

"Sure," Norman ventured. Of course he wanted a friend. But he remained skeptical. "*Who* is this?"

"My name's Porsis. And I'm a Friend For All Days." Now Norman knew why he got the call. Friends For All Days (formerly Friends For All Ages, before the most recent scandal) was a local group that Norman often encountered on his jaunts through the park. He once saw one of the members kiss a tree and it made him very uncomfortable. 

He stared into the mirror and imagined what it would look like if he was wearing three sweaters.

"Well Norman, would you like to be my friend? We have lots of activities. Hiking. Karaoke nights. All sorts of fun group outings." None of this interested him. "Why don't you just come by and we can discuss it over coffee?"

Norman perked up. "One cream. Three sugars," he said with a chuckle.

"Oh, sorry Norman, but we don't consume any animal byproducts."

Norman apologized. He hung-up the phone and went back to his game of Sorry. He was playing all four colors and it was blue's turn. He drew a 2 and squealed. He moved his piece out of start and reached for a second card.  He never thought of Porsis again.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5djwrr/norman_nearly_joins_a_cult/] createDate=[1479463401] score=[42] numComments=[4]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman has meatloaf for breakfast] author=[MillinerJones] text=[Norman was at his second-favorite grocery store because that morning he had forgone his traditional bowl of cereal in order to give the last cup of milk to Norman for his breakfast. Norman instead had meatloaf and mashed potatos for breakfast and subsequently had thrown his entire day off! That's why he wasn't prepared when he saw Lisa browsing the Greek yogurt next to the milk at his second-favorite grocery store.

.

"Oh hi Norman!" Lisa threw a smile at him that made the refrigerated cabinets of milk seem dull and yellow. Norman scrambled and tried to gather himself after the unexpected encounter.

.

"H-Hey Lisa" He eventually stammered.

.

"It's funny seeing you here," Lisa continued, "I come here all the time and never run into you."

.

Norman was blindsighted by her insistance on having a conversation in the dairy section. He frantically searched around his mind for a response, which was, at the moment, as blank and empty as his bottle of milk at home.

.

"Funny it is, yeah" Norman managed to muster. "I never really thought you were the kind of person to go to the grocery store."

.

Lisa laughed lightly at Norman's remark and placed a few containers of strawberry-flavored Greek yogurt into her shopping trolly. Norman turned a small smile in her direction while he reached blindly and grabbed at bottles of milk.

.

"You are an absolute riot, Norman!" Lisa said to him, still chuckling. Then she and Norman exchanged a quick wave, and resumed their shopping.

.

Terrified of running into Lisa again, Norman hurried to the registers, taking a wide detour to avoid the dairy section. His heart didn't stop racing until he had parked his car in his driveway.

.

"You wouldn't believe who I ran into at the store, Norman!" he told his cat when Norman got home. Norman regailed his cat with his tale as he poured himself a bowl of cereal for dinner. With the first spoonful he knew he had grabbed skim milk instead of his usual whole milk. "That's okay," Norman thought, "I'll grab some whole milk tomorrow from my new favourite grocery store."

.

Norman skipped his normal after-dinner CSI and went straight to bed after dinner; he had had enough excitement that day. "That," Norman thought as he drifted off to sleep, "is the last time I have meatloaf for breakfast."] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/54uqu5/norman_has_meatloaf_for_breakfast/] createDate=[1475066518] score=[46] numComments=[3]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman enters a creative writing contest.] author=[TURD_THIEF] text=[Norman sat anxiously in his recliner. He took a deep breath and looked around to see if norman was asleep. Glancing to the couch he saw Norman curled up and purring softly, sleeping soundly, with no knowledge of the weight of the matter at hand. Norman almost envied his blissful ignorance,  yet at the same time was excited he stumbled upon this opportunity. With Norman being asleep he knew this was his best chance to begin. Norman reached slowly into his jacket pocket. Pulling out its contents he unexpectedly found a JC Penny's receipt from the previous week he had forgotten to file with his other receipts.  "How could I be so careless?" He thought to himself.  However, Norman was much to excited about what he sat down to do and instead of filing the receipt in its proper place, Norman tucked it away in the "to file" section of his filing cabinet. Norman sat back down making sure not to wake Norman. Reaching back into his jacket pocket he pulled it out; a small leaflet of paper taken from a coffee shop bulletin board. It read: "Creative Writing Contest: 1st palce $20 Walgreens giftcard." Norman had always wanted to write short stories and had fond memories of the time in high school where he almost signed up for a creative writing course. "This is it." Norman said quietly to himself,  "This is the day the world meets Norman; short story author." 

After many hours, it was finished and ready to be submitted. Norman patted Norman's head and filled up his food bowl with a special treat for being so good while he wrote his story. Hopping in his car he sat out for the coffee shop. When he arrived the reality of the situation sat in, "it's now or never" he thought. As he got out of the car he almost forgot his story. Walking into the building he looked over to the contest flyer on the bulliten board and could see this was the last day to submit any work. He noticed only 6 of the original 10 leaflets hanging from the flyer. Norman knew he had competition. Walking to the counter he handed the barista his most prized possession asking, "When will the winner be announced?" She said they'll post the results on the bulletin board a week from today. Norman thought that to be an eternity. With a sigh of relief he walked to the door with a slight smile as his eyes made contact with the flyer again. 

The days seemed to stand still and Norman's anxiety grew. Monday came and went, then Tuesday, Wednesday,  Thursday. The weekend was close, friday dragged by. Norman could have swore he saw the hands on the clock moving backwards as Saturday neared. Finally, it was Sunday. Today was the day. Norman gathered his nerves and after his normal sunday morning routine made his way to the coffee shop. "Breathe" he thought. His palms were sweaty. Entering the shop he approached the bulletin board.  There it was, the results. Norman closed his eyes, took a deep breath, reopened them to see the list of winners:

    1st prize: Darlene McMann

    2nd prize: Yvonne Bates

    3rd prize: Stephen Marks

And there it was. His name in what seemed to be lights. 

    Honorable mention: Norman

Norman exhaled.  He couldn't have been more satisfied. "I may not have won 1st place" he thought "but now people know me." 


The end.

<comment number=[1]author=[MattressCrane]text=[It's in a weird spot. It's finished, and will undoubtedly be published. But for the past number of months, the problem has been the artwork; trying to get people over the internet to contribute their pieces and have them finished. There's an illustration for every month, and this summer I went and messaged dozens of artists, collaborating knowing full well that not everyone would finish. Now though, things are tricky- the only things left are December, without spoiling things it's important that the image there follows a specific theme, which makes it hard to ask just anyone. More on that, what makes it difficult is knowing that there's only one left- so I only can contact one person at a time, roughly, and pitch them the project. Then, to be fair I give the person a few weeks to a month for the piece, and then, if they don't finish... I have to start over. December has been the hardest, by far. I'm on the verge of commisioning the piece and paying for it myself, but I'm in the midst of becoming dirt broke during a job hunt, so I'm still just having to rely on people working for free.

There were no grape nuts in this cart, no egg beaters or golden raisins, this was certainly not his. 

He tried to determine where he might have switched carts - it must have been in the condiments aisle. But now Norman was faced with a dilemma. Does he continue pushing the delinquent cart as he looks for his own? Bring it back to the condiments? Search for the owner of the cart? 

But, Norman thought, what if he found his own cart before he found the owner of this one? He couldn't push both carts at once. Norman began to get flustered. He took his hands off the steering bar so as not to be directly associated with the cart. 

Then he realized, what else had he added to this cart that wasn't originally there? He didn't want the shopper to accidentally buy products they didn't want, but he didn't want to mistakenly remove something from their cart. 

"Maybe I should just start over with a new cart..." Norman thought... "Or push this one to customer service. But then I would call too much attention." 

Norman,  shamefaced, sidled away from the cart and began his shopping over again with a fresh one. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/56p82a/norman_accidentally_pushes_someone_elses_cart/] createDate=[1476088400] score=[47] numComments=[11]>

Norman was shopping in the grocery section of his local big box store when, to his horror, he realized the cart he'd been pushing was not his own. There were no grape nuts in this cart, no egg beaters or golden raisins, this was certainly not his.

If you start with the list of missing things as Norman would naturally discover them, it would lead up to the realization that this isn't his cart. So something like:

Norman was shopping in the grocery section of his local big box store. While strolling the isles he glanced at his cart, and suddenly notices there were no grape nuts. He clearly remembered walking past the nut-section earlier. He looked again, and he also couldn't see his golden raisins, which he was sure he picked up. Instead, he saw a bottle of sweet white wine. With a shock he realized *this was not his cart!*

...

"3 M" it said on the packaging, next to a pictograph of a clock. Norman smiled to himself. He knew better. He had been making popcorn for years, and the 3 minute instruction produces subpar popcorn.

"Here's the thing", he said, as if addressing an audience. "Most popcorn kernels in these bags pop around the two minute mark. The key is listening carefully at this point, detecting a slight 2-3 second gap in sound after the major wave of pops has passed, then shutting the microwave off immediately".

Norman set the clock for 3 minutes, pressed "START", and waited. As he looked at the raindrops racing each other down the window, he reconsidered his bins. "It's raining pretty hard", he thought. "How long would it take for a bin to fill up?"

He gave this some thought, but he wasn't sure. He could feel himself getting slightly anxious, and before he knew it he had his boots on, grabbed his coat off the hook, covered his head, and ran out into the rain. He grabbed the bins, and tried to move them, but they were already too heavy with water. He had no choice but to empty them out first. And so he did, and carried the bins inside.

When he closed the door behind him, he heard how the microwave started beeping. Norman sighed.

Norman knew that he no longer had to be at the office, but the thought of Norman not being fed on time made him feel uneasy.  Lisa had already left.  He was torn between his excitement to finish his fourth report of the day and his desire to keep his cat from getting hungry.  He decided to come in early to finish the report in the morning.  

On his drive home, the traffic light two blocks from his apartment turned yellow.  He quickly decided to slow down rather than risk speeding through and having the light change to red.  The car came to a stop that was a little more sudden than Norman was comfortable with.  Norman enjoyed the Eagles song on the radio while he waited for the light to change.  

As the elevator doors opened he saw a man who lived on his floor approaching the entrance to the apartment.  He decided to hold the elevator doors for him.  "Thanks," said his neighbor.  "No problem!" Norman excitedly replied.  The man pressed the button with the number 4 on it after waiting for what seemed too long a time.  

When the doors opened, there was a bit of confusion on who would get off the elevator first.  Norman, a little out of character, quickly and nervously exited.  His neighbor, not looking up from his phone, accidentally stepped on the back of Norman's shoe, causing it to come off.  "My bad, dude" said the man.  "It's okay, it happens" said Norman as he bent over to put it back on.  

As Norman knelt in the hallway to adjust his shoe, he heard the door to room 410 close from down the hall. 

"I made a new friend today!" Norman happily thought.  He fed Norman more than the normal two and a half scoops that day.  ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4tnb0e/norman_gets_a_flat_tire/] createDate=[1468988792] score=[43] numComments=[5]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Goes to Visit His Best Friend] author=[AkiAbe] text=[Today was the one day a year that Norman allowed himself to deviate from his otherwise meticulous schedule.

Norman was up much earlier than normal and was scooping out a half of a can of tuna for Norman as the sun was rising. 

Norman knew he was in no rush. Still he wanted to leave early. He hadn’t seen his best friend in almost a year. 

As Norman left the house he said goodbye to Norman who was streached out on the couch still asleep.

As Norman was pulling out of his driveway he once again checked to make sure that he had three small objects on his passenger seat: a journal with a bow tied around it, a small cylinder, and a small potted plant he had bought the night before sitting on the passenger seat.

He couldn’t forget anything behind on accident. Not today.

The nervousness of seeing his best friend once again almost made Norman’s hands shake, but he knew that he couldn’t let that get the better of him.

Norman drove a few hours until he came to the gates. He sat in his car, parked outside.

Norman was now nervous.

He didn’t know if his friend would recognize him after a year. People can change, even in a year, right? 

After a few moments of gathering his courage, Norman drove through the gates. He could see where his best friend waiting for him. He pulled to a stop, got out of his car, was careful not to forget his presents, and made his way to sit carefully next to his best friend.

He set the white carnations next to his best friend. 

“Hello there, it’s good to see you again. I can’t believe that it’s already been a year.” Norman’s best friend didn’t respond. 

From the small cylinder Norman drew forth a small American flag, which he unfurled and stuck into the soft soil of the carnation.

Pulling gently, Norman untied the bow around the book titled: “My Journal- May 25, 2015 to May 29, 2016”.

Starting at the first page, Norman recounted the adventures of the past year to his best friend.

It took many hours to read the book, but he sat there, surrounded by many other best friends, maybe not his, but best friends nonetheless. All with their own American flag in front of them.

The sun was going down and Norman hadn’t eaten since breakfast.

He stood brushing off a few blades of grass and specks of dirt. 

With a quiet, “Goodbye,” followed with a, “I’ll see you next year,” Norman left. But not without leaving a small, white, potted carnation with an American flag stuck in the dirt and a journal leaning against it on the headstone.

It was dark by the time Norman got home. He fed Norman, ate some leftovers, and made his way to bed. Before he turned out the lights, Norman pulled out another journal. This journal was titled: “My Journal- May 30, 2016 to May 28, 2017”.

On the first page, Norman began, “Today I went to see my little brother…”] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4ltumb/norman_goes_to_visit_his_best_friend/] createDate=[1464704525] score=[43] numComments=[5]>

</thread><thread title=[At the grocery store] author=[Ibelieveicanfly19] text=[Norman was at the grocery store. His cart now contained several items and he noted that he now only needed milk (skim; Norman was trying cut back on his calories) and eggs. He had just picked up some potatoes from the produce section and realized he would have to traverse the entire store to get his last two items. "What poor planning" Norman thought to himself. He had already passed the deli counter twice and was not looking forward to doing so again. "Can I get you some thing sir?" asked a smiling young man behind the counter. "No thank you" said Norman quickly. When he finally reached the refrigerator aisle he waited patiently behind an older couple who had left their cart in the middle of the aisle. Just as they were about to proceed the woman said to her husband "hold on, let me check and see if any of these eggs are broken". Norman wished she would do that somewhere else or simply let the cashier do it (they always did at this store). He thought about Norman who must be wondering where he was; he had been shopping for nearly half an hour now. "Next time I'll write my list to coincide with the layout of the store" Norman thought "that will make my trip much more efficient".

"Psst," said the woman sitting behind Norman, accompanied by a hard poke on the shoulder. "Could you please keep your laughter down? It's hard for the rest of us to enjoy the movie with you laughing so *damn* hard."

Norman nodded, slumping down in his chair.

</thread><thread title=[Norman is included] author=[Metafu] text=[*Bzzrt* *Bzzrt* *Bzzrt*

Norman glanced at his phone worriedly. In the past week it had been receiving messages far more frequently than usual. Norman knew it was the office groupchat that had been started up just last Monday, but decided to check his phone anyway in case it was something important, like the Words with Friends game he had started with his boss Daniel. He would have to be punctual for that.

*Bzzrt*

Norman paused the TV and hurried over to his phone. On the screen he could see an overwhelming 4 new messages. He figured he would sit back down to read them. As he sat down, the phone buzzed in his hand one more time. He knew it would be reckless to read the messages un-chronologically, who knew what context he could be missing, but upon seeing Lisa's name affixed to the yellow box, he decided to go ahead and risk it all anyways.

"Does anyone know if Norman is in this chat?"

Norman appreciated Lisa's concern, and started to type a response to inform her that he was. 

"Yes, Lisa, I a-

His texting was interrupted by another message.

"Who r u?"

Suddenly, a whole slew of messages blew through the phone.

"Why do you care?"

"I don't think so :/"

"We should go catch that new movie this Thursday Dennis."

Norman was taken aback by his sudden involvement in the conversation, and he looked back at his text message. Oh how woefully curt it was! He would seem rude if he sent that to Lisa- No, he would rewrite it. Norman deleted the text message after missing the backspace key only once, and began composing one anew.

"Ha, yes Lisa, don't worry, I am here. And Dennis, that is Lisa who asked if I was here. Just so you know."

Norman looked back on his work and shuddered. The ha he had put in to sound laid-back looked silly and forced, and his message still seemed condescending. He also decided it would be bothersome to send a message meant for just Lisa to everyone, so he started anew in a direct chat. His fingers trembled at the blank space above the message box. He had never sent Lisa a message before.

"Haha (Got it) yeah (Nice!) I'm in the chat. Why?"

Norman pushed send before he could hesitate any further. The why seemed out of place and imposing. He regretted sending the message at all. 

*Bzzrt* *Bzzrt*

Norman feverishly glanced at the screen, searching for a reply. The messages were from the other chat. The topic seemed to have moved on to fantasy football, but Norman didn't care much for sports. After sitting next to his phone for a few more hours, Norman decided to get some rest. The excitement from anticipating a conversation with Lisa would take a toll on his body if he didn't make up for it with a few extra hours of sleep.

As Lisa drifted off to sleep that night, she wondered if she should have texted Norman back. No, she thought, she could always just go alone, she wouldn't want to impose on him. Besides, she was sure he was much too busy with other things that Thursday.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5q7z1r/norman_is_included/] createDate=[1485429627] score=[41] numComments=[2]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman does some math] author=[lukevangorder] text=[Norman was home late one night watching CSI with Norman on his lap. He sat there and heard his stomach growl, causing Norman to jump off of Norman. *I suppose I should find something to eat* he thought.

Norman went to the kitchen to find some food, but found his pantry to be bare, except for a single can of pineapple slices. He remembered that he was going to go to the store earlier that day, but there was a homeless man out in front of the store and Norman only had his credit card Norman had decided it would just be easier to avoid the man and the store all-together. "What am I going to eat, Norman?" asked Norman. 

Thinking fast, Norman called the nearby Pizza Hut and orders one medium cheese pizza.

While waiting for the pizza, Norman sat in his chair and thought about how much the pizza would cost. *If the pizza is 5.99, and tax is 7%, then 7% of 1 is .07, so 7% of 6 is about .40. That should be about right.* Norman was very proud of his ability to do math.

When the pizza man arrived, he asked Norman for 5.75. This was not the amount that Norman had calculated, but Norman agreed that this would be the right amount. This man was a professional after all.

Norman reached for his wallet when he remember that he had no cash. Not wanting to embarrass the delivery boy or himself, he slammed the door shut.

Norman sat down and continued to watch CSI with a can of pinnaple in front of him. "I didn't really need the calories anyways, right Norman?"] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5q3anr/norman_does_some_math/] createDate=[1485381514] score=[40] numComments=[5]>

Norman heard an unexpected click in the entry way. "The mailman must be here early"  Norman thought. He walked to his his door to see the mail slot had three letters. The first was a coupon for a local pet store. "I'll keep these for when I get Norman some more food"  Norman thought.  The second was an election advertisement. Norman immediately shuttered at the thought of having to make such a big decision. He looked at the last letter to see a bill for the Veterinary clinic he took Norman to for his yearly check-up last week. 

He opened it up to find that the $72 bill was completely wrong. "Oh dear, I better go fix this as soon as possible." 

Norman got his coat and drove the 2 miles to the vet. Norman walked right up to the reception desk with bill in hand.  "Excuse me miss, I noticed this bill for last week's visit is incorrect. My cat Norman had his yearly check-up and he also got his nails trimmed, however the bill only accounts for the check-up and booster shot."

“Hello.” Norman said back to the woman sitting beside him in the auditorium. Currently, the motivational speaker was forcing everyone to have a conversation with the person sitting beside them. Norman was forced to have a conversation with a woman wearing white khaki shorts and a pink blouse. Norman didn’t know what to say next, after “hello”. His conversations usually don’t make it this far.

“My name’s Claire,” said the woman. “and I hate long walks on the beach.”

“I’m Norman,” said Norman, “and I don’t like beaches either.”

“Where are you from?” asked Claire. Norman told her all about his life in his office building, of his daily responsibilities, and of course, Norman.

“You have a cat named Norman too?” Claire laughed. It didn’t seem like a teasing laugh, so Norman joined in and laughed with her. “I guess that is different from normal,” Norman added.

Claire talked about her own experiences as well. She also worked in an office for the same company, only in a city far far away from Norman’s own. She was a receptionist. Aside from her not having any pets, Norman still felt that he had made a friend today. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4i25n0/norman_and_claire_have_to_talknorman_goes_on/] createDate=[1462513681] score=[43] numComments=[0]>

The morning routine was uneventful as Norman enjoyed. His attention though was pulled towards the door of the basement as Norman continued his pacing, now between Norman and the door. "This is highly unusual Norman, but let us see what is keeping you awake". 

Norman opened the door and the familiar smell brought a sigh through his body. Norman quickly ran towards a box labeled "Her Things", Norman walked over and opened it with hesitation, keeping his composure he looked in. "aha! I see now", Norman jumped in the box and grabbed his toy mouse and immediately ran upstairs leaving Norman alone in the secluded area. Another sigh. Norman closed the box in the same manner as when he did when she left, being sure to leave things neat in case she ever returned....'for her things'.

He just couldn't seem to stay asleep. How was he going to function at work tomorrow if this kept up? Then he realised something was making him uncomfortable. It was some odd pressure in his abdomen. Through the haze of drowsiness he finally fixated on the problem. He needed to urinate.

Norman got out of bed, careful not to kick a sleeping Norman who was curled at his feet, and went to the lavatory.

He had an important meeting downtown, so Norman was to take the bus 748, whilst waiting he couldn't figure out what he forgot, he had his keys, his old flip phone, his wallet, his briefcase, his good tie... What was missing? But then it hit him.
A bus was arriving and Norman couldn't read the number, he asked an old lady which bus was it. 
"Well cutie [Norman smiled], that's 755, goes downtown and then goes by the mall, that's where I'm going, my grandson is waiting for me there, we're going to the movies" said the old lady with a warm voice.
Norman thought to himself "I'm lucky this one also goes downtown".
He thanked the old lady, let everybody in the bus first then he got in.

Norman arrived 1 minute late to the meeting, he was nervous somebody might comment that, but alas he was the first to arrive. He sat down near the whiteboard.

When the rest of the employees came in one approached Norman and asked him "Hey Norman might if we switch seats? I forgot my glasses at home".
Norman agreed and switched seats with him to which his friend thanked him for.
Norman's new seat was on the other side of the table, he couldn't see anything, but still he though to himself "You give and you get, that nice lady helped me and now I help my friend, hope she's having fun".

</thread><thread title=[Norman goes to the theatre] author=[TurnDownForPage394] text=[Norman got an envelope in the mail from a mysterious sender. Inside were two tickets to the theatre with a note saying "For you and a friend." He didn't recognize the handwriting, but then again he didn't think much about it. He was more worried about which "friend" he would take, as he didn't really have any "friends" to begin with. 

Eventually Norman worked up the nerve to ask Carl, the man whose cubicle was next to his and with whom he occasionally feigned interest in the local sports team. Carl said it was his anniversary with his wife, so he couldn't go. Norman then asked Paula, the secretary, but she claimed she had special plans with her fiancée. Norman blushed at that notion. Finally he settled with Jake, the intern, who would certainly be free for the night. Jake agreed readily, stating his love for the musical. 

However, that night Jake said that he suddenly had to take his dog Jake to the vet, so Norman was left without a companion for the evening. "No matter!" said he. "I will enjoy the show myself!"

Norman treated himself to a nice dinner at the Olive Garden and then made his way toward the theatre. It was a massive concert hall packed with people, as apparently that night's production had been very popular in its previous run. He took his seats- very respectable, toward the left in the eighth row- and prepared for the show to begin. 

He realized as he was sitting down that the man sitting beside him smelled quite foul, though it was clear he could not say anything for fear of offending the poor gentleman. However, Norman found the odor rather distracting to the otherwise excellent play. When intermission came and the crowd filed toward the bathroom and concession stand, Norman remained in the hall and quickly, after looking around, slipped into what would have been his "friend's" seat. 

The smelly man returned at the end of intermission and cast Norman a strange glance, but Norman pretended not to notice. The rest of the show was significantly more to his liking, as he found himself no longer distracted by the man's stench. He could focus on the dazzling colonial costumes and the hard-hitting libretto. He wanted desperately to thank the mysterious sender, but still could not fathom who it could have been.

After the show Norman stood to leave, but with horror noticed that the stinky man had turned to him. He tried to avoid eye contact, but then the man began to speak. Norman's palms were sweaty. His heart pounded. The man was going to accuse him of making fun of his body odor! He was going to angrily insult Norman! 

"Great show, don't you think?" the man asked. "I didn't know if it was worth all the praise, but it definitely was!"

"Yes, it certainly was," muttered Norman. 

He quickly made his way out of the theatre and sped home (not a millimeter over the speed limit, mind you) in his car. He had to know who had given him the tickets. As he reached his house, he flew into the kitchen and opened the envelope once again. The note had been folded at the bottom. What it really said was: "For you and a friend. Enjoy the show. With love, Norman."

Norman pinned the note to the bill item board in his kitchen and went to bed smiling. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5ajozb/norman_goes_to_the_theatre/] createDate=[1478042922] score=[42] numComments=[8]>

What Norman discovered was that underneath his right foot was the empty peel of a banana. 

Norman's first reaction was to panic, as decades of television had convinced him that banana peels were dangerous to step on.

Norman stood there for two full minutes, uncertain if his luck at remaining upright came from standing still, or from banana peels not really being slippery.

As carefully as possible, Norman shifted all of his weight to his left foot, which was not standing on a banana peel. Then, he lifted his right foot. The banana peel stayed with the ground.

Norman walked away still not really sure if banana peels are slippery.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/55gsum/norman_steps_on_a_banana_peel/] createDate=[1475410319] score=[39] numComments=[1]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman's Desk Calendar] author=[Chrdav65] text=[“Time flies, June is almost over.” Norman thought to himself as he looked down at his desk calendar. Norman always kept one pen, one highlighter, and white-out right next to the calendar. Norman typically didn’t like things laying on his desk, instead preferring everything be placed in their proper holder, but Norman liked the easy access to these items he used so frequently.

Norman would mark an “X” with his pen on each day as it passed and was very careful to make his “X” perfectly between the lines. He noticed that Thursday the 16th’s line slightly went over into Friday the 24th’s writing area.

“I won’t make that same mistake next month.” Norman thought to himself.

Norman would use his green highlighter to indicate very important meetings. Occasionally, a dilemma would occur in which Norman wasn’t sure if a particular meeting warranted a highlighted reminder, but Norman felt that he got it right more often than not. 

The white-out, well the white-out is something Norman hoped he would never have to use. Sometimes his supervisor would cancel a meeting that Norman penned in weeks earlier and Norman didn’t like how this made his neat calendar look. Looking down at his calendar again, Norman felt disappointment in himself about the 20th, where he accidentally whited-out over “Sum” in “Summer begins”, and felt obligated to white out the entire phrase to maintain consistency.

As Norman continued to review his calendar he noticed something that very much excited him. The 1st of July would land on Friday. This means the spots where Monday through Thursday would be on the beginning of that month would remain blank. Norman ceased this rare opportunity to flip his calendar over to July and carefully penned in 27th for Monday, 28th for Tuesday, 29th for Wednesday, and 30th for Thursday. Norman was careful to make his writing look as similar as possible to the font already placed on the calendar. This would ensure that Norman would avoid the dreaded last week of the month in which he had to constantly flip his calendar over to write in next month’s meetings while still in the current month.  

Norman was pleased as he looked down at his calendar and knew this was the beginning of a great day. Later that night, CSI was showing one of his favorite episodes as a re-run. Norman’s cat, Norman jumped up and laid down on his lap and he began to pet him. 

“July’s coming a little early this year, Norman.” Norman said as he smiled.

</thread><thread title=[Norman takes the train] author=[Cygnus--X1] text=[Norman was waiting for the 13.19 train. It was Sunday afternoon and the station was almost empty, and Norman stood watching for the yellow and blue train that arrived exactly on time. He got in and settled himself down on the window seat of a four-seater. There were a few other people in the carriage, all of them alone and looking at their phones, reading papers or listening to music. It was peaceful here.

The first leg of Norman's trip was quiet and beautiful. As soon as the train left the station, Norman's mind drifted off into nothingness, quietly taking in the green fields the train casually rode by. In his mind, Norman imagined a little man hopping along over obstacles like trees, rivers or sheds that were on the route. It was a game he had played in his head ever since he was a kid, though he had never told anyone about the silly imagination.
Then Norman thought about what he'd say if someone asked where he was going. He always had a backstory prepared about visiting friends in a nearby city, just in case someone, like a conductor, would ask. Thankfully, that hadn't happened yet, so Norman went back to enjoying the beautiful view or the countryside.

When Norman's train arrived at the first station, he noticed something strange. The platform was more crowded than usual. Way more crowded. Normally, there would hardly be any people here, that never had been, not on Sunday afternoons, but this time Norman saw even from the window that there were a lot of passengers here, making it seem almost like rush hour.

When the train stopped, the massive crowd squirmed itself into the carriage. In no time, all seats were taken, and some people even had to keep standing. Norman's four-seater was full too, and he had to sit up straight not to touch knees with a rather annoyed looking man opposite him. Next to him there was a woman who had headphones on. Norman could hear the beats of her music.

As the train left the station, the conductor spoke over the intercom. "Ladies and gentlemen, as you've noticed we're a little over our usual capacity. This is due to a reroute elsewhere, which made us pick up some more passengers. We apologize for the inconvenience."

Norman tried to ignore the crowd and stared outside again, but he simply couldn't enjoy the landscapes anymore. His mind kept going to the man opposite him, wondering if he wasn't bothering him with his knees. He also kept glancing at a women who was standing up, and contemplated whether she was old enough that he should offer her his seat or that she might be offended because he'd think she was too old. He decided not to do it.

The next 20 minutes weren't much fun. Norman didn't enjoy his trip at all and decided to get out at the next station. When he'd squeezed  himself through the other passengers in the aisle, muttering "excuse me"s under his breath and gently elbowing his way around them to the doors, he found the platform deserted. He went to the little kiosk on the station and bought a large coffee to go, and sat down on one of the benches. 

He patiently waited for the next train which would arrive in only 29 minutes. He didn't mind. He didn't have a particular destination anyway.

</thread><thread title=[Norman forgets something at home] author=[[deleted]] text=[Norman was in a hurry.

Though the speed limit signposted on much of Norman's commute home from work was 40 miles per hour, Norman's excitement to get home and charge his mobile phone was such that he pushed the gas pedal quite hastily. He was dangerously nearing 44 miles per hour, which was faster than the legal limit and not the kind of reckless behavior Norman would normally condone. But today Norman had coughed up a hairball just as Norman had been on his way out the door, and Norman had been so distracted by stopping to clean it up that he had left his mobile phone charger at home. It was a rotten day for Norman to forget the charger because he was awaiting a call from a woman he had met Friday night with whom he had been getting on famously.

She had told Norman she would call him today, and he felt just terrible about leaving the voicemail she must have left unanswered on his dead mobile phone. What must she be thinking of him? Would she want to talk to him at all anymore, or had he blown his chance with her? He imagined her giving up after trying his phone again and again; placing it out of sight so she wouldn't try to contact him again. Would she think Norman didn't like her? Or would she just assume he was very busy, after all? Would she refuse to talk to Norman if he called her back this evening? Norman hoped it wouldn't come to that. He would just have to call her as soon as he got in the door and plugged his phone in and explain the situation.

When Norman finally pulled into his driveway, he hurriedly raced out of the car and trotted up his porch steps two at a time. Norman greeted him as he opened the front door but Norman was in too much of a hurry to stoop down and pet him.

At last, triumphantly, Norman plugged his charger into the wall and connected it to his mobile phone. He waited for all of the calls he had received that day to flood onto his screen. They didn't. Norman waited a moment longer, but still no missed calls appeared. She hadn't called that day, it seemed. That was okay, Norman thought. She must be very busy, after all.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4hqmsr/norman_forgets_something_at_home/] createDate=[1462340655] score=[41] numComments=[3]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman's morning alarm] author=[Voodoopie] text=[It was Sunday afternoon, and Norman was doing his least favourite load of laundry, the darks. He glanced thoughtfully at his trusty alarm clock, and considered how faithfully it went off at 7am every single morning. 

Norman suddenly considered setting another alarm on the clock for 6:50am the next day. That way, he could trick himself and indulge in a 10 minute sleep-in, still arriving half an hour early for work the next day. 

That night as Norman was climbing between his fresh, navy sheets, he had second thoughts about setting another alarm. For the past 20 years he had always only set one alarm, for the same time, on the same Philips Digital Alarm Clock he won custody of in the divorce. What if he didn't program it correctly, and neither alarm went off? Or he accidentally set it for 6:50pm INSTEAD of 6:50am? Norman shuddered at the possibility. 

After several seconds of internal debate, Norman decided to set the alarm for 6:55am instead. He would wake up 5 minutes earlier instead of sleeping in, spicing up his everyday routine responsibly.

Norman smiled as he drifted off, thinking he would even have an extra 5 minutes in the morning to spend with Norman. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5uk5j5/normans_morning_alarm/] createDate=[1487333489] score=[36] numComments=[4]>

With a shaking hand he checked his watch. It had been twenty-two minutes since he had taken the pill, and the man on the street corner had explicitly said he should begin feeling the effects after twenty.

Perhaps the man had lied, and had conned Norman out of a twenty dollar note. Just as he was contemplating taking another to see if that would change anything, it hit him. He let out a long, soft sigh.

He turned to Norman, "Incredible, my headache has completely cleared!" he marvelled. Norman, who had been dozing next to him, looked up sleepily and blinked.

Norman sat back and took another look at the sample packet the salesman had passed him. Paracetamol really seemed to be just as effective as his standard aspirin. In future, Norman decided, he would still get aspirin, because he knew exactly where it was located at his local store, but he was proud of himself nonetheless for having tried something new.

</thread><thread title=[Norman gets robbed.] author=[SirPasta117] text=[Today was an exciting day for Norman. It had been two whole weeks since his last pay day and as Norman walked up to the teller at his local branch she had to ask Norman to wait while as she unbundled a fresh pack of $20s. Norman admired how neatly the stack looked with their perfectly aligned edges and pristine paper fronts. Norman quickly decided to add an additional $20 to this weeks allowance just so he can walk around with those perfect bills.

He excitedly handed over his paycheck with a sloppy signature on the rear and asked not-to-eagerly for $40 in cash. As she set two crisp $20 bills on the counter Norman quickly admired them before stuffing them into his wallet. As he left the build and walked to his car his mind raced on what to spend one of the $20 bills on. Content as usual Norman finally decided to splurge and purchase a bag of his favorite candies.

Soon he had pulled up to a nearby gas station and began to peruse the candy selection. After selecting his candy and waiting his turn in line walked up to the cashier. 'Lexi' Her name tag read on her vest. She was deeply engrossed in a conversation with someone on the phone. Norman wondered for a moment who it was. Perhaps she had taken the time to call her father.

Norman set his bag of candy on the counter and without an attempt from either party to make eye contact Lexi quickly scanned his candy as Norman pulled a fresh $20 from his wallet, smiling as he did so. "2.19." Lexi managed to say in between sentences of her conversation on the phone. Norman proudly handed her the $20 and Lexi quickly grabbed it, pressed a few buttons on the register and tucked the bill into its void.

She tucked the phone between her ear on shoulder as she pulled a few bills out and rattled out some change. She held out a fist full of crumpled dollars and dirty change offering it to Norman. He reached out and grabbed the money and quickly counted how much was there. A paltry $2.81 was sitting in Normans shaking hands. He stared at the pile and looked back to the cashier with words starting to form at the back of his throat. He had just begun to mutter "excuse m-" when the nearby door bell clanged as a new customer walked in. Suddenly aware of the line that would soon form behind him he stuffed the money in his pocket and walked out to his car.

It wasn't until later when he was re-telling the tale to the pile of fluff that was Norman did he also realize he never grabbed his candy off the counter as he left.

</thread><thread title=[Norman has an accident] author=[Freak_at_war] text=[Around 10am, while working in his cubicle Norman noticed a little pressure in his bladder. Normally he wouldn't need to urinate until his lunch break.  
This must be the consequence from selecting the medium coffee cup size instead of the usual small size at his coffee machine.  
As he made his way to the toilet area he tried to look busy, so his coworkers maybe wouldn't realize where he was headed, since this made him rather self conscious.  
Once he slipped into the restroom while making sure nobody looked his way he hurried to finish his business. After all he was not getting payed for going to the toilet.  
Since Norman is aware of environmental issues, he doesn't use toilet paper after urinating, but instead shakes the last drops off.  
But this time, since Norman was worried about finishing up fast, he shook the last drop off too violently and it splashed against his beige trousers, leaving a visible wet stain of the size of a fingernail.  
Norman was worried that anybody could see the wet stain on his trousers, should they see him leaving the restroom. And surely the'd know it was urine. So he went to the sink and splashed around in order to get several water stains all over his clothes. Now nobody would notice the wet stain on his trousers among all the obvious water stains above waist level.  
Happy with his solution Norman left the mens room and shuffled back to his cubicle, comfortable that nobody would realize what really had happened to his trousers.  
Norman started lunch break 2 minutes late, to compensate for his premature trip to the restroom. The entire time he was uncomfortable since his clothes were damp.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4shggd/norman_has_an_accident/] createDate=[1468364936] score=[41] numComments=[5]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Goes on Vacation, Part 3] author=[MattressCrane] text=[Norman departed from the airport’s parking lot like a badger swimming out of a pool of sweat. He had severely underestimated the vast difference in heat between his cloud-ridden home and the scorching blaze of the Hawaiian sun. Norman was currently visiting Hawaii on a mandatory-work vacation, and although his wet pudgey red face didn’t show it, Norman was secretly very excited.
	
“Hi there!” shouted a young lady wearing an airport issued uniform. “Sir, I was trying to tell you that I’m Mandy, and I’m here to show you to your hotel that the office rented for you. Okay?”

Norman shook his head and followed the woman back in the direction he walked from. Norman found it funny how she overly pronounced her name, as if she was speaking to an elderly person. Who does she think I am? Norman thought to himself. Norman saw the distance back to the entrance of the airport, and adjusted his speed accordingly so he wouldn’t be so tired when he reached the doors.

</thread><thread title=[Norman Organizes his Bookshelf] author=[TheDormHermit] text=[On Saturday evening, Norman decided to kill some time by organizing his bookshelf. He gently brushed the dust off of some of them and tried lining up the book titles by alphabetical order. Feeling quite productive, he came across his ex-wife’s old copy of Pride and Prejudice. 


With trembling hands, he ran his thumb down the spine of the book and blew away the dust. “I’d forgotten about this,” he mumbled to himself.  Norman flipped open the pages to reveal a dried-up rose petal.


Thirty-something years ago, a fresh-faced Norman shifted his weight from foot to foot outside an apartment door, holding a single rose with his right hand. He took extra care with his hair gel and sported the new shirt he got last weekend. A part of him wondered how someone like him ever landed a date with a girl like Melinda. 

The door opened suddenly, starting the rose out of Norman’s hand. Norman’s throat went dry. He silently cursed himself and muttered an apology before scrambling to pick up the fallen flower. As Norman was scrambling, his foot moved almost against his will, effectively crushing the rose.


Melinda laughed good-naturedly. She picked up one petal that was still in good shape and headed back into the room, leaving Norman dazed in his own embarrassment. She pressed the petal between the pages of the book on her living room table, “Now I’ll always have something to remember tonight,” she looked back at Norman. Her eyes concaved upward into crescent moons. The hallway lights reflected in her eyes, making them twinkle a bit, and Norman secretly wished she’d smile like this to him forever.


She always knew what to do.


Norman sat and stared at the petal. The memory brought a smile to his face. Which gradually faded as he got increasingly aware of his empty apartment. He balled his hands into fists, anticipating, longing for a sharp pain to attack his chest. Instead, he only felt a dull ache. Disappointed, he carefully tucked the petal back to its original place. After all, it was just a dried-up rose petal from years ago.

Norman left the rest of the bookshelf undisturbed. He checked his e-mails for the second time that day and waited for CSI to start.

</thread><thread title=[Norman Goes to See Junior (Part 2/4)] author=[MattressCrane] text=[[Click here for part one.](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/50qdam/normans_little_stomach_problem_part_14/)

The little pain in Norman’s stomach didn’t change from its mildly uncomfortable state, but now that it could be cancer, looming and growing slowly in his body, Norman couldn’t help feeling afraid. It was just so sudden. He lived a good life, he knew that. Not much had happened to Norman over the past decade, since he figured he would save all his energy for his fifties, and wait for time travel to be invented so he could go back and use his time more wisely. But he didn’t have a decade. If the doctor was correct, he only had two weeks.

Norman packed his cat into his travelling cage, a spacious box with a blanket at the bottom and a treat in the back, and prepared for the long drive into the city. Norman tried to think of the last time he saw his son. He had a phone conversation with him a couple months ago, for Father's Day, but that five minute conversation didn’t give Norman too much insight into how his son’s life had been going. Norman was hoping that his son was doing financially well, so that, if needed, Norman the cat wouldn’t be such a burden if he were to move in.

After a number of repetitive knocks on the door, it was finally answered by a young unknown woman.

“Can I help you?” she asked Norman. Norman felt uncomfortable with the situation, being a strange man knocking on the door, holding a cat in his arms. He just about turned away solemnly, when Junior spotted him.

“Dad? What are you doing here?” Junior came from the kitchen, holding a little kitten in his arms. Norman felt a pang of relief.

“Oh! I’m just here for a visit, is all. It’s been quite awhile, Junior.”

Junior cautiously invited his father into his apartment, and took a seat in his recliner.

***

“Looks like a new chair,” Norman commented.

“Jess bought it for me.” Junior said, nodding towards the young woman making three cups of coffee.

“What about the kitten?” asked Norman. He wondered if it’s name was Junior. 

“Ah, it was Jess’s idea. Her name is Annie.” Junior placed down Annie, letting the little cat scurry its way off the couch. Norman loosened his grip on Norman as well. 

“How’s your job?” asked Norman. 

“It’s good. I was just promoted to have a cubicle by myself, so that’s a nice change... Look, dad, is there a reason you stopped by? Not that I’m trying to shoo you out or anything..”

Norman hesitated. He didn’t want to burden his son with the news about the tumor. But he didn’t know what else to say. In the corner of the room, a fight broke out between the cats. 

Annie took a swipe at Norman as the larger cat cowered in the corner of the room. Norman sped from the couch, and so did Junior. 

“Bad Annie!” shouted Junior to Annie.

“Don’t do that,” muttered Norman to Norman.

“It’s time we put her in her cage.” said Junior. He hoisted Annie in his arms, took her near washing machines, and placed the cat in a moderately sized metal cage. 
	
“You shouldn’t put her in a cage like that, it’s uncomfortable.” said Norman. 

“She gets too rowdy at night, so we have to for now.”

Norman’s heart started to race. “You still shouldn’t do that.”

“Well, it’s my cat, so I’ll decide how I raise her.”

Norman wanted to say something back, but couldn’t find the courage.

“There’s a hair in my throat. I’m going to get going.” said Norman as he slipped on his shoes, grabbed his cat, and left the apartment. The cat started to purr as Norman went down the stairwell. Norman himself couldn’t stop shivering. *I’ll find you a home, the right home,* Norman thought to himself. *I’ll be sure of it.*

</thread><thread title=[Norman gets to work early] author=[SamwiseIAm] text=[Norman woke with a start. He looked at his clock, only to see he was 8 minutes late getting up to get ready for work. Did Norman somehow shut the alarm off without waking up? Did he forget to set it?

With no time to think, Norman sprang into action, heading to the bathroom without so much as putting on his slippers or robe. He brushed his teeth all too quickly to be as thorough as required, and briefly wondered what he would tell the dentist at his next appointment. Then Norman realized he was just standing in front of the mirror thinking too much panic set in again. He jumped in the shower without waiting for the water to turn warm. The cold water stung his skin, but he powered through the pain, his heart beating rapidly. Knowing that every precious minute he wasted he would be more and more likely to miss the bus, Norman decided against using conditioner but promised himself he would condition twice tomorrow! Norman's heart raced as he toweled off and when he put his shirt on he could tell the small of his back had not been thoroughly dried. Norman's internal voice shrieked in terror when he thought about the time that would be wasted changing to a dry shirt so instead he just threw on a coat to match his pants and headed for the door.

It was muggy out as Norman stepped onto the sidewalk and turned up the block toward the but stop. In moments Norman felt the summer heat and started sweating. He needed the coat to hide the wet spot on the back of his shirt, but now it was causing uncontrolled sweating and he just knew that the rest of his shirt would be soaked through soon enough. He struggled to get his coat off and saw the beginnings of dark marks around his arm pits. But the he was finally at the bus stop and he sat down to try and get control of his reeling mind.

Norman looked at his watch to see that not only was he not late, he was actually 20 minutes early! He let out a sigh of relief and sat back on the bench, closing his eyes and breathing deep breaths. When he felt calm again, he perked up and looked around. The bus stop was rather empty. Norman had never considered that an earlier bus might help to miss the morning traffic, and made a mental note to try and get up early on Mondays just to have some time to himself on the way to work from now on- what a lucky discovery! The day that started out so ominously was starting to look up.

The bus came and Norman got on. Seeing that there were only a couple other riders and he could essentially pick whichever seat he wanted sent a thrill through Norman and confirmed to him that getting up early at least once a week was a grand idea. He stopped sweating as he took his seat near the front and the air inside the bus was cool enough that he figured his shirt would be dry by the time he got to work. Yes, things were definitely looking up!

Twenty minutes later Norman got off and walked the block toward work feeling as though he was walking on clouds. When he reached for the door of the office, he was surprised to find that it was locked. Was he *too* early, perhaps? He looked about and then took a seat on the planter in front of the building to wait for someone to open the doors. A few minutes later and Norman spotted Harold, one of the security guards, coming around the corner.

"Good morning, Norman," said Harold amiabily.

"Good morning, Harold" replied Norman. "C-" 

Before Norman could ask Harold to open the door, he had a horrible realization: the missed alarm clock, the rush to get ready, the empty bus, they all came together to form a ball of nausea in the pit of Norman's stomach.

"What are you doing here on a Saturday, eh, trying to impress the boss?" Harold asked with a grin and knowing wink.

Norman mumbled out a response that must have been some sort of agreement with the notion, and Harold opened the door for him. Sitting at his cubicle, Norman stared off at nothing wondering how he could get himself out of this mess. If he left, Harold would know what a fool he was, but he wasn't authorized for overtime so he didn't dare do any work. If used his computer for non work-related reasons, he was sure he would be found out and let go, and he didn't even have a book to keep him company! Norman closed his eye and slowly lowered his head down until his forehead touched the edge of the desk. After 8 agonizing hours replaying his morning over and over and trying to spot how he could have realized his mistake before making it to the office, he finally headed out the door.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4u59kn/norman_gets_to_work_early/] createDate=[1469253931] score=[38] numComments=[3]>

___

Gladys had refused Norman's offer to drive them to the community center, and Norman was struggling to understand why. To be honest Gladys confused Norman more often than he cared to admit. As they walked out the front door of the apartment complex Gladys stopped to grab a discarded can from the flowerbeds. "I'd love to have a bench here, Norman. Right about..." she pointed to a shady spot between two flowering trees "there. Those magnolias are majestic, don't you think? With a little footpath leading there it would be perfect. I tell you, Norman. Not a place on Earth I'd rather be."

As the branches swayed and the rich smell of the blossoms wafted over Norman he found it hard to disagree. A block up the road Gladys was again staring at a tree. "These guys make conkers. You ever play conkers, Norman?" He hadn't, but he wondered if the two of them looked a bit daft standing there. He fidgeted a bit. Why hadn't they driven? There was free parking at the community center, but when he mentioned it at the apartment building Gladys' face went dark. "Parking lots are the enemy", she said with a flash in her eyes. Norman dared not vocalize any disagreement.

The more they walked, the more Norman learned about the neighborhood. He hadn't really explored the area since he moved into his apartment. It seemed to Norman that Gladys knew more about this stretch of town than anyone. Gladys seemingly knew everyone and waved to people as she told Norman stories. He struggled to keep up as Gladys' finger pointed out landmarks. "When Arnold and I first moved here that building was a theatre called the Prosperity. Double features were a dime in those days." Norman would have never guessed that of the humble laundromat.

There was a corner market on Saturdays here back then. That house on the right was once owned by two Belgians and made truffles that Gladys described with more colorful language than Norman was used to hearing. When they reached a non-descript parking lot Gladys paused. "This was once Amal's Dad's bakery. It was so good to see him again. I'm glad Faisal is doing well."

Before Norman had time to comment Gladys was already gone, chatting while beckoning Norman towards a place called the Caffe Valletta. "Leo! Anna! Merħba! Meet my friend Norman!" Norman hoped he sounded sincere while shaking hands and introducing himself. Norman declined an offer for espresso for fear of staying up too late.

As they carried on their way Norman thought about what Gladys said. "Meet my friend". He was her friend. That meant a lot to Norman. Even if he was a terrible partner against the wizards of Euchre he felt that Gladys would still care about him. Before he knew it they arrived. Some wrought-iron streetlamps had winked to life and Gladys was nose-deep in a flowerbed in front of the community center.

Norman dimly understood why Gladys would rather walk.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4miic1/norman_learns_about_the_neighborhood/] createDate=[1465079118] score=[37] numComments=[8]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman eavesdrops] author=[throwawaythatsmile] text=[Norman didn't have to look up to recognize the shrill voice that just landed by Lauren's desk. Amanda.

Everyone knew about Amanda's wedding saga, though no one wanted to know. Today's episode - which was airing 10 minutes before the end of the day, for some blasted reason - was how some "Jess" appointed herself as her maid of honor and was now coming to their dress shopping trip or something. And Amanda - she just didn't know what to *do*.

*Just tell her she can't?* Norman thought, mildly irritated.

"Just tell her she can't." Lauren said dryly. Norman couldn't give her a high five, so he gave himself a very discreet one over his keyboard. And another one for himself for being telepathic. 

"What? You're telling me to just - are you actually kidding me?" 

"Just say no, Amanda. Not that hard." 

"God. You don't get it. This is *Jess*. She'll *freak*." 

"Whatever." 

Norman stopped listening too. He never had the stamina to bear people like Amanda. People like her never really did anything to fix their problems, just strove to make them everyone else's problems too. Irrelevant drama followed Amanda into this office - never left - because she never said no.

All she had to do was say no. *Not that hard,* Norman whisper-quoted Lauren. 

A thin folder suddenly slapped itself down on Norman's desk, making him jump. "Hey, Norman," Craig's face appeared right next to his. "Mind finishing this report for me? I, uh, can't really get home too late tonight."

"CSI is unrealistic," his coworker had said; "those lab guys don't actually face the bad guys or even interrogate anyone".

He then reminded Norman that there was an episode where Jorja Fox surreptitiously finds a convenient bullet wound *immediately* after resolving one of her inner conflict tirades that often happened during the first seasons. Norman didn't like the episode either, so he relented on checking out the show that his coworker recommended instead.

Except, Norman wouldn't. Come Monday afternoon, Norman would return the first season of *The Wire* to the store.

"Tonight's the one where Grissom and Warrick stick it to that corrupt judge!" thought Norman, giddy with anticipation.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/57ogvs/norman_decides_to_return_the_dvd/] createDate=[1476599137] score=[34] numComments=[3]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Meets a New Friend] author=[MattressCrane] text=[In between the bus stop and Norman's apartment complex is a house, and in the front lawn of that house is an old black Labrador. The path wasn't the most efficient route- by taking this route, he ended up walking an extra two blocks each day. Each day, when Norman passes the dog on the walk to the bus stop, he would lay down his briefcase on the sidewalk. In a small compartment, beside his spot for pens, is a spot for little dog treats. The old Labrador's tail would wag happily every time Norman strolled by, without fail, giving the dog a little treat.
But one day the dog was not outside. Norman was worried, but figured that it perhaps had to do with the rain that was falling earlier that morning. He tried not to let it bother him.

As weeks passed, Norman realized the dog would not be coming back to sit outside. The treats in the little compartment were going stale. Norman sighed heavily each day he went down the block, and finally decided that there isn't any point to taking this route anymore. He returned to the regular routine.


As Norman walked down the new street, he passed by a house- and an old golden retriever sitting idly on the front lawn. Norman opened his briefcase. "I think I'll come this way for now on", Norman told the happy dog.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/52cn17/norman_meets_a_new_friend/] createDate=[1473683469] score=[34] numComments=[4]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman gets annoyed] author=[PizzaWithKetchup] text=[It was a regular Wednesday day at the office. 
Norman, in his cubicle, clicked the the "refresh" icon on Outlook to see if he got any new emails. Nope, nothing new.

As he was about to start working on a new file, he heard Debra sigh from two cubicles away. Norman regained his focus, and looked back at his file in front of him.

Again, another sigh from Debra. In a monotone voice, she turned to Carol and said "I hate how women have to work twice as hard to earn the same as man, men have it so easy!".

This statement made Norman raise his eyebrows, he was intrigued. 

"Like, we work hard, and they do nothing. We make 2/3 of their salary, they're so lazy".

Norman, looked down at his paper, and instantly felt his blood pressure go up. When she asked to leave early, he took care of her work. When she didn't know how to fix the printer, she asked him to do it and he always did it. When she forgot her lunch and ate his, he didn't say anything. When she asked him to stay late last-minute, he did! 

Norman took three deep breaths, and let out a sigh of his own. "It's not worth it" Norman thought to himself. Even though he did not know how to respond her, he knew he wanted to say something bad to her. But doing that wouldn't be professional, and he knows that avoiding any conflict is important.

[Thirty minutes after this event]

"Hey Norman, I'm heading out early to pick up my son. You don't mind finishing up my last 6 documents right? Thanks" Debra said as she walked out the door before giving Norman a chance to even say a word back to her.

A few weeks went by, and Norman decided to watch one of his favorite old episodes of CSI, feeling a little nostalgic.

"She's exquisite", Norman tried to think of his cats while he approached her. 

"Excuse me miss... excuse me."

</thread><thread title=[Norman gets gas.] author=[rillip] text=[On his way home from work Norman noticed the gas tank on his car was a little under half. This was unusual as normally he filled it twice a week on Mondays and Thursdays and this meant the car was never below half.

So he stopped at one of his regular gas stations, the one close to home, and pulled in at pump number one. A large piece of paper taped to the pump explained that the card reader was out of order and that customers wishing to buy gas would need to prepay with cash at the counter. 

Norman was both annoyed and delighted by this. Annoyed because it was yet another unforseen change to his plans for the evening. Delighted because situations like this were exactly why he always kept a crisp twenty dollar bill in his wallet. He proceeded inside the store. 

There was no line and he went straight to the counter.

"I would like $20 on number..." He faltered. Reece's Cups were on sale two packages for only two dollars. They were his favorite and he decided to live a little.

"... make that $17 on number one and two Reese's." He wasn't sure how much the tax would be. The attendant gave him eighty-two cents back. 

When he got home he decided to leave one pack in his cupboard for later. He set the other on his kitchen counter. He'd have it for dessert later. Then he left to have his post-work bathroom visit. 

Norman hopped up on the counter and sniffed at the foreign object in his home. He batted it experimentally with his paw. It moved a little. Intrigued he batted it a bit harder. Then he batted it very much harder indeed. The packet shot off the table and slid under the refrigerator. The toilet flushed in the other room and Norman, startled, leapt from the counter completely forgetting the object. 

Norman would not remember the Reese's until his drive to work the next morning. At which point he would shrug and focus on driving. Unable to recall if he had eaten them or not. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5uqgqi/norman_gets_gas/] createDate=[1487415946] score=[34] numComments=[3]>

The puzzle was hard though, and Norman had to focus- he had never been especially good at putting things together.

Suddenly a loud yell interrupted him. Norman looked up, wondering what the commotion was. He heard another yell, and realized then that it was only the neighbors. They were a lovely young couple, only recently married. They went out to eat together on the weekends, and the husband would sometimes bring flowers home for his wife. Unfortunately they seemed to always be fighting about something.

</thread><thread title=[Norman's Little Stomach Problem (Part 1/4)] author=[MattressCrane] text=[Norman had a stomach ache that he just couldn’t shake. At first, he figured it was the Chinese food he had a number of nights ago, since it was the first time he had ever eaten Chinese branded sushi. He discounted it after a Google search, learning that what he had eaten was still just sushi, and that every other time he had food poisoning from sushi it happened only hours after consumption. Secondly, he figured it had to do with how much sitting he had been doing lately. Eight hours a day at work, thirty minutes on the commute home, and another four sitting in front of the television. He discounted that as well, as he’s been doing that routine for many years. Thirdly he figured it had something to do with the large amounts of chicken breasts he’d been eating. *Buying in bulk has its consequences*, Norman thought. However, once the pain was sharp and no longer became tolerable or ignorable, Norman went to the doctor.

Dr. Melfi made Norman do a few different tests, more than what Norman was expecting. After so many hours, years, of watching CSI, he realized that he’s never seen a healthy person be examined before. *Autopsies seem less invasive than this*, Norman thought to himself.

“Please, take a seat Norman.” said Dr. Melfi as he was escorted into her office. Norman took a seat in the leather chair and imagined he was in a very big important meeting at work.

“What’s your plan, Norman? What are you going to do when you leave this office?”

“Probably... get something to eat. Unless I can’t.”

“What about a couple weeks from now? What’s your plans?”

Norman thought long and hard. “I prefer to live in the moment, I suppose.” 

Dr. Melfi sighed, more so in a rehearsed fashion than a genuine sigh; like a yawn taking place because someone else was doing one and you didn’t want them to feel so alone. The doctor stood from her desk and pulled out an x-ray scan from a manilla envelope.

“Norman, we found a tumor in our tests. It’s a large one, possibly because the last checkup you had with us was over a decade ago, and it went unnoticed. Or, if it’s a cancerous-”

Norman heart began pounding. Cancer. *Cancer*. The word’s meaning made little sense to him, as he never figured it would be a problem to him. He didn’t smoke, or drink, nor did it run in his family. But now, as she described it to him, he couldn’t help but listen through a hollowed shell. 

“We’re going to have to do some more tests, and only then we’ll know for sure. But if this is cancerous… Then I suggest you start making your preparations right away, Norman. Do you have any children?”

Norman had a son, Norman Junior, but he was a young adult now; living on his own with his fiancé. His wife divorced him years ago. All of Norman’s thoughts went towards Norman, his cat. *Who will take care of Norman?*

He'd been able to distract himself with television and crosswords well enough, but today was different. *Just one time* he thought to himself as he glanced up and inadvertently made eye contact with the cashier. *Great* Norman thought, looking back toward the cooler *That didn't help things any*. 

He bent down and grabbed a quart of milk off the second shelf as it was $0.28 cheaper than the equal-sized milk above.
As Norman walked towards the register, he couldn't help but to think of the people he'd seen on tv. *They always seem to get addicted after starting. It's an illness* he shook his head slightly *No, That's just for ratings. They're not going to show the people that aren't addicted. Nobody wants to see that*
Norman tried to clear his head as he set the milk on the counter.

The Cashier rang up the milk and asked "Will that be it?"
Norman glanced to his left..."Yes...No, sorry. I'll also take a Magic 9's scratch-off please". "OK" She replied as she grabbed the ticket and scanned it. "That'll be $2.72" After paying and receiving his change, Norman gave his thanks and headed to his car.

Upon entering his home with great anticipation, very much looking forward to his potentially winning ticket, Norman made a startling discovery. There was a dead mouse on his floor mat. Norman quickly walked into the kitchen, grabbed his broom and dustpan and set his scratch-off on the microwave.

After disposing of the carcass, Norman entered the kitchen once more and headed towards the microwave. He opened the cupboard below and pulled out his yellow pages phone book. As Norman flipped through the book, Norman began brushing up against his leg. *Hold on bud* "I'll feed you after I find an exterminator".] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4oh1hm/norman_kills/] createDate=[1466158595] score=[31] numComments=[2]>

“You. And you, and *you*... have potential.” said Kurt Dupont, a motivational speaker. In front of Dupont was a hundred men and women, all painfully quiet and secretly intimated by Dupont’s charismatic demeanor. Among those nervous people sat Norman.

“Something that no one tells you is that life doesn’t move forward without you. It’s patient, and it’ll wait til you die before your dreams end too.”

Norman fidgeted in his chair, unable to focus on the motivating speech. The chair was too small for Norman; he felt obliged to keep two feet on the ground, to help ease the small chair of his weight. His knees were shaking in the first 10 minutes of the speech.

“Now, you’re all here because you were deemed “too unapproachable” by your upper management. Am I right? Well, we’re going to prove them wrong. Everyone- turn to the person beside you and start a conversation. *Right now.*”

The room echoed momentarily, until Dupont threw in a mocking cricket sound to lighten up the mood. One by one, people started to say “hello” to each other. 

Norman grew nervous. He was on the end of a lane; if the woman beside him didn’t say hello, he would be all on his own for the remainder of the game. Norman knew he couldn’t let the opportunity slip. Quickly, like a well exercised muscle, Norman came up with a plan. He had a water bottle. If Norman loosened the lid just slightly, then precariously placed it on his knee, he could easily create a believable scene-

“Hello.” the woman said. *It worked,* Norman thought.

He carefully picked up the bowl, then stopped. He sat it back down on the counter. He took a small amount in his spoon and tasted it.

“Hm,” he said, placing his hand on his chin. 

He looked down at Norman. Norman purred.

“I think it’s time to branch out a little,” Norman said.

He grabbed his keys and left. He came back 20 minutes later with a shaker of garlic powder. He shook it at Norman and smiled.

He unscrewed the top, peeled off the paper, and added some to his macaroni and cheese.

He sat down on the couch, eager to try his new concoction. He got a spoon full and lifted it to his mouth.

It was cold.

He grunted.

He scraped the macaroni into the trash, and grabbed the garlic shaker. As he threw it into the trashcan he looked down at Norman.

“Oh be quiet,” he said.

</thread><thread title=[Norman Buys a New Car] author=[theycallmechell] text=[Norman left the car dealership with mixed feelings as he drove off the lot. It was his first new car and he got a great deal by trading in his 1996 Ford Taurus for what the salesman kept referring to as a “Smart” car. 

Norman wasn’t entirely sure how the car was smart, but was relieved to be rid of the salesman’s endless – “You’d be making a *smart* choice if you purchase this car” – puns. In spite of his discomforts, the great gas mileage and opportunity to save a little money was really what made Norman feel smart for buying the car. *Up to 40 miles per gallon*, the salesman told him; *even more if you use cruise control*. Norman had never used cruise control before as his old Taurus didn’t have that feature, but he figured he’d give it a try if it meant more mpg’s. 

As Norman got on the freeway he slowly pressed down on the gas pedal and got up to a respectable 60 miles per hour. *I think it’s about time to try out this cruise control*, he thought to himself and pressed his thumb down on the cruise control button. A small green light labeled “CRUISE” popped up on his dashboard, and he cautiously removed his foot from the gas. 

Just then, the brake lights on the car in front of him lit up sending a jolt of fear from his chest to his toes. As he quickly placed his foot on the brake pedal he wondered why he ever thought relinquishing control of his life to a car would be a good idea. The green “CRUISE” light disappeared from Norman’s dashboard, he breathed a sigh of relief, and he safely remained five car lengths behind the car in front of him. 

“Whew, that was close,” Norman muttered to himself. 

He then turned up the radio to clear his mind and started to feel little less “Smart” for buying a new car.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4u6zln/norman_buys_a_new_car/] createDate=[1469281730] score=[32] numComments=[3]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Tries a Break Room Snack] author=[theycallmechell] text=[Grglrglrgrlgrlgrlgrllrgl… 

Norman shifted in his seat as he sat at work hoping nobody heard the reverberating sound that came from his stomach. 

*I shouldn’t have eaten that tuna casserole*, Norman thought to himself. But at the time, his sympathetic nature outweighed his apprehension so he ate it anyway. 

---------------------------

Shelly was new to the company, and decided to break the ice by bringing in her famous tuna casserole for her fellow coworkers. She left the casserole on one of the tables in the break room thinking it would be gone in a matter of minutes. However, to her dismay when she returned an hour later it had hardly been touched. As Shelly began to clean up, Norman entered the break room to fill up his water bottle. 

“Oh, hello. I don’t believe we’ve met. My name is Shelly,” she said with a friendly smile. 

Norman glanced around the break room hoping someone else would be there to return Shelly’s pleasantries without luck. 

“Hello, I’m Norman,” he returned. 

“Nice to meet you, Norman. Would you like some tuna casserole? I made it myself.” 

Norman wasn’t a fan of seafood, and neither was his stomach. He could smell the tuna coming from the casserole and it reminded him of the time he purchased Friskies Tuna Flakes for Norman the cat and nearly threw up when he opened the can. As he considered the best way to politely decline Shelly’s offer he noticed a look of disappointment in her eyes as if she already knew the answer. 

“Sure,” Norman replied pursing his lips to prevent a look of disgust. 

“Oh, great!” Shelly said surprised. Hope you enjoy! Tell me later what you think.”

Norman grabbed a fork and plate, scooped up a small amount of tuna casserole and returned to his desk. *I can just throw it away and she’ll never know*, he thought. But guilt lead him to take a bite he knew he’d regret.

---------------------------

Grglrglrgrlgrlgrlgrllrgl…

Norman’s stomach growled again, sending clear implications this wasn’t going to end well. As Norman reached for the drawer containing the pepto bismol he heard someone approach his desk.

“So what did you think of the casserole?” Shelly asked. 

Norman quickly shut the drawer containing the only remedy to his upset stomach. However, the quick motion allowed the air in his stomach to unleash a silent but deadly escape. *Oh no*, he thought.

“Oh, uh, it was…good” Norman replied. *Please leave, please leave*, he silently begged.

“I’m so glad you liked it. Maybe next week I’ll bring my—What is that?! Do you smell that?!” Shelly scrunched her nose, repulsed by the smell that most clearly was as a fart. 

“No. What smell?” Norman didn’t dare tell the truth of its origin, but guessed that Shelly already knew.

“I’ll, uh… I’ll see you later, Norman.” Shelly said and left in a hurry.

Grglrglrgrlgrlgrlgrllrgl…

Norman clutched his stomach and ran to the bathroom, while Shelly returned to the break room and immediately threw away the remainder of the tuna casserole.

</thread><thread title=[Norman goes to the DMV over lunch] author=[Wintergreene] text=[A distorted voice came across the loud speaker in the corner "Number 87... Now serving Number 87". Norman sighed inwardly as he glanced down at his ticket. "Number 92", he thought to himself. Norman didn't mind waiting in line, in fact he usually rather enjoyed it, but today was different. He hoped his trip to the DMV wouldn't take to long as he was looking forward to seeing Lisa before she went off on her lunch break. She was always so friendly towards him and that made him feel good. 

"Number 87...."  Norman glanced around the room with a curious look. "Just who is 87 and why aren't they getting up", he thought to himself. "I might just miss her today" He let out a long sigh and hung his head down in defeat, but that is when he noticed the small piece of paper stuck under the leg of his chair

His eyes lit up as he pulled the small ticket from the floor; it was number 87. Norman's pulse was racing and he glanced left and right. As always he preferred to sit by himself so no one could have dropped it. This was his chance. If he took the number he could make it back to work sooner then he ever imagined. He might even say something to Lisa today. Norman nodded to himself with new found purpose.  "Last call for Number 87" the voice crackled from the old speaker. 

Norman hurried up to the counter, his voice quavering as he uttered "I'm number 87] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4l7k8y/norman_goes_to_the_dmv_over_lunch/] createDate=[1464326269] score=[33] numComments=[2]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman eats apple (part 2)] author=[wallgreans] text=[Norman had decided to be brave. Or maybe he was just hungry, he couldn't tell the difference. But looking at the luscious apple he had given up on eating all he could think was that maybe the apple had won the battle but it had lost the war. No apple, sticker or no would evade Norman's grumbling stomach and get away with it. Norman picked up the apple and took a huge bite right from the place where he had stuck the sticker. The bite made a loud cracking noise which seemed to echo all around the cramped office.  Indeed, two of his co-workers turned around to see where the sound had come from. Norman was mortified. Already, the sweetness of his victory had turned bitter on his tongue, although admittedly that may have been the taste of the sticker. Norman spit the bite of apple and the partially chewed sticker into his napkin which he placed in the waste basket. Norman again replaced the apple in his lunch box. He knew he should still feel hungry but watching his co-workers work in peace, he felt himself full.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4k00ax/norman_eats_apple_part_2/] createDate=[1463648692] score=[32] numComments=[5]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Struggles with Ketchup] author=[[deleted]] text=[Norman ate the last two green beans from his plate. He was too stuffed to eat the  leftover crusts  from his grilled cheese.  "I'll save them for later," he thought.  "I might want a snack before bedtime."  Norman grabbed the ziplock baggie he had washed and left drying in the dish rack the night before. He threw the crust inside the baggie, squeezed out all of the air, and set it inside the fridge for later that evening.

Norman remembered reading that the best time to go grocery shopping is after dinner between 7 and 8 p.m., after most people settle in for the night.  Norman gleefully thought of having an empty grocery store, all to himself.  Now was also a good time since Norman was full from eating dinner.  It meant he was less likely to make any impulse purchases, like potato chips or tic-tacs.

Norman grabbed the magnetized notepad hanging from the fridge and the "Citizens Bank" pen he kept on the kitchen counter. He made a small scribble on the notepad to get the ink flowing, then started writing out his grocery list:  "Half &amp; Half, toilet paper, bread."

"Ketsup." He stopped and put a line through it.

"Katchup," he tried again.  

He picked his pen up from the paper and brought it to his mouth in thought, but didn't quite put it in his mouth.  Norman thought chewing on pens was unsanitary and probably not good for one's teeth.  Norman scribbled out "katchup" until it was illegible. He shaped the scribbles into a black rectangle so it looked like the word  had been redacted.

"Ketchup," he wrote for the third time.

"Third time's a charm," he said softly to the list. And then let a quick breath of air out through his nostrils, in terse laughter.  Norman had half a mind to start the list over.  But felt it better not to waste another piece of paper.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4dzg73/norman_struggles_with_ketchup/] createDate=[1460194467] score=[34] numComments=[2]>

[Part 8 here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5upbzd/normans_chance_norman_frank_part_89/)
***
Norman hadn’t seen Frank since the start of the previous month. The cubicle became a rather quiet place- albeit it had always been a quiet place. Norman missed saying “Morning” and “Evening” to someone, and while Norman tried his best to make a friendship blossom with the secretary, Norman’s greetings were only met with a cold smile. Norman did not confront Frank about the shouting he heard that one night, or the night after that, or the one after that, before Frank left on vacation leave. In Norman’s defense, it was never as aggressive or violent as the first night; it was slow and dithering fighting, one that Norman supposed exhausted itself after some time.

One night, Norman came home and heard no shouting, no fighting. It was quiet. Norman was relieved that it came to an end on its own without him needing to get involved, but he was left wondering how it came to be. Did Josie leave? Did she take Amber with her? Or did they work it out? Or were they killed and hid in the closet? Were they hid in Norman’s closet? Norman checked his closet,  and learned nothing. He continued to speculate regularly as he rode to work on the public transit, to put in his hours in the small and empty cubicle. The smell of Vietnamese lunches started to dissipate, weeks passed, and Norman’s mind started to become occupied with irrelvant day-to-day problems once again.

Norman walked home from the grocery store one evening, settling on having chicken breasts and rice for dinner. It was his favorite meal- he didn’t know why, it just was- and he was soon daydreaming about if he would rather bread the chicken or have it grilled. Norman waited for the dreadfully slow apartment elevator to arrive. *There are only three floors,* Norman grumbled to himself, as he shifted the plastic shopping bag from one hand to the other, trying to revive his curled fingers from feeling so numb.

The elevator doors opened to reveal Frank, his head hung down, buried into his phone. He would have walked past Norman completely if Norman hadn’t mumbled hello. 

“Hey Norman,” said Frank quietly. “How have you been?” 

“Good, good… How’s your vacation? Did you go anywhere?”

“I thought about it. I have family in Maine I was thinking of visiting…”’ Frank stepped out of the elevator, shifting his way towards the front door of the apartment. “But I changed my mind. Just kicked it here for the time being.”

“Well it’s always good to take a break,” said Norman. Frank nodded.

“When will you be back at work?”

“Not sure, Norman. At least another week. I was thinking I might quit.”

“Oh really?” said Norman. “Yeah, maybe.” said Frank. Frank stepped towards the door. “Anyways, I have to run Norman. Good to see you.”

Frank made his way towards the door, leaving behind Norman with an open mouth.

“Frank,” Norman called out, before the door shut completely. Frank stuck his foot out. Norman hesitated for a moment, unsure if he was about to say something rude- if he wanted to say something rude- or if saying something rude was the only option he had.

“Is everything okay, Frank?” Norman started to blush, feeling as if he’d overstepped a boundary.

Frank shrugged. “No,” he said. He then started to laugh it off, passing it as depraved humor. Norman didn’t join in.

“Well if you want… I have some extra chicken breasts for dinner. If you’d like to join me and my cat Norman tonight…”

“Your cat’s name is Norman?” joked Frank. Norman nodded. “I never knew that.. I never thought to ask, I guess.”

The two of them laughed, and Frank transitioned to hold the door with his hand instead of his foot. “… Sure, Norman. Why not.” Norman nodded to Frank and Frank nodded, back, before Norman nodded one more time and made things uncomfortable. 

“See you, Norman.” Frank said. He stepped out the front door, and Norman called for the elevator one more time, with a warm smile on his face.

</thread><thread title=[Norman forgets his wallet] author=[laskaka] text=[It had happened again to Normans surprise, he’d run out of marmite without him noticing it. He found it very remarkable that he missed it every time the jar was about to be scrapped out, he looked down on his slice of roasted bread with a sigh, “I ought to go buy more so I can go on with this morning.”

Norman threw his toast in the bin and went to his hallway preparing himself with that new brown hat he just bought which fit just right with his old coat. He had a feeling that something was wrong but shrugged it off until he opened the door, “Ah!” Norman said out loud for he’d forgotten to take his umbrella. Not that it was any heavy rain but he wanted to keep his new hat from getting wet. And thus begun the trip to the store.

The bell pinged as Norman entered the store in which he thought himself funny to greet it back by tipping his new brown hat. As he knew the store well he quickly made his way through the narrow aisles to the shelf where marmite jars stood and he was happy to see a full shelf, something which made him think “Maybe I’ll take two!”

Norman hummed a small tune as he made his way to the cashier “Hi, will that be all?”

“I think I’ll take a plastic bag as well”

“Ok, that will be 5,85”

Norman reached for the wallet inside his coat, but wait, it was missing. He patted on his pockets and felt how the face begun to blush and Norman mumbled “I must have forgotten my wallet at home”

“Then you must return the marmite to its shelf” the cashier said with a sigh.

Norman felt very embarrassed when he walked back with the jars filling the empty slots he just made on the shelf. He nodded to the cashier on the way out and in his hurry to leave he struggled with his umbrella allowing some raindrops to fall on his new brown hat. Norman felt very ashamed and hurried home where he just after entering would find his wallet, lying on the small table by the door with the small note by its side *Buy marmite*.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5biup1/norman_forgets_his_wallet/] createDate=[1478504016] score=[29] numComments=[3]>

Norman had forgotten he had set it up last night and was a bit upset with himself for not realizing it was going to be Saturday.  Norman didn’t think there was a reason to make coffee if Norman wasn’t going into work.

“Oh well,” though Norman.  “Might as well start my day.”

Norman was excited because he had planned to purchase Halloween candy today and CVS was having a sale this weekend.  Norman had saved a coupon from Wednesday’s flier too.  Norman got out of bed and disturbed Norman by ruffling the sheets.

At CVS Norman bought two bags of Tootsie Rolls, he had always liked Tootsie Rolls as a child.  When Norman got home he opened both bags and dumped them into a plastic pumpkin he had saved from last year.  There were still two leftover Tootsie Rolls in the bottom.  Norman placed it by the front door while Norman watched from under the table. 

Norman sat in his chair, proud of himself for being prepared two weeks in advance, and turned on televised golf.

"I guess that means I have to get the bus" Norman thought, as he chuckled to himself, the idea of him going on a small adventure around his town got him very excited.
Norman lugged all of his shopping to the nearest bus stop, the thought of sitting on the top floor of the bus with the wind blowing onto his head keeping him motivated to carry his shopping.

He waited for the bus, which was 10 minutes later than expected, Norman eagerly walked to the edge of the pavement and stuck out his hand, unfortunately he stood too close to the edge and the overhanging mirror of the bus bumped Normans head as it slowly parked up.

Norman picked up his shopping and began to walk away from the bus; he couldn't bear to see the disappointment in the bus driver’s eyes, as he had inconvenienced the driver, by changing the angle of the mirror.

"Maybe another time" Norman thought as he went to a phone box to call a taxi.

He ought to be, because they had hired him to do it, but now, with the deadline incoming and the work just a farce of effort and quality, he realised that the only thing he was good at was tricking people into thinking he was good at other things.

"Not a bad talent as far as it goes",  Norman thought, but it certainly wasn't enough to design the prototype for the new Dual Energy Radiography Machine that the company intended to sell to hospitals.

At the end he decided to be honest, he would show the half done calculations and blue prints full of Norman's paw prints, he would tell them the problems he couldn't solve about the prototypes, and how he hoped that more qualified people could solve them, and finally he would show them that he had really tried not to let them down.

And Norman didn't know it, but he always pushed himself too far, those blue prints and calculations full of assumptions were exactly what the board expected, it was just a prototype for God's sake!, and he had worked as if it had to go in production next week, but that was exactly the reason Norman always tricked himself into doing a good job.

Norman slowly opens his eyes and turns to look at the clock. It reads 7:06. Norman sluggishly drags himself out of bed and starts to head towards the bedroom door to begin his morning routine when he notices that Norman is not asleep in bed as he usually is. Norman does find this odd but continues with his morning routine regardless. Norman relives his bladder and heads to the kitchen to get some breakfast – still no sight of Norman.

By this point Norman is becoming agitated, Norman usually always wakes up to the alarm and joins him for 
breakfast.
After about 10 minutes of searching the house Norman leaves to see if he can find Norman outside.
It is a very sunny day and it seems that everyone decided to come out at once. There are joggers sweating, parents with buggy’s and the unfamiliar chime of an ice-cream truck in the distance. Norman feels his stomach grumble, and begins to feel very hungry – he is 20 minutes late for breakfast after all.

Norman decides to abandon his search and head back inside to get some food. Just as Norman gets to the front door he hears a car pull up behind him. He turns to see Norman stepping out of his car with a smile on his face. “bet you are hungry, hey Norman?” Norman purrs and rubs up against Normans legs. “Thought I would get us something special for breakfast this morning buddy” says Norman clutching a plain white carrier bag.
The two head inside to have a very special breakfast of Eggs on toast for Norman and Norman’s favorite gourmet cat food.

Norman had always felt uncomfortable eating around other people, and couldn't stand the thought of someone trying to talk to him whilst he was eating, as he was worried he might chew too loudly and embarrass himself, so he proceeded to find a quiet area to sit and eat his lunch undisturbed. 

Only a few minutes into his lunch Norman noticed Lisa walking in through the door just next to him, and even though he usually quite liked talking to Lisa, He immediately tried his best to avoid eye contact, in order to prevent the dreaded situation he had pictured so recently. "Norman!" He heard, as Lisa hurried over to him, "that looks brilliant! Can I try some?" asked Lisa. Feeling nervous and unsure how to respond Norman hesitantly gave her the middle finger, which swiftly put an end to the situation. "How kind of you Norman" , exclaimed Lisa as she walked off. 

Norman immediately pondered on the situation and  regretted giving Lisa the middle finger, "Why didn't I just say no" Norman quietly mumbled to himself. 

Later that day Norman arrived home at exactly 17:18, slightly later than usual as the bus had been running late, he thought it was best to reward Norman with a treat to apologise for his lateness, as he knew it is always best to maintain strong relationships with those you care about.

"Norman!" He shouted, walking through the front door.

</thread><thread title=[Norman's evening.] author=[lordperiwinkle] text=[Norman sighed heavily.  He was sitting on the bus, very disgruntled. His car was in the shop, so was reduced to commuting by bus.  He had missed the express bus and so was forced to take the slow bus...the one that stops every two blocks and is filled with odd folks.  Finally, after an agonizingly long ride he was able to exit the bus and breathe unused air.  

He walked the several blocks to his home.  As he came close he saw the string of Christmas lights he had hung up shining in the dusk.  And at the window, peering out at him was Norman.  Norman felt a surge of love jolt through him.  He went in and stroked Norman, and kissed him on his furry head.  Norman hung up his jacket and placed his going-to-work shoes in the closet.  Then he laid out on his bed clean navy blue sweats and thick wool socks.  "I have got to get the bus-people pollution off me", he informed Norman.  Norman blinked his calm, green cat eyes at Norman, not understanding but loving the sound of his person's voice.  Norman took a long hot shower, steaming up the bathroom.  He had a new bottle of Dr. Bronner's Peppermint Soap and he inhaled the minty scent deeply.  After his shower he got dressed in his sweats and headed to the kitchen, Norman trailing behind.  

Norman stared in his fridge, considering.  Making a decision he reached for the pack of chicken breasts.  He made a marinade with red wine, basil pesto, and black pepper.  He poured himself a glass of wine and smiled softly as he took a sip. Next, Norman poured a saucer of milk for Norman.  Norman lapped happily at the milk.  

Norman put on a Malcom Watson cd that he had had for many years.  The soothing violin sounds filled the warm kitchen.  Norman sipped at his wine while stirring up a batch of whole wheat muffins and making a green salad.  Finally he sauteed the chicken in his old cast iron skillet.  It had been his Grandmother's and he felt that she would be happy to know her grandson was using the same skillet she had cooked so many good meals in.

His meal finished he and Norman sat side by side at the table.  Norman and Norman both loved chicken.  "Don't worry, Norman", said Norman.  I made the whole pack.  We will enjoy leftovers tomorrow."  

After supper Norman headed to bed.  He had a new Jim Butcher book he was looking forward to.  He snuggled in, glass of wine at hand and Norman snuggling against his full stomach.  Norman turned to the first page, content, and began reading.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5hxme8/normans_evening/] createDate=[1481590004] score=[28] numComments=[20]>

<comment number=[2]author=[lordperiwinkle]text=[Bummer.  I have been reading Norman stuff for quite some time before jumping in.  Now I don't know.  When I read "our Norman" I feel you must mean *your* Norman.  Why the possession of a public figure?   I never knew that reading a pulp paperback fantasy book was sophisticated.  Six days ago MattressCrane wrote that Norman and Norman finished watching the last season of CSI.  (Norman Has a Date)  So why do you want him watching it again so soon?  

Was it the wine?  Would you have preferred it if I had written the wine cost less than $10.00?  I was trying to convey his need to unwind after a trying day.

I picture Norman as an aging everyman,  boring but not dim, with maybe more up his sleeve than meets the eye.  After all, we know he once played keyboard in a band!  And he has a cat.  This alone shows sophistication.

<comment number=[6]author=[lordperiwinkle]text=[But he ALREADY watched all of CSI!!

I am as unsophisticated as can be,  I drink cheap wine and know how to make a basic marinade.  Norman can play the keyboard for crying out loud.  He has a cat. This indicates to me that Norman is a number of steps Up from mouth breathing trailer trash.  Lonely and middle aged, yes.  Hopelessly ignorant, no.  From the posts I studied it I gathered that Norman was trying to not be a total slob, not an ignoramus, just struggling with life.  I feel that Norman is striving for contentment, trying to be at peace with himself, trying to get through life as best he can. 

 I guess I was wrong.  I simply have no interest in writing about some slob who has no finer feelings, no hope or desire to better himself.

<comment number=[7]author=[cakebatter]text=[Don't quit!  Your writing is great.  Like you said no one "owns" Norman, we get to put him into whatever positions we want.  One thing that strikes me as different about your Norman than the way I think about him is that he seems to dislike people a bit more and want to get away from them.  It's a different manifestation of the loneliness I usually see expressed.  I didn't think the details you mentioned seemed off at all.

For my interpretation of Norman, I see a Norman who wants to please people but is afraid of them, someone who feels satisfaction at small little things in his life because he bases expectations on things like politeness and routine.  Your Norman is actually enjoying the things he's enjoying for the things they are, not reflecting on how the routine or safeness feels good; it's an awesome direction to take it, IMO.  It's just a slightly different way to express the same thing we usually see.  It was great!  Don't quit, keep bringing more Norman action our way!]score=[3] </comment>

Don't you dare have Norman do anything different!  Don't stray from the script we have set down in stone!".   I know I was/am too sensitive.  Maybe it was partly because I probably would not comment negatively on someone's post here, or any site that is meant to be a bit creative.  I will gripe some one out on a rl issue but to do so on Life of Norman strikes me as petty.  We are all a bunch of critics these days, just waiting to pounce.  

I wrote too much.  I'm going to try again.  Now.


Norman had had a Rotten Day.  He trudged home from the bus stop, his pits steaming, his spirits low.  When he got to his house he saw Norman's face looking at him through the front window.  "Ahh, Norman!"  smiled Norman.  He unlocked his door, and reached down to scratch Norman's ears.  He took off his shoes, placing them side by side in the closet.  He lumbered into the kitchen and put on  saucepan of water to boil.  Then he headed to the bathroom to take a quick shower.  He used a sample of Axe body wash that had come in the mail.  After his shower he dressed in his old grey sweats.  The water was boiling so he dumped in two packets of ramen noodles.  During the three minute boiling time required he poured kibble into Norman's dish.  He grabbed the pot with a kitchen towel and headed to his living room.  He was just in time to watch CSI SVU.  The show made him squeamish, and gave him bad dreams but he had seen each episode repeatedly and they felt like old friends to him.  Not that Norman had many friends.  He had watched Scrubs, once but the one doctor calling the other doctor girl names weirded Norman out so he had not watched any more.  

Norman thought of adding something to his chicken flavored ramen noodles.  He had seen an article about enhanced ramen.  It had said to add an egg, or veggies, or Sriracha sauce.  "Too fancy", sighed Norman.

Norman set the pot of ramen on the TV tray by his recliner.  Norman hopped on his lap.  Norman popped the top on a can of Coors and settled in for his night of watching fictional cops capture fictional perverts.

</thread><thread title=[Norman has a brilliant idea] author=[phoebeknight] text=[The red-circled date on the wall calendar caught Norman's attention. He'd been on his way to the refrigerator to claim his morning cup of juice when he spotted the reminder. It was the 15th, bill paying day
.

Norman preferred to spend Saturday mornings in his bathrobe, watching reruns from the 50s while his cat vibrated softly in his lap. Norman dismissed the duty as a Monday task and managed to sit through half an episode of Patty Duke before nagging guilt made further procrastination impossible.


He retrieved his checkbook from his desk drawer and placed it beside the neat pile of bills on his kitchen table. After he sealed each envelope, Norman realized he'd forgotten an important detail: stamps.


Norman ransacked his desk with the fury of an elderly barbarian before accepting the devastating truth. He had no choice but to abandon his Saturday routine, put on pants, and go out. As an added indignity, his desk was now somewhat messy.


While choosing between slacks and the risky-but-satisfying freedom of jeans, Norman muttered. It was inconvenient to go out to buy stamps. They're a paper product, they should be available to anyone at any time. In fact, they should be printable. Foreign excitement flooded Norman. Stamps SHOULD be printable. It was a genius idea.


Norman pulled the slacks from his closet since he may see someone he knew at the store. It wouldn’t do to be seen in jeans. As he dressed, he imagined the potential for his concept. He could make millions and finally earn the respect he’d believed he always deserved. To complement the slacks, Norman slipped on a collared shirt and tie. The would better suit his new persona. Rich Norman. Successful Norman. Before leaving, he paused at his computer to see if anyone else already had the notion before him.


He typed Google into the Yahoo search engine, then from Google's site he searched for printable stamps. He stared at the results. Norman wasn't sure which disappointed him more, that someone had marketed the idea long before it blossomed in his own mind, or that he'd put on a tie unnecessarily. He sighed. At least he didn’t have to go out. Norman undressed while his printer slowly hummed out the stamps.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4pntug/norman_has_a_brilliant_idea/] createDate=[1466815171] score=[27] numComments=[0]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Gives it a Shot] author=[dck42069dck] text=[   Norman felt on top of the world. It was a beautiful Sunday afternoon and he had wisely chosen to spend extra time on  Saturday completing the entire weekends' chores. The day was his to spend as he desired.

   He proudly sat back in his lawn chair and took a big sip of his iced tea, careful to not spill any on his light-brown polo shirt. As he contemplated the evening's entertainment, a not-so-easy decision between a new period drama he had rented and the season premiere of a new talent show on Fox, Norman's attention was taken by the host on the radio. "...24-4545. Again, be the 9th caller at 424-4545 to win."

   *Huh* he thought. "Why not?". The way things had been going for Norman recently, he figured he had as good a chance to win as anyone. He quickly sat up and reached for his phone, dialing the number as he'd remembered...Busy. *One more try* he thought as he hung up and redialed. It was ringing..."94.5 The Golden Eagle" answered a young female voice. "Uh, yeah I'm calling about the uh.., am I the 9th caller" Norman suddenly felt very foolish for not even knowing what he was trying win. "I'm sorry, you're too late" she replied, quickly hanging up.

   For a moment, Norman was slightly upset and on the verge of going back inside when a thought occurred to him. 
*I'm such a goof* he smiled *That new Fox show is on tomorrow night*. He sat back in his chair and took a smaller

</thread><thread title=[Norman gets a massage] author=[ForbiddenFruit420] text=[During Norman's last visit to the chiropractor, Dr. Egglestein referred him to get a massage. Apparently, Norman needed to relax more but the idea of getting a massage from anyone other than Norman was terrifying. Norman enjoyed when he and Norman would cuddle up together and Norman would start to purr and knead his thigh with his paws. This is the closest Norman had ever come to a massage. So, here he was, in the waiting room not sure what to expect. When he heard a voice over the new age music saying "Norman?" 

It was a man with a Russian accent who looked like a body builder, wearing scrubs. Norman wanted to run away but instead he followed Dr. Egglestein's orders. The man said "Hello, Norman, my name is Boris. and I'll be your massage therapist today." He had a firm handshake and a welcoming smile. Which made Norman slightly more comfortable until ... He took Norman into a room with dim lights, scented candles and whale sounds with ocean waves playing from an ipod. Then much to Norman's surprise, Boris asked him to get undressed and lie face down on the table. Boris stepped out and Norman was alone in this unfamiliar room getting undressed. But, HOW undressed should he get? He was too nervous to ask. So, he gets down to his tidy whities and decides to leave them on. After all, this is a first visit. He lies face down between the sheets with his face in this little toilet seat looking pillow. Boris knocks on the door and Norman answers "Come in" even though he didn't mean it. Boris put his warm hands on Norman's back and for the first time Norman took a deep breath and started to relax. As he exhaled slowly he felt himself drifting away. Within 2 minutes, he was snoring. 50 minutes later, Boris gently nudges Norman out of a dream and tells him he's all finished. "Get up slowly and come out when you're dressed." Realizing he is no longer in French Morocco, Norman rubs his eyes and gets up. Norman dresses himself and floats out of the room. Boris is standing there with a little paper cup of water for Norman. He tells him to stay hydrated and come back next week. Norman thanks Boris but wonders if he can ask for a female massage therapist next time... ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5tctq1/norman_gets_a_massage/] createDate=[1486827471] score=[29] numComments=[0]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman goes to the movies] author=[ComicalGamer] text=[Norman had just returned from work on a Friday evening and was wondering what he should do for the rest of the day. As he put his things away and sat in bed he thought back to earlier in the morning when his co-worker Janice was saying how much fun she had had at the movies with her friends last weekend, and he thought maybe he would enjoy a nice trip to the movies.

He quickly got dressed in some nice evening attire, gave Norman his food for the night, grabbed his car keys and headed off for a night at the movies. When he reached the theater the parking lot was packed but he was able to find a spot relatively close by. After he parked, he got out, locked his door with the key, turned on the alarm and made his way to the inside of the theater.

As Normin stood in line, he was looking at all the movie posters lining the walls of the theater and trying to decide which movie he should watch. He eventually settled on a romantic comedy starring Steve Carrell and Jennifer Aniston. 

After purchasing his ticket, he made his way to the concession stand where he decided to buy a medium popcorn and medium drink to enjoy as he viewed the movie. 'Oh boy,' Norman thought worriedly as he was leaving the concession stand and making his way to his movie, 'having only popcorn and soda for dinner will be terrible for my cholesterol.' 'I should eat some of my leftover tuna salad when I get home. Wouldn't want it to spoil either.' And after that thought, he found himself in the movie room, where he quickly chose a seat in the lower middle and prepared for a night of love and laughs.

Later that night, he re-heated his tuna salad and ate in his bed as he watched CSI with Norman and waited until it was time to sleep.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5re5bl/norman_goes_to_the_movies/] createDate=[1485962306] score=[26] numComments=[3]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman rips his pants] author=[cluebrayon] text=[Norman arrived home from work and hastened towards the door. He had stopped off at the store on the way home to purchase some cereal. Norman typically does his grocery shopping on a Sunday as to avoid this sort of rushed job, as he likes to peruse the fruit and vegetable section and see what new produce has been packed on the shelves. Last Sunday Norman had bought a mango. This particular day though, Norman had had a double serving of cereal for his breakfast as there was not enough left in the cereal box for another serving. "What a lovely, unexpected treat", Norman quirked at Norman, "but this means I will have to make a quick dash to the store after work to refill". 

Traffic was busier than usual on the way home. He had missed the peak traffic hour coming home from work thanks to his trip to the store, so he wondered why it was still just as busy. Norman peered at the digital clock on his radio dashboard, he made sure it was a quick glance, as to not hold up traffic in case there was a sudden burst of movement. '18:30' the clock read. 'CSI begins at 19:00', he thought to himself. Beads of sweat started to gather in his palms. He wiped his hands on his shirt quickly, before placing them both back on the steering wheel. The traffic started moving.

As Norman opened his front door and manoeuvred himself, his work bag and his shopping bag into the hallway, his belt loop became entangled on the doorknob. Norman had not noticed as he was too concerned with maintaining the integrity of the cereal box wedged in between himself and his work bag. It was too late anyway, the belt loop had snapped and released him. 

"Oh fiddlebumps - what a nightmare", Norman sighed. He had not thought to replace the sewing material his ex-wife had taken with her after she left, and now it had come back to bite him. 

After getting himself settled, he put on some long pyjama pants and turned on the television. It was the first segment of adverts during his CSI episode. He had already seen this one plenty of times so he did not mind missing the first 8 minutes. An advert popped up on screen advertising a new online clothing store. 'For the every day man, at an every day price', read the tagline. He decided to load up this website on his Dell laptop whilst waiting for CSI to return. He browsed the different categories until he found the section labelled 'Trousers'. There were some filters down the side to help him find something catered exactly for him. He chose the following filters, 'workwear', 'beige', 'neutral', 'N/A', 'medium'. It returned exactly 1 result. Realising his time was running out until CSI returned, he clicked on the trousers' thumbnail, quickly browsed through the model photos, before deciding that they were perfectly suitable, and at an 'every day price' too. He checked them out to his basket, input his debit card details and confirmed the purchase. Norman had received free next day delivery too as it was his first order. The CSI theme music played. Norman was happy.

Halfway through his day at work, Norman yawned.

"Oh no, don't start doing that now!" Lisa joked.  Norman almost chuckled. 

"Yeah, I know."

"Had a rough night?"

"You could say that," Norman lied. Lisa laughed again, and Norman let out a rare smile that she didn’t notice.  Norman didn't have a rough night. Norman had gotten eight hours of restful sleep. He was always a little tired.  Instead of driving a route he was just working in the post office for the day.  Norman was perched over the counter, welcoming any customer that stopped by.  Weekly the hours passed as Norman fitted packages and sold stamps.  Whenever the bell rang Norman was trained to meet the customer’s eyes first.  Presently, the open door framed an elderly man.  He was a balding, whiskered fellow wearing a pack of cigarettes in his front pocket, only carrying a weak smile.  The worn baseball cap struck Norman’s memory.  “Armstrong, Will.  3502 Northside Drive,” Norman thought.

“Found any work yet Bill?” What was left of Bill’s smile disappeared as he looked down at the skinny 30 something year old.
 
“I’ve been looking for 5 months now, I’d say,”  This took Norman off guard, making his words take their time on the way out.

“S-sorry to hear that,”  Norman tried to sound disappointed yet hopeful for Bill’s sake.  “What’s kept you busy then?”

“Walking mostly.”  Without another word Norman sold 3502 Northside Drive some stamps, searching hard for anything cheery he remembered from the last encounter he’d had with the smoky fellow. Norman couldn’t think of anything.

“Well have a good one!”

“Uh-huh,”  grunted the old man.  The door tripped the bell on his way out, ringing in the sad, still silence.  Norman hoped that everyone at the office sympathized with his best efforts but, every head was bent down and away, all pretending not to notice.  Regardless, Norman couldn’t shake the thought of Bill out walking aimlessly, feeling unwanted.

At 3pm, Norman and a few others, including Lisa, stopped for a short break.  Lisa was young. She seemed to be of college-age (although Norman could only guess). Norman himself wasn’t old yet, but he didn’t feel that way around Lisa.  She was new enough to the office to ask daily where to find things.  She stood out in the office most, at least to Norman. Suddenly sitting up in the break room, turning to him as if to ask a question.
“So Norman what did you for the weekend? See your family with the time off?”  Norman was taken back.
	“Yes.” he said, eventually. “We had a great time.”  Norman lied.
	“Well what d’you do for fun around here?”
	“We… went to a baseball game”  Norman had always wanted to.
  	“How fun!”  Norman nodded, rubbing his cheek uncomfortably.  

The manager, Mike, took notice of Norman.  And like a good host, he always tried to help things go smoothly.  He tempted Norman to smile at a joke about the weather, but Norman didn’t move, thinking of Bill, stuck without work. 

 Finally the day was nearing it’s end when the bell tolled one final time.   Norman recognized the guest right away.  An elderly woman; “Bridgers, Marilyn 710 West Walnut Street”.  710 West Walnut Street had short gray hair that curled in all directions.  Eyes that were once sharp squinted behind faded glasses on her wrinkled face.  She seemed tired, not from fatigue, but simply worn, like Norman felt.

“How are you today?” Norman inquired.  He recalled a distant memory of 710 West Walnut Street loving to get those letters from her grandkids.  “Heard much from the grandkids lately?”

“I’m sure they’re fine, but they haven’t written in a few years now.”  Norman could hardly speak when he heard this. Regret slowly started to gnaw at him for prying in with such a senseless question.

  “I’ll just take some more stamps, thank you.”

“I’m sorry ma’am.”   Norman pulled out the sheet of flowered paper. “Is that all I can help you with today?”

“Just that would be lovely, thank you.”   She left him feeling cold.  Norman knew that cold, and wondered if she felt it too. Norman didn’t speak again until he got home. 


“I have to do something for her.”  Norman said to himself.  He paced through the living room, which was darkened by a thick black curtain that spread across the only front window.   “But she’s not going listen to a word I say!  Should I just send her cookies? Flowers?”  Norman asked all this to his friend, Leon, wondering if flowers would even be appropriate.  Norman had never given gifts like these before.  Leon watched intently as Norman set the short table for dinner.  Norman did so inaccurately, arguing aloud with himself while he trickled cheese onto the spaghetti.   “What do I even say to her?  She doesn’t care about me or know me at all,”  thought norman. The cooling spaghetti meant that dinner was over. Leaning back in his chair, Norman looked down. Leon was sleeping curled under the lamplight, the sight of which helped to calm him. Norman thought he shouldn’t worry either, since Leon wasn’t worried, even if Leon was a cat. 

The next day was Tuesday, and Norman was walking as usual to his building. Norman saw Lisa walking across the parking lot.  He also noticed that their paces were the same and would reach the door at the same time. Norman slowed down. 
Through the day, Norman was particularly distracted.  He managed to avoid Lisa by working through the breaks and looking down and away, trying to look focused on his dull work. Norman fought with himself all this time, deciding if he would reach out to to Mrs. Bridgers that evening.  When finally it was closing time, Norman had settled on writing her a card. He printed out something that could pass for a card on the office printer.  Standing up, he tucked his seat back under the desk.  Norman walked a little too quickly through the halls.  He passed Lisa’s concerned look on his way to the exit.

“Norman?” Her voice rose a little higher than normal. He stopped and looked back over his shoulder, not letting go of the door’s handle. “Where are you rushing off to so quickly?” 

“I have to go.”  Norman didn’t wait to find out if Lisa had more to say, as Lisa’s response was lost in the slam of the door.
Norman couldn’t get Lisa off his mind as he drove.  Having driven this route a countless number of times before, Norman had no trouble finding 710 West Walnut Street amongst the winding streets in the wooded neighborhoods.  Norman parked a few houses before Mrs. Bridger’s.  It gave Norman time. Norman wanted to turn back and go home, but against his own will Norman’s hand descended on the card.  It was gray, with a silver flower on the front that he didn’t know the name of.  He walked meekly up to the single story home.  Norman rang the doorbell.  The buzz summoned a voice from the house. The voice was faint but came quickly.  The door opening revealed an elderly women with hair that curled in all directions.  

“Good evening! How’re you today!”

“I’m fine.” 

“Aren’t you my mailman, Mr-”

“Just call me Norman.”  Norman cut in, surprised at how his own confidence.

“Norman! Well how can I help *you* today?”  
 
“I just came to deliver some mail,”  Norman looked down at the modestly colored card, “from me. I know you haven’t seen any letters from your grandkids a time now.”

“How nice of you to do!  But I wouldn’t count it against them,” She dismissed. “You can hardly blame them, they’re all grown now,”  she sighed.  It wasn’t a sad or even lonely sigh, but one with a hint of a smile.  A lump in Norman's throat started to tug as he stared.

“You don’t, miss them then?”  

“Well of course I miss them,” she laughed “but they have lives of their own now, and I’m glad for them.  And of course they’ll visit when they can.” Norman nodded, feeling a little stupid holding the door for so long. 
“Thank you very much for the card!”  

“Well I’m happy for you and your family,” Norman said.  “I’d better get going, have a good night.”

The next day was Wednesday, and halfway through he yawned quietly to himself.  This gave him a thought.  Norman peered over her cubicle to look at Lisa. Her hair was curled today.  He stared at his hands pondering this sudden shift, wondering how he felt about the change.
Standing to "walk to the water cooler",  he passed by, confirming that her hair was indeed different.  
When he came back to the front counter with a cup of water, he stopped in front of her's and said, 

"Hey, Lisa."  She turned around and said, 

"Oh hey Norman, how're you?"

"I'm well, thank you. I noticed your hair looks different today." he ventured
Lisa laughed, to Norman’s great alarm.

"Well actually, my hair is always this way naturally. I hate how curly it is, but I was too lazy to straighten it this morning. So it's normal today!"

“Oh” He thought for a moment. A part of Norman fought back, but a less vocal but more intimate voice in his head took control this time,  "I like normal."

Norman stepped through the office back to his desk, amazed by his sudden courageousness. He couldn’t wait to tell Leon about the curls when he returned home.
Looking at herself in the monitor, Lisa smiled.

He chose a sleek modern looking table from Ikea.  After taking the box home he began assembling the table.  Never one to stray from the path, Norman followed the instructions as best he could, but something was wrong.  Once the table was assembled there was an extra piece.  Not just an extra screw or bolt either.  This was a whole piece of wood!  Turning it over and over in his hands Norman gazed at it for a minute.

</thread><thread title=[Norman Takes a Walk, and Sees Something Delightful] author=[SeaFortress] text=[&amp;nbsp; It was a Sunday afternoon, and Norman was flipping through the paper while his cat, Norman, lay curled up by his feet. It was a comfortable day, with a light breeze – the kind of breeze that tickled your face and lifted your spirits. As Norman finished the paper, he decided that he should go for a walk and enjoy the weather. Walking for pleasure wasn’t the type of thing that Norman usually took part in, but today was such a nice day he felt that he had to go out, if only for a bit. 


&amp;nbsp; As he put on his shoes, he debated on whether or not he should bring a jacket – suppose he didn’t bring one, and it got a bit cool as he was out? It did seem nice out, and he would be on the move, which would probably keep him warm, but one could never be too careful. Saying a quick goodbye to Norman, he grabbed his lightest jacket, and headed out the door.
 

&amp;nbsp; Norman went to tie the jacket around his waist, but suddenly stopped himself – it dawned on him that it might look a bit silly. He decided on just carrying it over his arm, and went on his way.


&amp;nbsp; As he rounded the block, a car was coming towards him, and on the opposite side of the road, Norman saw something that delighted him (how I wish you could have seen his face light up!)– it was a large squirrel, sitting very still. As the car got closer, the squirrel darted out in front of it, and narrowly missed getting hit. The squirrel ran very close to Norman, then up a tree. It perched itself on a branch, still once more, watching Norman.


&amp;nbsp; What a thing this was to Norman! He felt quite sure that the squirrel, in its own way, knew what it was doing – like it was playing a sort of game. Norman chuckled to himself. 
	

&amp;nbsp; “*Squirrels playing games?*” He thought. “*What an idea!*”
	

&amp;nbsp; The squirrel and Norman watched each other for a moment, until a distant noise broke the spell, and the squirrel ran further up the tree, out of sight.
	

&amp;nbsp; Norman shook his head, smiling, and headed back to his house – that was enough excitement for one day. He couldn’t wait to tell Norman about that remarkable squirrel.

</thread><thread title=[Norman gets angry] author=[PizzaWithKetchup] text=[It was a Tuesday evening. Norman finished work late again as Debra asked him to do the rest of her paperwork as she said she had something important to do.

"What a day..." Norman thought to himself.

As he took the elevator to the main floor, he saw the Coca Cola vending machine that he always walks past each working-day. He never bought anything from it in over 2 years.

Seeing it this time made him remember the Christmas Coca Cola commercials that he saw Sunday evening when he was watching a movie with Norman by his side. 

He took out his wallet, put in a dollar, and pressed the 2nd red Coca Cola button on the machine. It made a noise, but no beverage dropped down!

"What the..." Norman murmured to himself as he was confused. He pressed the button harder and three more times... nothing. 

Norman let out a sigh and gave the machine a pretty hard slap... doing it even startled him as it was louder than he anticipated. 

He made eye contact with the camera watching the halls and immediately felt guilty. He raised his hands to it expressing that he was sorry and was unsure if the security who might be watching it even understood what his apologetic gesture was.

He walked swiftly toward the exit and hoped no one saw his act of frustration, which might have also been considered vandalism!] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5h4mto/norman_gets_angry/] createDate=[1481196361] score=[27] numComments=[1]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman uses public transport.] author=[shortpoppy] text=[Recently, Norman had been made quite aware of his environmental footprint.  Feeling the need to make a change, Norman began using the bus to take him to and from work.

One bus driver in particular, with a name tag of "Rick", began to build up a friendship with Norman.

Rick would drop Norman off, right by his house.  Norman would say thank you and get off the bus, and wave until Rick drove away.

Norman doesn't mind that his house is actually directly in front of the bus stop, and Rick has been dropping him a block and a half away from home.  It is the thought that counts.  Norman is happy that Rick feels he has done his daily act of kindness.  Plus, now Norman gets a bit of exercise into his day as well as shrinking his environmental footprint.

"Bless you," said his cubicle mate. Norman thanked him and kept on with his work. Norman felt a tickle in his throat and coughed again. 

"Bless you," said Nirman's cubicle mate. "I've got some cough drops in the break room." Norman politely declined the offer.

Norman felt the tickle come back to his throat but he held it in. He didn't want to be a bother. The urge to cough grew stronger. Norman felt his eyes water. Then suddenly he pictured the water cooler. Norman tried not to appear in too much of a rush down the hall. Norman allowed himself a quiet cough after a cool drink.

</thread><thread title=[Norman At The Light] author=[ligamentary] text=[Norman was en route to a dinner party across town and was making pretty good time. Unfortunately as he sailed down the surface streets, he was stopped for a red light at the juncture of Creamer Street and Horncrest Avenue. 

He took a sip from his water bottle but recoiled at the  taste. It had been sitting too long and was too warm for drinking. 

He whistled the bars he could remember of "Heal The World." He scratched an itch and stretched his arms. 

"This is quite a light." He thought to himself checking the time. For a split second he considered just transgressing it, as there didn't appear to be any other cars coming. But he knew he didn't want to risk slight chance of bodily injury or the larger chance of a moving violation. 

He smacked his lips. He looked out his sun roof and tried to imagine what the clouds looked like. "That's maybe... a blob of lotion. And then it's neighbor is a sort of rocking horse..." He swatted at a bug on his thigh and decided to roll his windows up as twilight approached and mosquitoes along with it. 

Just as he was doing so, the light turned green, and Norman proceeded on with his trip. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/55ylxo/norman_at_the_light/] createDate=[1475687368] score=[25] numComments=[0]>

</thread><thread title=[The Fourth of Norman] author=[Castriff] text=[There was a special place in Norman's heart for the Fourth of July. Every year, the office rented space at the city park to hold a picnic. It was quite the celebratory affair. Everyone in the building came out in their best casual clothing, laid out red-white-and-blue blankets and towels out on the grass, ate hotdogs, and played rousing games of volleyball out on the sand courts.

Norman's part in the festivities was simple. He was to bring the potato salad. It was a simple job, but Norman took pride in his work, using an old family recipe which he'd first learned at the tender young age of thirteen. "The secret," his mother had told him, "is that each new generation adds an ingredient they think will go best with the current taste." His mother's sister, being the older of the two, had added a dash of lemon juice. Norman had deliberated for some time before settling on classic Dijon mustard. Norman's mother had taken one bite and declared it was the best potato salad she had ever eaten.

That Monday, Norman arose at 9 AM and went about his morning routine. Instead of putting on his work slacks and a dress shirt, however, Norman opted to wear jeans and a simple Hawaiian shirt decorated with pictures of tiny palm trees. He briefly debated whether or not he wanted to wear sandals or tennis shoes, then decided to compromise. *Socks and sandals it is,* he mused.

Norman mewed happily as Norman entered the kitchen. "Happy Fourth of July, Norman!" Norman greeted his cat. He opened the fridge to check on the already-finished potato salad chilling in the crisper and retrieve some bread and jam for his breakfast. Then he went to the pantry to get a can of tuna to add to Norman's dish. He scooped the tuna out over Norman's regular kibble, and let Norman dig in.

Norman left the house at 10 with the potato salad tucked safely in a patriotic-looking cooler, surrounded with several bags worth of ice. The radio played a big-band rendition of "The Star-Spangled Banner" halfway through the trip. Norman tapped his fingers on the steering wheel the whole way through the song.

Lisa was in charge of the picnic food, as she was nearly every year. Once Norman arrived at the park, she directed him to the pavilion and had him set down the cooler on a picnic table.

"There it is," she said, lifting the Tupperware containers out of the cooler. "Norman's World Famous Potato Salad!"

Norman blushed. "I'm glad you like it."

"Norman, could you do me a huge favor? We don't have enough lemonade, and I need someone to buy some more. Could you do that?" Norman accepted. It took him three tries, but he finally found a convenience store that wasn't closed and used his company card to buy five more gallons of lemonade. By the time he returned, it was time to eat.

Norman spent the afternoon watching his coworkers play volleyball and fielding comments about the "superior quality" of his potato salad. He thanked them for the kind words, but politely declined to give anyone the recipe. Around three, Norman received a text message from his son:

&gt; Hey dad, just wanted to say thanks for emailing me the potato salad recipe. My friends love it. I decided to add some bacon bits to the recipe though, I hope you don't mind. Maybe next year I'll come down and you can make it your way. Happy Fourth. TTYL

Below was a picture of Norman Jr. and his girlfriend on the beach. Norman chuckled to himself and sent a reply.

&gt;Bacon bits on potato salad sounds perfect. 

He watched the fireworks that evening with pride in both his country and his son.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4r5t6y/the_fourth_of_norman/] createDate=[1467640241] score=[24] numComments=[5]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman goes to a museum: the prequel] author=[xain1112] text=[Norman waited patiently outside the new Medieval History Museum that had just opened up in his city.  He had received a pamphlet in the daily paper several days earlier.  He was almost shaking with excitement at being one of the first 100 people in the museum and getting a commemorative pin.

When the museum finally opened at promptly 9 a.m.—Norman admired them for their punctuality—he walked up to the ticket counter and asked for one adult ticket.  The young lady at the desk asked how much he would like to donate.  It was then that Norman realized that, like other museums he had been to, this one had a pay-what-you-want pricing system.

Norman was about to say one dollar so he would have enough money left over to buy some groceries for dinner, but he began to feel guilty.  He knew that other museums charged $10 per person, and he didn't want to play favoritism.

Norman handed the woman a crisp $10 bill, and she handed him his ticket, pin, and a map of the museum.

"Enjoy your visit," she said to him.

Claire stopped by her hotel room first to change into a flowery dress before her and Norman went out to find coffee, and Norman, always prepared, changed his pair of socks with a fresh pair he was keeping in his pocket. Won’t be getting sweaty feet today, Norman thought to himself. 

The two stood on the corner outside of the hotel before realizing they were lost to being able to find a coffee shop. They didn’t know where to start. “Why don’t you ask someone for directions?” Claire told Norman.

Norman huffed in nervousness. Do they speak English here? Norman thought. He didn’t know. Hawaii itself is a very peculiar word, and Norman pegged it as slightly portuguese. Norman doesn’t speak portuguese. A tanned man in  a cab pulled up in front of them.

“Ola,” said Norman.

“E hele pūʻoe me aʻu.” said the taxi driver.

Norman nodded to the man, then nodded to Claire. Claire nodded to the driver. 

“Hu!” shouted the driver. The two of them quickly entered the vehicle. He drove them much farther than they anticipated; no longer were they in the vicinity of the hotel, but now they were in a much more rugged part of town. It was rugged in a handsome way, and the driver pulled over in front of a restaurant with no signs. 

“Thank you!” Norman and Claire shouted. Norman didn’t see how much the fare was, and the driver didn’t say a price either. Norman put 20 dollars in his hand and stepped out on the street and into the restaurant. 

It was a quaint and quiet place, with only a few tables occupied, and only a few tables cleaned off from the last customers. Norman and Claire took a seat, when momentarily later a large Hawaiian man approached the table. He carried two thin parchments of menu and placed it in front of them before solemnly returning to the kitchen. 

“Do you do things like this often, Norman?” asked Claire. Norman desperately wanted to say yes.

“Not often at all, really.”

“Me neither.” Claire admitted in a whisper. She smiled, and kicked Norman’s leg from under the table.

</thread><thread title=[Norman eats Italian] author=[HieronymusK] text=[It had been a long Friday. Norman had been working overtime because he was stuck in traffic during his morning commute, making him at least 15 minutes late. To compensate he had his lunch at his desk, and left a bit later than normal.

After leaving the office he first he went by the grocery store. Norman had been thinking about making spaghetti all day. He admitted to himself that he's not a great chef, but he was confident about his spaghetti because he has a good (but simple and cheap) recipe.

After getting most of the ingredients, the grated cheese posed the first problem. The first two packages were to expire this very day. Seeing as this had been a particularly long day, the cheese would spoil in only a few hours. Feeling a little bit flustered about cheating the whole "first in, first out" system, Norman looked around to see if any employees were around, and quickly took the third package.

But the real problem arose in the sauces isle. His favorite brand spaghetti sauce, "Signora Bernini", was sold out. Norman stood around, pondering about the many other brands. "Which sauce is most like the one I always get?", he wondered. After a while the multitude of choices overwhelmed him, making him regret his decision to make spaghetti this day. He quietly put back all the ingredients, making sure to put the cheese back third in the shelve. He made his way to the microwave meals fridge and took out his favorite lasagna. 

As he walked to the cash register he said to him self, "Well, it's still Italian". Saving his cooking plans for another day.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4bx6mc/norman_eats_italian/] createDate=[1458952218] score=[26] numComments=[2]>

As the evening wound down he realized he felt a bit light headed, and may have inadvertently had too much to drink. He'd driven his car and brought two other people with him. He didn't want to strand them. He considered just drinking some water and waiting it out, but didn't want to overstay his welcome. 

Sheepishly he told the friends he'd driven there that he felt he'd had a bit too much wasn't comfortable driving, asked if they'd drive him home, and offered to order them a car service to their place from there. They agreed. 

As they hurried out of the frosty air and into the heated Saab, Norman apologized for the inconvenience.

As he passed by the apartments south of his apartment complex a small bird flew over his head and landed on a the branch of a tree growing beside the sidewalk. His first thought was, I bet Norman would like to chase that bird. But then he continued walking past and the bird did not move. He really looked at it, and it looked back at him, shifting its head to the side as small birds sometimes do to get a better look. Norman shifted his head too. He felt friendly with the bird, and admired the ways it's feathers seemed to change from green to blue as his angle changed. He said, "Hi bird." and it flew off. Then, just as suddenly, a yellow butterfly flitted across his vision. It fluttered and flapped, then seemed to soar for a bit. I wonder why they call them butter-fly's, Norman thought. His thought continued, I would like to flit and soar like that. Also, I'd like some butter.

Norman aspired one day to be one of the people who sat idly in the corner and drew pictures during the work hours. However, with his half hour lunch breaks, Norman’s goal was to buy the right kind of coffee in the shortest amount of time.

Norman preferred dark roast coffee. There was nothing wrong with medium. He wouldn’t judge someone if they wanted the medium, or if medium was all they had left. But Norman liked dark roast. Problem was, the barista with the spacers in her ears couldn’t seem to tell the difference.

Norman was tired of getting medium medium coffee’s when he explicitly asks for dark roast every time. He could correct her, but coming off as rude and hurting the girl’s feelings didn’t feel a worthy trade to him. He sighed as he approached the counter. The barista smiled, and it made Norman sad.

“Hello, how’s your day?” asked the barista with one headphone in her ear.

“Good good, can I order a *dark roast*,” Norman paused for emphasis, “medium coffee please?”

“Medium medium is 2.25, please.”

Norman stood still, imagining that the espresso steam whistle was coming from his ears. He paid, he poured sugar, and he left.

Norman tried to look smooth by tossing his bag of chips into the garbage can while telling Lisa about the new episode.

*"Oh yeah I did Lisa, do you want me to tell you about it?"*

*"Uh, if you could excuse me Lisa I gotta go wash my hands and get back to work"* Norman said.

As a mutiny among the workers grew, Norman's boss decided it would be best to give everyone Friday off while an exterminator would be called to deal with the situation.

Norman listened on as his coworkers talked about their fun plans they had set for the long weekend. Robert was going fishing. Frank was solemn and planned on drinking earlier in the afternoon. Eleanor was planning a picnic with her grandchildren. Norman had planned... Nothing.

It's been awhile since Norman had a free Friday. Norman thought back to last Friday, trying to remember what he had planned. He couldn't remember. Nor the Friday before that. Norman couldn't recall any Friday's, as nothing notable ever occurred. Norman then felt rather pleased by this- he knew that nothing tomorrow would make him feel nervous, or put him a situation where he had to make conversation with someone off the top of his head. He would do nothing.

Norman looked forward to his nothing, and then come Saturday morning, Norman was glad for his ability to tell the future.

Carefully going over the spacecraft's systems, Norman dilligently filled out the diagnostic form, noting fuel levels, signal qualities, and air supplies. Despite the need to preserve the latter, he allowed himself a deep sigh; he was to have a little fun, after all.

Not the sort of fun his teammates were  having down on the surface, of course. That was much too much. *Not my cup of tea,* Norman mused, as he closed the blinds to his small, circular window. The auroras streaking over the pearlescent globe beneath were distracting him from his important tasks. *Seven more boxes checked and I'll be onto page three*.

Just as Norman turned the page, his head was jolted forward - he almost hit his head on the metal panel of the seat rest in front of him!  Such a violent brake pulled him right out of his daydream. *Just as well,* he reasoned, *the bus driver must have avoided quite the hazard*.

The thought of having a meal at the improper time of the day excited Norman; it made him feel rebellious and adventerous. Norman had a slight skip in his step as he walked into the kitchen and towards the cabinet. The anticipation was building. He didn't waste time picking a cereal, as he ate the same one all the time. He grabbed his favorite bowl, the one with the horseshoe accents, and considered pouring the milk first, to be extra rebellious. Norman chuckled at his thought and shook his head as he proceeded to pour his cereal into the bowl. He walked to the fridge and grabbed the milk. He took off the cap&amp; poured it in, careful as not to pour too much in- the last thing he wanted was soggy cereal. Norman walked back to the couch and sat down with his bowl of cereal. As he lifted the spoon to his mouth, he smelled a strange smell. But he was so excited to eat his cereal, he dismissed the thought as an outdoor odor creeping in from his open window. Norman sat on his couch pleased after he finished his bowl of cereal. How fulfilling it was to be a rule breaker and eat breakfast in the evening.

</thread><thread title=[Norman Tries Something New] author=[VivianCadence] text=[The air was filled with the joy of the loveliest spring afternoon, and Norman had an especially confident bounce in his step. Normanly he wasn't such a fan of going to the grocery store in the middle of the day because, presumably, everyone else would be there, too, it seemed... But today he decided to give it a chance. "It really could be a lovely experience, and maybe kind of fun and social!!" he thought while fighting the urge to squirm from secret excitement. "How delightful!" 

 All in all, the visit to the store was pleasant and fair. While Norman was standing in line at the checkout, the woman in front of him was arguing with the cashier, and he didn't want to eavesdrop but he couldn't help but hear the conversation, mostly because the woman was kind of shouting everything she said. In fact, Norman found that she was being quite rude to the small, feeble cashier who looked to be in her 90s or so. He decided to speak up, saying that maybe it would help her case if she calmed down a bit and was a little more gracious to this cashier. The woman simply looked back at him with what he instantly thought was probably the angriest expression he had ever seen any one person make, and then after his briefly and meekly thinking nothing on the planet but the word "gosh," she said "Did I ask you? Did anybody here ask for your opinion? Hm?"

Norman scratched his head, suddenly feeling really terrible. No, nobody had asked him. "She does have a point," he thought as he ceded his possible social triumph to guilt. With his head down for his entire walk home, Norman thought for a while and decided he probably just shouldn't have gone to the grocery store after all.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4gmvcn/norman_tries_something_new/] createDate=[1461759678] score=[25] numComments=[3]>

</thread><thread title=[Direct Deposit] author=[sophrocynic] text=[It was twenty minutes past two, Wednesday afternoon. However, the clock on Norman’s microwave read 3:05 as he walked past it on his way out of the apartment. Norman was trying to work on his time management, and so he had set his microwave clock fast on purpose to remind him what time it would be when he finished his morning commute. Norman waved goodbye to Norman, who ignored him. 

Norman was taking one of his vacation days today. He was always forgetting how much leave he had accrued, and it had come as a shock that he was in danger of losing some of his PTO. Norman usually felt just a bit lost on days like these. Norman had in fact spent the morning and most of the early afternoon researching the Aztec empire to help him flesh out his Sherlock fanfiction. But Norman remembered that he had something important to do.

Norman started his Civic and drove down to the office. Norman felt uneasy coming to work when he wasn’t scheduled to be there, but he recited his affirmations to himself and by the time he pulled into the parking lot he felt almost normal. He parked in a different lot than he ususally parked in, and he walked to the entrance nearest the payroll department.

Norman rang the bell for service, and the peroxide blonde secretary in the houndstooth top asked him what he needed. (After Norman left the building, he would, like usual, remember that her name was Alison.) Norman explained that he wanted “one of those, you know, forms, like for the bank. Umm.” 

“Direct Deposit, you mean?”

“Yeah, one of those.”

“Actually, you do that through the employee portal these days. Do you know your bank’s routing number and your account number?”

“Yes,” lied Norman, in an effort to impress her.

“Then you can do that any time you have a moment. Just log on, click “Employees,” then pick the “Financials” tab, and then you go to “Direct Deposit Authorization.”

“I see. Thanks for your help,” said Norman. A phone rang, and the secretary turned back to her desk.

Norman stood there for about five seconds, and then he turned and walked away. Fortunately, his boss or coworkers didn’t catch him at work on his day off, so there weren’t any awkward conversations.

At some point during the drive home, Norman said, “Oh. Alison. That’s right,” and was vaguely frustrated with himself.

When Norman got home, he was greeted by a hungry Norman. Norman opened a can of tuna for Norman, and then sat down at his computer. Sure enough, signing up was quite simple. It was amazing what one could do with computers these days, Norman thought. Now Norman wouldn’t have to drive down to the bank every two weeks, which was nice. Norman spent the rest of the day on his fanfiction. Then Norman watched CSI, had a late supper, and went to sleep early.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4eutzv/direct_deposit/] createDate=[1460718514] score=[24] numComments=[1]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman buys Döner] author=[TurnDownForPage394] text=[One day Norman went to get Chinese food for lunch and his fortune cookie read "It's time for an adventure." 

*Hmm,* thought Norman, *I've always wanted to go to Europe and I have a lot of vacation time built up. I think it's high time for a vacation!*

After work, he went to the library to research places to go. France would be far too expensive in a few months' time and Italy would be too warm. England was too crowded for his taste. But, ah, Germany looked like just the spot! So Norman went about booking his plane ticket, hotel, etc.  

On the big day, Norman dropped off Norman the cat at his son's house and drove to the airport. The flight was long, but not unbearable, and as soon as he knew it, he was touching ground in Berlin. 

By the time he'd set his bags down and had a shower at the hotel, it was dinner time and he was growing hungry. He had noticed some food stands on the same block as the hotel and decided he would try out one of those. 

The very first one sold pizza. No, he thought, pizza was no good. He could get pizza in the United States. The second one said "Eis" on it: too many vowels-- too foreign. The third one said "Döner". Hey, he had heard about Döner in the travel guide! He decided he might have that. 

"Gooten tag" he said to the old, Turkish-looking woman manning the food stand, hardly looking up from his phrase book. "Ick sprecke kein Deutch. Ick bin American. "Sprickst doo English?"

The old lady laughed and shook her head. "No English." 

"Can I have one?" Norman held up one finger. The old woman seemed to know what he wanted and began preparing his meal. 

"Mit Pommes?" she asked. He shrugged and nodded while she piled some French fries onto the plate. He didn't like French fries, but he didn't really know what she'd asked. "Sechs Euro fünfzig," she said, sliding the paper plate across the stand. 

He tossed a 10€ bill at her and left without waiting to see if it was enough. The Döner was growing cold by the time he reached his room, but it was still pretty good. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/60kaa1/norman_buys_döner/] createDate=[1490083440] score=[48] numComments=[12]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman burns his house down] author=[sneekysnakes] text=[Norman opened the door to his new house. It had just been built, just for him. It was a modest home, with no more space than was really necessary for one person, with the only exception being a second bedroom. Norman liked the idea of having a place for guests to stay when they came over. Maybe someone from out of town. After all, he was living in a new neighborhood. Maybe someone from work would want to come see his new place and he could offer them a bed to sleep in so they wouldn't have to drive home late. *That would be unsafe,* thought Norman. 

Norman also had a small backyard. It was something he had wanted for a long time. He wanted Norman to be able to go outside and play and maybe chase birds and squirrels; though hopefully not kill them. Norman didn't want to have to clean that up. 

Norman began exploring his new home. The kitchen was quite nice, with a fancier stove and refrigerator than he used to have. He had debated getting a garbage disposal, but that seemed excessive. Norman was more than happy to take the garbage out to the curb himself. He realized that the refrigerator had a water and ice machine on the front. This wasn't something Norman was used to. Maybe he had gone too far with the appliances. After all, they were very expensive, especially on his salary. Norman began to regret the purchase.

Norman looked around for Norman, but he was nowhere to be seen. *He must be in the back yard.* Norman thought to himself. This made Norman happy, until he realized that Norman might start to become an outside cat, and spend less time with him. Norman loved coming home to see Norman excited to see him. Maybe those days were over. 

Norman decided to turn in a little early. He was looking forward to taking a walk around his new neighborhood in the morning and wanted to be well rested. Norman hadn't come inside yet, so Norman left the back door open for him to  come in when he was ready. He was sad to not be sleeping with Norman at the bottom of the bed, but tried to be happy for the fact that Norman was able to go out and explore more. He wondered what Norman was up to.

Norman was woken up by his need to use the restroom. He ran into the bathroom to relieve himself. As he was standing there, he noticed that he was hungry. Norman decided to try out his new kitchen. On his way in, he noticed that Norman was sleeping on the chair in the living room, looking quite comfortable. Norman smiled at this thought as he looked over his breakfast options. He didn't have many different ingredients, and he realized he hadn't purchased a recipe book for his new home. Norman decided to make waffles. 

Norman fired up the stove and began to cook. As he did, he looked over to see if Norman was still asleep. He was. Norman wondered what Norman was dreaming about, and wondered whether or not he would stop going outside and exploring. He missed their old friendship, and Norman didn't seem like his usual, cuddly self.

Suddenly, Norman looked down to see that a fire had started on the stove. He began to panic, looking around for a way to stop the fire. He realized that he had completely forgotten to purchase a fire alarm for the kitchen. *Silly Norman* he thought. *How could you forget that?* 

The fire began to spread all around the kitchen.
Before he knew it, Norman was surrounded by flames. He ran as quickly as he could out of the house onto the sidewalk. He watched as the fire spread into the rest of the house. Through the open roof, he saw Norman escape out the back door. 

Norman turned off his computer monitor. *That wasn't very fun at all.* Norman thought. He had never been one for video games anyway. 

Later that night, as Norman got ready to go to bed, Norman, purring heavily jumped up and nestled himself by Norman's feet. *It's good to have things back to normal* Norman thought to himself. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5rt8ut/norman_burns_his_house_down/] createDate=[1486147435] score=[23] numComments=[1]>

Norman decided to go to a store where he had bought a previous one. A change of his Saturday routine mildly excited him. In the store, he went straight to "men" section, where he found a previous jacket a couple of years prior. "This seems like something I could wear"- thought Norman, as he carefully took the identical gray jacket from the rack. norman arrived home with a jacket carefully placed in a bag. "The one I have now can be worn for a little bit more before I switch to the new one"- he told Norman and turned on the TV set.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5ofzzu/new_jacket/] createDate=[1484656312] score=[22] numComments=[3]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman makes a pun] author=[jukozo] text=[Norman was returning to his desk with his tea.  Margaret at work had made it for him like she had every Tuesday for the last two years as per the tea rota.  Unfortunately Margaret hadn't added sugar and rather than be a bother he added it him self later.  "I'll tell her next time"  he told him for literally the 100th time.  

As he passed Lisa's desk he saw she was playing with her hair and looking at a celebrity magazine.  She was frowning at the headline "it's official pony tails are hot".  She looked up,  saw Norman and smiled.  She piped up,  "Norman,  this magazine says pony tails are in,  I don't like them,  do you?"  

Norman thought,  he'd never really paid much attention to hair.  He'd visited the same barber on the second Saturday of every month for 30 years,  always getting the same short back and sides. But did he like pony tails? Susan Bletchley had one at school and she got everyone to call him Borman after he brought in his stamp collection for show and tell.  And then there was the pony his mother had organised for his fith birthday who got spooked and dragged him for half a mile by the foot.  And he certainly didn't like his ex-wife's new boyfriends ponytail.  "I know"  he thought,  "I'll make a pun".  

"Do I like pony tails you ask? I'd say nei-" 

*Brrrrrrt Brrrrrt* *Brrrrrrt Brrrrrrt* 

It was Lisa's desk phone.  "sorry Norman I have to get that.  Hello Lisa here how can I help?".  

Norman slinked away,  "I'll tell her time"  he thought. He wouldn't.  ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5cx74g/norman_makes_a_pun/] createDate=[1479173937] score=[23] numComments=[0]>

After his blissful mini nap Norman stepped out of bed and stretched before getting in the shower. The water temperature was just right, not too hot, not too cold. He got dressed and headed to work, for the first time in a long time Norman got all the green lights on the way to his office and nobody cut him off because he was going a little under the speed limit (safety first). The nice secretary at work greeted Norman with a warm smile and he gave her one right back. Norman sat at his desk and started working on a project and time flew by until 5:00 caught him off guard. Norman almost couldn’t believe that it was closing time, but nonetheless he got up and gathered his things and left. By some amazing stroke of luck Norman got all green lights on the way back to his house. When Norman opened the door, he was greeted by the soft purring of best friend in the whole world, he closed the door, picked up his beloved cat and sat on his couch to watch his favorite show.

</thread><thread title=[Norman falls down a staircase.] author=[Dolferan] text=[It was a Friday evening and Norman had been working late. He hadn't intended to work late but his colleagues had a lot of work to catch up on.    
&amp;nbsp;    
He was alone.    
&amp;nbsp;    
He liked it like this, when he could hear each individual bubble break the surface in the water cooler. He would slip his unshod toes into the short-nap carpeting and lean back in his chair for a moment, his spine and back-rest creaking in unison.    
&amp;nbsp;    
"Oh. Norman! I thought I was alone."    
&amp;nbsp;    
It was Lisa's voice.    
&amp;nbsp;    
And the rest of her.    
&amp;nbsp;    
"Oh" said Norman with the wrong intonation.    
&amp;nbsp;    
"Worried I'd find you relaxing?"    
&amp;nbsp;    
"Yes," said Norman. "I mean no." He slipped his shoes back on. "I guess you been working on..."   
&amp;nbsp;    
"No, not really. I just like it when it's quiet like this."    
&amp;nbsp;    
Norman smiled: "When it's just you and the water-cooler?"    
&amp;nbsp;    
"Water-cooler?"    
&amp;nbsp;    
"Uh..."    
&amp;nbsp;    
"Are you being poetic?"    
&amp;nbsp;    
"I don't really know. Yes"    
&amp;nbsp;    
Lisa looked to the ceiling: "I like it when all I can hear are the air-conditioning vents."
&amp;nbsp;    
Norman thought about this, "Don't they turn the air-conditioning off at six?"    
&amp;nbsp;    
Lisa smiled, "That's what I mean."    
&amp;nbsp;    
Norman frowned.    
&amp;nbsp;    
"Follow me," she whispered.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Norman rose to his feet and walked across to where Lisa was standing. She turned on her heel and they walked together to her side of the office. Lisa motioned to Norman to take a seat while she pressed her finger to her lip.     
&amp;nbsp;    
Norman strained. "I can't hear anything."    
&amp;nbsp;    
Lisa screwed her eyes, "It's a different kind of silence. You can hear the emptiness in the vents."    
&amp;nbsp;    
Norman nodded earnestly. They each observed the silence in silence.    
&amp;nbsp;    
It was at that moment that Norman became aware of a sound just beyond the edge of hearing. He looked up to Lisa: "I'm just going to nip to the toilet."    
&amp;nbsp;    
She nodded in encouragement.    
&amp;nbsp;    
Norman left the chair and walked quietly towards the staircase down to the ground floor.

</thread><thread title=[Norman hangs himself] author=[rainabunny] text=[It was a gloomy Friday morning in the middle of April. The morning's start is rather bland. Norman feels the need to bring his own cup of joe to the office rather than his usual blend, since he'd rather not waste anymore of the company's material for his own desire. 

He arrives at work just minutes before check-in time and hurriedly sets down his coffee; only to accidentally get a drop on his tan pants. It is not an easy day at work, as Norman feels sheepish for the rest of the day.

He comes home, morose over the weather and accident earlier. He stumbles upon an old photo album of him and his son many years ago. He decides a particular picture of a fishing trip is the one to hang upon his fridge. He recalls that trip being a fun time, and Norman smiles.

Norman thinks: Maybe the day wasn't so bad after all.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4mmme5/norman_hangs_himself/] createDate=[1465146018] score=[25] numComments=[30]>

* They are completely mundane in nature

* Norman has a lot of inner workings that should remind people of their awkward selves

* These inner workings should stretch text time over story time; Norman stories are very slow

* Norman does not show emotions openly. However, *between the lines* there should be a bottomless pit of despair and soul-wrenching loneliness

* There never are any conclusions; no gained wisdom about the world or about anything else. In contrast to normal stories that make you think about something and maybe understand it better, Norman stories never find any "light"

Norman knew this meant it would take more work than usual to ensure that everything was completed by the deadline.

He scanned his keycard and entered the empty office.  He headed to his desk and promptly got to work.  Although he rarely spent time socializing during work hours, he found he was much more productive than usual.  "I guess all the activity of a busy office can be pretty distracting," thought Norman.

After a couple of productive hours, Norman decided he needed a drink.  He walked through the corridor of empty cubicles to kitchen.  He placed his favourite mug under the water cooler and pressed the blue lever but no water came out.  It occured to Norman that after all the years he worked at his offce, he didn't know who filled the water cooler.

At some point, all good things come to an end. Norman and Claire had just spent the last 24 hours together, beginning with a scavenger hunt, a dinner, a long trip to the bar, and then the night in bed. Once the sun came up, the two stayed in bed a few hours longer, laying on their sides and watching the Hawaiian news broadcast. Eventually, after several failed attempts to get out of bed, by both sides, the two decided to head down to the hotel restaurant below.

“Can you order for me?” asked Claire, “I’m just going to head to the lou.”

Norman nodded and perused the menu. Sausage and eggs and toast sounded good, but he couldn’t for the life of him concentrate. He couldn’t get Claire off of his mind. Unfortunately for Norman, the waiter showed up before Norman could get his head straight. 

“What would you like?” asked the waiter.

“Um, I’d like to get the scrambled eggs with sausage, rye bread on the side. Your darkest coffee. Make that two of all of that.”

The waiter nodded. It took a moment for Norman to realize his brevity. Usually, even when he just ordered for himself, his uncertainty left him a bumbling mess. His most common meal was *the special*, even though he never knew what the special would be, he knew he could at least say it without coming off like a numbskull. For once, Norman straightened his back as he sat at the table. He grew to regret that choice, as it made him have to yawn and aggressively stretch his back. His loose arm knocked Claire’s purse off the table. 

Norman’s reflexes were not fast enough to stop the purse from pouring all over the floor. Quickly, before she returned, Norman shoveled the innards back into the bag.

Then he saw it.

A wedding band; gold, and silver, and well worn. 

A moment later, he found a photograph, of a man, and a boy, and Claire.

The waiter came with the coffee.

The table next to Norman was celebrating a birthday, of a woman named Esther, turning 24. The man at the register struggled to find his wallet, and made small talk as he searched. An elderly couple bickered about the noise.

Claire came out of the bathroom, looking for Norman, but his chair was empty. He paid the bill before he left, and by the time Claire tried to search for Norman in his hotel room, he was already gone. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/580rbv/the_continental_breakfast_normans_vacation_part_13/] createDate=[1476777694] score=[21] numComments=[7]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman's Saturday stroll] author=[Saitama123] text=[Norman was looking forward to the day. It was a Saturday morning and he didn’t have anything to do. His lack of obligations added excitement to a generally monotonous day that he had spent for the past two years working at the office. It felt good to be free.
He fed Norman and the newest addition to his family Scruples the dog. He browsed through his local newspaper and learned of a music concert happening in the park that was a few blocks from where he lived. Realizing that this was the first of many obligation free Saturday’s Norman leashed his new dog Scruples and walked out the door in his brand new Generic Expensive Shoes to celebrate his first of many days off.

As he and Scruples walked he caught glances from all kinds of people. Many men in there 40s gave him looks of envy after they caught their wives looking at him and his shoes. They were the same sad and piercing looks he would give to the kids in his school that wore his generations version of Generic Expensive clothes and shoes. A bounce was added to his walk the more awed and jealous looks he received. For perhaps the first time in Norman’s life he felt like a man. Nothing could bring him down.

While turning the corner towards the concert he came upon rows of teens on each side of the path towards the concert. Some sat on benches while others sat on top of black fences. Norman unbeknownst to himself gripped Scruple’s leash tighter as he walked on forward. Norman looked straight ahead as he walked on focusing on a dancing man in the distance. He felt their eyes on him and he heard snickering. The feeling of eyes and their snickering grew louder as he continued to walk. Norman then realized he wasn’t sure if he turned off the oven and headed home. Norman felt good knowing he put the life of Norman above going to a concert.

</thread><thread title=[Norman wants gum] author=[meeme109] text=[Norman was standing around the water cooler with some of his co-workers. They were casually discussing how nice the weather had been over the past few days. One of the co-workers named James pulled a pack of gum out of his pocket; Norman took note. Norman’s gaze darted between James and his pack of gum. Norman hoped that he would be offered a piece of gum, as he thought it would be nice to have something to chew on. 

“Anyone want any gum?” James asked, as he made eye contact with the various co-workers, including Norman. 

“Yeah, sure, I’ll take a piece”, said Lisa, just as Norman was about to say the same. 

Norman considered whether it would be proper to accept the invitation for the gum, now that someone else had taken a piece. Norman did not want to be rude and deplete James’ gum packet so quickly. Norman decided he would not accept the gum, even though he wanted it. 

Norman quietly said “no thanks”, and James put his pack of gum away. 
	
Norman then excused himself from the group and walked back to his desk to continue his work, now more disappointed than before. Norman resolved to splurge and buy a pack of gum the next time he was at a convenience store. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4cw7oh/norman_wants_gum/] createDate=[1459553606] score=[22] numComments=[2]>

Norman on the other hand was having a very interesting morning. He paced near the back door that lead out onto the lawn and meowed loudly. Norman glanced over, this was very unlike Norman to meow. He walked over and noticed a small, soggy cat sitting on his back porch. Norman opened the door and picked up the little fellow. He noticed the small name tag that hung on the collar around his neck. The address was a house just down the road. Norman decided that it was too rainy to let this little kitty stay outside any longer. Norman poured the little guy some kitty food and dried him off with a blanket.
Norman decided that tomorrow he would bring the cat home. Besides Norman liked making new friends. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5i2iqv/norman_gets_a_new_cat/] createDate=[1481646452] score=[21] numComments=[4]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman has plans] author=[wagon_ear] text=[It was a Friday night, and Norman sat at his kitchen table. He had been building a model Millennium Falcon for weeks, and it was almost complete.  


His mind drifted back to earlier that day, when a coworker had invited him out for drinks with the office. “Sorry,” he had replied, attempting a disappointed sigh, “but I already have plans tonight.” Norman knew that his coworkers both pitied and joked about him, but he didn’t mind. He had never been one to feel lonesome; he simply liked feeling alone. He doubted they could grasp the difference.


Returning his thought to the present task, Norman held his breath as his practiced hand moved the final piece into place. He waited for what felt like an eternity before softly exhaling and lifting his tweezers from the Falcon. “It’s done!” he told Norman as he scratched the cat gently behind the ears.


He opened a celebratory beer – it was the weekend, after all – and settled down into his recliner. He dozed off almost immediately, with Norman purring in his lap and a faint smile on his face.

</thread><thread title=[Norman and the Hurricane] author=[EpicTrollMom] text=[Norman returned home from work on Wednesday evening and turned on the news. Everyone in the office had been on edge because of a hurricane that was looming in the Atlantic. There was potential for a direct hit and the newscaster emphasized how deadly the storm could be. A mandatory evacuation was announced.


The phone rang and startled Norman, as he was fully absorbed in the news broadcast. It was Lisa from work. "Hello Lisa," Norman answered. "Oh hi, Norman. The office is going to be closed for the rest of the week because the city is under an evacuation order. I'm heading to my sister's house in Atlanta first thing tomorrow." Norman thanked Lisa for calling and hurriedly but politely said his goodbyes because his call waiting was beeping. "It's probably the boss calling to tell me about the closing," thought Norman.



Norman clicked to the other line and answered. The caller was a pleasant surprise. It was Norman's son. He said, "Dad, that hurricane is coming right towards you. Please come and stay with me until it passes."  Norman didn't want to be an inconvenience but his son insisted. Norman hung up the phone and pulled out the pet carrier. Smiling ear to ear, he called out to his cat, "Come along Norman. We're going on a trip."

</thread><thread title=[Norman watches a great movie] author=[deep_blue_ocean] text=[Norman settled onto his couch, adjusting the cushions behind his back to make things a bit more comfy.  "I should really think about getting that new living room set" he mentioned to Norman who lay sprawled out on the armrest behind his head.  After all that particular piece was only ever meant to be temporary, a starter item really.

Picking up the remote control, Norman thumbed through his Netflix que and tried to judge what mood he was in.  It was Saturday night after all, perhaps a thriller?  He continued to scroll through the lists.  He'd seen so much already it seemed.

Thirty minutes later Norman decided on Into the Wild.

After it was over he went into the kitchen to clean up the dishes leftover from dinner earlier that evening.

"What if I decided to change my life Norman?" he questioned the cat who had followed on his heels.  "I could sell this old house and make for a change.  Maybe what I really need is a different job."

Norman thought about it.  He could sell the house and use the proceeds to fund a trip, maybe walk the Appalachian trail himself.  It would be temporary really, some time off from his desk job and daily expectations.  To figure out what he really wanted from life, where he wanted to go now that his son had moved away.  

Norman felt more determined than ever as he completed cleaning the kitchen and made his way to bed.  It was a great feeling.

The next day, Norman was woken up by the ring of his cell phone.  It was his boss, wanting him to come into the office to get caught up for Monday.  "No big deal" Norman said to Norman, "This'll be just the thing to impress the boss.  Maybe it'll really change things at work."

Later that day when Norman walked in from his impromptu shift, he was greeted by Norman purring delightedly.  He bent over and picked up his cat, "My day?" he responded to his cat's inquiry, "It was just fine."  He smiled and sat down on his couch, readjusting the pillows.

"So, what should we watch tonight?" He questioned as he powered on the T.V.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/55h798/norman_watches_a_great_movie/] createDate=[1475418842] score=[21] numComments=[1]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Breaks Wind] author=[onijake] text=[It was midday Monday as Norman sat in his cubicle working meticulously as always. Norman noticed his posture had begun leaning to one side, as he had been sitting for an extended period of time. “I better sit up straight. I don’t want develop any lumbar issues,” Norman thought to himself, “It would be a shame if I couldn’t bend down to feed Norman.”

Shifting his weight, Norman unintentionally caused his old office chair to creak in a way that sounded like passing gas. A surge of embarrassment passed through Norman and his anxiety rose: The thought of leering stares, disgusted expressions, and humiliating laughter was all too much for Norman to stomach. 

Promptly, Norman thought, “If I make the sound *again*, perhaps people will realize it was just the chair and not flatulence.” In the most collected manner he could, Norman wrapped his clammy hands around the armrests and shifted his weight again. The loud creak was a relief. Norman made the sound a few more times just to make sure. “Better safe than sorry,” he thought. Norman quickly got back to work.

Norman's mother treats him well: she always cooks what he desires, and he can freely talk about his week while she is preparing the meal. She never asks him about girls or other private topics.

Last Sunday, however, Norman called his mother as usual to tell her he was getting in his car right now and would be at hers in 25 minutes. His mother announced that today was special because his sister and nephews would be joining them! Norman became a little nervous. "I just remembered I fell behind at a project at work, and should stay at home to finish that up", he told his mother,"see you next week".


He pulled the keys out of the car door and went back inside. He felt proud of himself for having bought an extra frozen lasagna the day before.

Norman was impressed with the number of people who waved and nodded to Frank as they entered the pub. When Norman attempted his own low head nod to the group of rugged, plaid and denim ridden people, he was met with a rather dismal comparison of friendliness. 

“Grab us a seat at the counter, I’m gonna take a piss first.” said Frank. Norman looked to the counter, and after flagging down the bartender to make sure it’s okay, placed a coat on one chair and sat in the other.

Norman wasn’t sure what kind of drink Frank would be into, so to play it safe Norman ordered two of his favorite alcoholic beverages, Palm Bay.

“Hah! Very funny!” chuckled the bartender. “Frank will get a kick out of that.”

Norman laughed uncomfortably too. 
	
After Frank had returned from the bathroom, and had a good laugh at the joke Norman made, he ordered a line of shots without hesitation. Norman remembered an old party game he would play with his high school friends, called telephone. One person would whisper a sentence into someone’s ear, and then that person would whisper it to the next person, and by the end of the game, they would see how jumbled and misinterpreted the sentence would be. Norman wasn’t sure how he could get the game going with just Frank and himself, but perhaps if the bartender was involved-


“Norman, do you know what I want for my birthday?”

“Hmm?”

In quick succession, Frank downed the four shots in front of him. “I want to entirely forget that it’s my birthday.” Frank smiled wildly before ordering another line of shots.

</thread><thread title=[Norman goes on a date] author=[Hellen_Kellers_GYM] text=[Norman was a simple man. He took pride in his simple life. However, on this particular day, Norman was no ordinary man. That day, he could become a lover. Right before his date, Norman had told Norman, his cat, how excited he was to meet this woman he would be taking on a date.

Though he was excited, Norman's hand became clammy. He had been waiting way too long to meet his mystery date. Norman had been sitting in his seat waiting for his lovely guest to come just long enough to become frightened. Norman did not like being frightened. His bald head held a series of unfortunate events that could unfold, he could fart, he could spill his drink... Norman jumped straight up, fixing his posture as his date came into view. He sucked in his belly, breathed out his anxiety-or at least tried to- and looked into the beautiful eyes of his dreamy date.

She was gorgeous. Stunning. Norman was in a spell, he tried to say hello but nothing came out. "I-I...I'm" Norman shyly choked out "I'm Norman?". Now embarrassed, Norman put his hands over his eyes and wished that this date would end.

But in trying to cover his face showing an expression of pain mixed with regret, he knocked over his water from the coffee table. Norman quickly shut off his television. Shaking, Norman reached for his cat, Norman, and told him how stressing "The Bachelorette" was; from waiting through those commercials in his seat, to finally meeting his date. Norman smiled through a grimace and told how awful dating was to his cat. How he much preferred to be all by himself. How fun it was, waking to his cat Norman. How good living through the same day, every day, for the rest of his simple, comfortable life was going to be. After all, Norman was a simple man. He took pride in his simple life.

Norman was lonely. Norman was so terribly lonely.

<comment number=[1]author=[GentlemanTwain]text=[This reddit page reminds me terribly of "the Tale of Mr. Morton," a school house rock song about a simple man's simple life with his cat. It's actually pretty similar to this story at some parts.

The Bachelorette part made me laugh only to betray me with the emotional gut punch that was the ending. Part of what makes Norman so special is how there's a bit of him in all of us, which in a way makes any hardships he faces hit all the harder when it happens to him. Norman is sort of a blank slate we can all laugh about and project onto, and sometimes because of this he can make us think deeper about our own lives.

Now I'm rambling. All I'm really trying to say is that I liked your story because it made me think more deeply about Norman and how he relates to me, to all of us.

Lisa sauntered by his cubicle and the weekly tradition commenced.

"How's it going, Norman?"

"It's going well, you?"

"What can I say? It's a Friday."

Norman chuckled as Lisa returned to her cubicle to whittle away the remaining 15 minutes. This time, however, Norman realized the entire "It's Friday" charade was painfully obvious. Not to say he'd been unaware, but Norman could really hear it in his own voice today, as if he were a spectator witnessing it all from a third person perspective.

"Well, Norman...it seems like you're in good health," the doctor said, pulling off his gloves and dropping them in the trash. "Just keep your food intake reasonable. Neither of us are getting younger, after all."

Norman turned his head away and blinked slowly, and scratched his ear.

"Thank you, Doctor," Norman said, scooping Norman off the exam table. "See you in six months for his next checkup."

"Don't forget that he will need a booster shot next time."

When Norman went out to pay, he was pleased that he had remembered that his bill would be $72, after the nail trim, and that he had budgeted the money weekly so that it wouldn't be an inconvenient bill.

Probably not, he thought. Lots of people have that colour and make of car.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5qfr53/norman_gets_a_checkup/] createDate=[1485528854] score=[18] numComments=[3]>

To celebrate, he decided to try something new for dinner. Norman had eaten Chinese food before, but it had been several years and his mouth watered at the memories. His hands shook a bit with excitement as he dialed the number of the local Chinese place and told them his order. Five minutes later, he left home to pick up his dinner- Better to be early than late, after all. After picking up the food and paying, Norman drove back home, poured Norman a bowl of food, and sat down at the kitchen table to eat his food. As Norman told Norman about his day, the taste of Chinese food filled his mouth and he was content.

"Norman, there's a fortune cookie in here!" Norman said excitedly. "I wonder what my fortune is."

Norman cracked open the fortune cookie, and read the slip of paper inside: "Expect great changes in your life soon."

"Better not get too ambitious," Norman said flatly as he neatly folded the slip of paper in two and placed it gently in his wallet, behind his driver's license.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/54hr44/norman_orders_chinese_food/] createDate=[1474874723] score=[20] numComments=[1]>

Norman had just had sex. The sentence sounded odd to him too. Norman never really thought about sex, at least, not in a very long time. When him and his wife divorced, over a decade ago, things were already quite rough. He tried to remember the last time he had sex with her, and he wasn’t sure. If he were to guess it would have been New Years 2002. To Norman, sex had become synonymous with his ex-wife; the only woman he had ever been with; the woman who left him for another man. Suffice to say that left him feeling rather disconnected from the world that so many desperately desired to be a part of. 

Claire was different. To Norman, it wasn’t the act that stood out. It was the everything after. She slept sparsely, keeping awake to run her fingers along Norman’s stomach, her head resting on his chest. Norman’s arm was going numb, keeping it draped around her shoulders. He liked that it was going numb; it meant that she was as close as she could be.

“Your heart is racing,” Claire whispered. 

“Sorry.”

“You don’t need to apologize so much, Norman. You have more confidence than what you liked to believe.”

“Then I’m not sorry.”

Norman felt her smile form on his chest. Norman ran his fingers down her back, gently rubbing her shoulders every now and then. He would squeeze her tight, and their middle aged bodies and bones crinkled and cracked so much they couldn’t help but laugh.

Norman breathed in, and breathed out, and so did she, until the sun came up and their stomachs started to growl. 

For once in Norman’s life, Norman forgot that hotel’s had free continental breakfast. That surprise would be waiting for them for when they would decide to get out of bed.

"Hey Norm," she beamed. 

"Hmm, 'Norm'," he chuckled inwardly, "its new, but I like it."

She laughed "Aw, you too Norman." 

Norman returned to his desk. So "Norm" didn't really stick, but he was okay with that. "Norman" suited him much better anyways. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4q7it3/norman_gets_a_nickname/] createDate=[1467115388] score=[19] numComments=[0]>

___

"Dear Dad:"

The cursor blinked expectantly on Norm's computer as he massaged his temples. His most difficult exams were over. Carol from the mood study had suggested that Norm write out his thoughts about Norman in a letter. Norm had been ruminating about his Dad since he called about Convocation; maybe the letter would help calm him. He decided to stop trying for a minute and look for work online. While his Mom had already offered him a job at her firm, Norm wanted to see if he could strike out on his own.

The front door slammed open to the sound of hollering. Steve's back, thought Norm. Shit. Even though the thin door to his room was closed it would be seconds before that ape of a man turned on his massive stereo and burs-

"Hey, buddy! Time to get wasted!" For Steve it was always time to get wasted. Norm for his part preferred to wait until the weekend before considering the idea. Or at the very least until nightfall. Norm wondered how Steve had kept his grades up. Probably the same way he kept everything up, a combination of deceit and perversion built on a foundation of unlimited wealth. Nobody knew where Steve's family had made their fortune.

Norm's excuse about having to study scored a "lame" from Steve but once he agreed to go out for the evening Steve left him mercifully alone. Looking for work was a novelty of sorts for Norm. He had never needed to work; the only things on his resume for work experience were jobs that either his mother had created for him or internships that she had smooth-talked into existence for him.

Tossing his resume into the digital void for a few postings, Norm went back to the letter.

"Dear Dad:

I am writing to you today to set an account of our relationship..."

Norm shuddered as he pressed the delete key. An unwashed plate rattled on his desk, moved by the thunderous bass of the beats pounding in the living room. If there was anything to look forward to with the end of school it was the end of having to live with Steve and his revolving door of meaningless friends.

"Dear Dad:

I'm sorry that Randy broke your nose in the parking lot after the school play. I'm sorry..."

That's not how letters should start, Norm thought. Why had his mind jumped immediately to that unhappy memory? But Carol had told him to write what came naturally to him. What did come to him was a confusing mess of sadness, frustration, and lamentation weakly buttressed by crumbling syntax. It wasn't any kind of letter Norm would ever let see the light of day. Well, at least he had a list of things to talk about with Carol. He ended the letter before he totally collapsed.

"...why did you never call?"

Outside, the sound of smashing glass and cheers. He was dreading tonight's "partying" already.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4mn2wz/where_were_you_norman/] createDate=[1465156706] score=[20] numComments=[3]>

After using the bathroom, Norman reached over to grab a paper towel and noticed it was white, instead of the normal brown. "Oh, how strange! I wonder if we ran out of brown paper towels." He thought to himself. As he went to leave the bathroom and go back to his desk, he decided he liked the white ones better since they were softer. "Perhaps they will keep the white ones." He thought.

</thread><thread title=[Norman makes some young friends.] author=[Johnny_Ibanez] text=[On a Saturday afternoon in August, Norman closed his sudoku book having completed one of the more fiendishly difficult puzzles. His sense of accomplishment was promptly interrupted by the sound of the doorbell. "Who could this be?" he thought to himself as he stood up. With an increasing sense of intrigue, he opened his front door to find nobody was there. With a furrowed brow, he closed the door and slid the doorchain back into position. 

"That was strange, wasn't it?" he said to Norman. Norman blinked back in agreement and curled back into his sleeping position.

No sooner had he returned to his chair and the doorbell rang again. He rose again, walked to the door, unslid the doorchain and opened the door. Nobody there. Norman took a step outside and looked around. The street seemed to be deserted. Across the street he noticed the neighbours' car. There were two young boys crouched behind it giggling to themselves. Norman smiled to himself and pretended not to see them. He went back inside and waited behind the door. As he waited, his smile became a chuckle as he rememered playing this game when he was a boy with his friend who lived two doors down. Norman wondered what old Richard was up to these days. He hadn't heard from his old friend since his father took a job in another city and they moved away. Norman hadn't thought about Richard for a long time. He was his best friend. 

Norman's nostaligia was interrupted by the sound of approaching footsteps and hushed childish giggling from the other side of the door. The doorbell rang and footsteps scampered away. Norman decided not to open the door straight away. That would spoil the game. Allowing an appropriate amount of time for the boys to resume their hiding place, Norman cleared his smile and opened the door. He stepped outside, still pretending not to see the boys behind the car across the street. He theatrically scratched his head in wonderment. He looked up and down the street, with his hand shiedling his eyes from the summer sun. As he scanned, he could see the boys trying to smother their laughter behind their hands. Norman found this strangly thrilling. He gave a dramatic shrug to himself and turned around, allowing a small smile to creep back to his lips. He could hear the boys laughing out loud as he closed the door behind him.

Waiting behind the door again, Norman rememered how he used to make Norman Jr laugh when he was a young boy by acting the fool. Norman Jr laughed hardest when he did his pirate impression. "Arr, it be time te be goin' te bed, matey. Ya harr" he'd say, to Juniors squeals of delight. Norman chuckled to himself and wondered what Norman Jr was doing today. 

Norman decided that the next time the door bell rang, he would open the door quickly and shout "YARRRR!!!" like a pirate. He hoped it would make them laugh. He would have to make sure it was not too aggressive. He didn't really want to scare the boys. He waited with his hand on the door handle and listened closely, but he couldn't hear anything.

After two or three minutes had passed, Norman returned to his chair. He scratched Norman behind the ear and smiled to himself, still lost in nostalgia. He reached for his phone, flipped it open, and with his index finger typed the message "YA HARR MA8EY!" and sent it to his son. He watched the message send and closed the phone.

Two hours later, Norman was watching CSI when his phone beeped. He opened it up and saw that it was a message from his son. It was a single question mark.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5izben/norman_makes_some_young_friends/] createDate=[1482077331] score=[17] numComments=[0]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Takes the Bus] author=[lizaurr-] text=[Norman’s alarm clock had run out of battery, he woke up to the bright sunlight peeking in through the curtains. Still half-asleep, Norman considered staying in the warm and comfortable bed a bit longer. As he was nodding off again, he suddenly realised it was Friday! Completely awake now, Norman jumped out of bed, already feeling the adrenaline coursing through his body. He rummaged through his briefcase to find his phone. 

The time showed 7:20. He usually left the house in ten minutes, but he couldn’t make it. Norman decided to skip his morning shower and changed out of the pyjamas to the first shirt and trousers he found. He walked fast through his apartment, careful not to wake up Norman sleeping in the hallway. Norman quickly gulped down a glass of milk and made his way to the door. In all the rush, he had forgotten to check today’s weather forecast. He grabbed his jacket and umbrella and opened the door.

As he got out of the building, Norman noticed it was too hot to wear a jacket and the sky was clear of clouds. It was too late to go back to his floor, though, so he started walking towards the bus stop. On his way there, Norman found himself walking next to the bus he was taking, line 584. Coming out of a red light, the vehicle started accelerating, while Norman watched it getting farther and farther from him. 

The bus stop was 100 metres away, Norman hesitated; should he sprint to catch the bus or let it go? While considering his options, he started to walk-jog. But he was too slow, the bus was already leaving. Norman slowed down his pace and casually took out his phone. He stared at the black screen, making sure no one thought him to be out of place.

Ten minutes later, Norman got on the next bus. Covered in cold sweat, he sat down by his usual place next to the door. He checked the time again; 7:50. He’d make it on time to the office, but he wouldn’t have time to grab his morning coffee. As Norman adjusted his tie, he noticed an orange stain on his white shirt. Embarrassed, he put on his jacket, buttoning it closed. He felt hot.

Upon arriving at work, Norman’s co-workers in the office greeted him good morning as he walked through, as usual. He felt, however, preying eyes staring as his face became redder and redder. He spent a bad day at work. Thankfully, it was Friday and he had two days off to recover from the incident. On his way back home, Norman didn’t forget to buy two packets of batteries for his alarm clock.

He strolled to the kitchen were he found the source of his uncomfortable state of mind: the kitchen clock was seemingly broken. 

Norman inspected the clock. It appeared as if the hands were frozen at 12:58. Norman decided to step away as inspecting broken goods was hazardous if not properly equipped.

Norman started to fret. It was already 7:36 and he was going to be late for work. He dressed, ate breakfast, then fed Norman, who purred approvingly. "I shall call the clocks manufacturer at work," he said to Norman.

At work, Norman picked up the landline telephone. His hands were noticeably clammy. When the robotic voice asked him to press 1, it was all too much for Norman. He hung up.

Still shaken from his earlier encounter, Norman settled in front of CSI with Norman on his lap.

"Maybe I will get further tomorrow," he sighed.

Eventually he decided a house plant may be just the ticket. It would only need water and perhaps it would make Norman feel as though he were outside. The next day, he stopped by the grocery store and purchased a plant which the label indicated was a "Norfolk Island Pine."

Norman stood in the lobby of the hotel, holding a small bag of trinkets in his hand. The bag was given to him by the organizers of the retreat; inside was items needed for a scavenger hunt. Each item was labelled “Norman”, and was meant for a specific location. Each person would have to drop off their trinkets at the various places to show that they indeed explored the island.

Norman hadn’t yet began his adventure, and that was because of Claire. The day before, Norman and the woman went on their own adventure. It started with coffee in a small local restaurant, and afterwards they strolled aimlessly through the city. Norman bought himself some new sunglasses. They were a goofy pink pair of glasses, and Claire bought a matching pair for herself. Around sunset, Norman and Claire had chicken for dinner at the hotel. Norman, not one to be particularly bold, parted with her at her hotel room that night.

Norman’s chest felt tight as he waited in the lobby. Perhaps Claire had already left on the scavenger hunt by herself. Perhaps she was waiting for Norman to leave, so she could go by herself without Norman’s dull company. Despite spending a wonderful evening before with her, today he felt the loneliest he’s felt since his wife left. Feeling defeated, Norman headed back up to his hotel room. He didn’t feel like doing the scavenger hunt alone.

As Norman exited the elevator on his floor, he looked down the hall to see Claire knocking on someone’s door. His door. Norman smiled in relief. 

“I thought you already left!” Claire shouted as Norman walked towards her.

“No no,” Norman said, “I just felt that I forgot something. Would you like to come on the hunt with me?”

“I was going to ask you the same,” Claire said.

</thread><thread title=[Norman Gets a Friend Request] author=[Titansjester] text=[Today was a Friday and Norman had an exciting weekend planned.  There was a CSI marathon that would be starting that night and continuing throughout the weekend. The marathon would end on Sunday with a brand new episode. Giddy with excitement, Norman finished up his work at five o'clock sharp and gathered his things to leave.  On the way out,  Norman encountered Lisa in the parking lot.  "Hey,  Norman" she said, "a few of us from work are going to get drinks tonight. Would you like to come?"  Remembering the marathon,  Norman apologized and said he already had plans for the weekend. "Alright,"  she replied with a smile,  "why don't you send me a friend request on Facebook and I'll give you some notice next time."  Norman agreed, and Lisa went on her way.  Only after Lisa had left did Norman realize that he did not have a Facebook account. He resolved to make one as soon as he had returned home.  "I am a man if my word," he thought. 

When Norman got home, he greeted Norman and sat down at his computer.  He checked the clock and saw that he had two hours before CSI started. Deciding that he would have plenty of time he opened Internet Explorer and, after glancing at the latest news on MSN, typed "www.google.com" into the search bar and hit enter.  Once on the Google homepage, he searched "how to sign up for a Facebook account" and, because he happened to be feeling particularly daring, clicked I'm Feeling Lucky.  Norman was directed to the Facebook sign up page and began to fill in his information. Once he had finished he sent Lisa  a friend request, as promised, and checked the clock again.  It was 7:30 and CSI started at 8:00. Norman had just enough time to make a microwave dinner and feed Norman before the episode started.  Once his dinner was ready, Norman sat down to watch CSI until 10:00 when he promptly went to bed. 

The next morning Norman awoke at 6:00 and fed Norman, fixing himself a bowl of unflavored oatmeal.  Normand decided that he would check to see if Lisa had accepted his friend request. Norman sat down at his computer and opened Facebook.  When the website loaded, he noticed a small red number on one of the icons and clicked on it.  A message appeared on the screen that said "Norman Jr. would like to be your friend." Norman could hardly contain his excitement and clicked accept. Clicking on Norman Jr.'s name brought Norman to his son's profile where he had pictures of him and his friends at college.  Norman smiled to himself, happy to be a part of his son's life and grateful Norman Jr. would take the time to send the request.  Norman considered posting on Norman Jr's wall but decided that his son seemed much too busy for such frivolities. Instead,  Norman shut down his computer and sat down on the couch to watch CSI.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4btses/norman_gets_a_friend_request/] createDate=[1458885565] score=[17] numComments=[2]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman eats Mexican food.] author=[lifeor] text=[Norman stared at the menu for Anna's Taqueria. He had a hard time making up his mind because he felt pressured by the long line of people behind him. Before he was ready to order, the worker asked him what he wanted. "A regular burrito" Norman stuttered after a slight pause.

At the cashier, Norman decided to buy a mango soda. He then remembered that after consuming the soda, he would be ten grams over his sugar limit. Norman went with a bottled water instead, since the tap water might be contaminated.

"Your total is twelve dollars," his cashier lazily told him. That didn't make sense to Norman. The regular burrito was six dollars, and the bottled water was two dollars.

"Can you review my order please?" Norman asked.

"You're paying for a large burrito and a bottled water." 

Norman realized that his order had been screwed up. He could either ask for them to fix it or he could pay for the wrong order.

"Okay" Norm said solemnly as he pulled out his credit card and made the transaction.

Norm ate his dinner alone in silence, knowing that he'd have to cancel his CBS subscription for a few weeks since he was over his budget. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5lkvak/norman_eats_mexican_food/] createDate=[1483386089] score=[17] numComments=[2]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Has a Date] author=[MattressCrane] text=[Norman dusted off the table cloth he stored in the bottom of the duvet closet, draping it over the kitchen table. He didn’t use the cloth often, so the smell which presumably was once Spring Fresh now smelled more like a musty carpet. Norman didn’t mind musty carpet smell; it reminded him of church, and recitals, and the basement of his parent’s home, where as a teenage boy, often hid dirty magazines under the stairwell. A sinking feeling entered his stomach as he realized those magazines were forgotten; left behind to surprise the new home owners.

Norman cleared his conscience by turning his full attention to basting the chicken that had just come out of the oven. After that, Norman prepared the store bought buns by placing them in the microwave for fifteen seconds, and the lit two oblong candles sitting on the dinner table.

Norman saved his bow tie for special occasions, but as the year closed and he struggled to find significance from any one event, he decided today would be a day worth remembering.

Which is why Norman set a plate out for his cat as well.

The cat, after some luring by clapping the seat and following a trail of tuna bits, jumped up on the chair across from Norman. The cat quickly found the chicken, and after a moment of hesitation, began to enjoy the meal along with Norman.

Norman smiled, humming his favorite song as he chewed a chunk of fat. He knew how he looked right now- having a bow-tie dinner with a cat- but Norman didn’t care what people would think of the situation. He loved his cat, and his cat made him feel happy. The bow-tie made him feel handsome. What more could he ask for?

Norman set the timer on the camera to twenty seconds, to give himself plenty of time to sit back down at the table and smile. Norman realized twenty seconds was far too much time after it took him three seconds to sit back down. A bead of sweat ran down his head, and from the corner of his eye he watched his cat, hoping he would look up to the camera in time as well. The cat was emancipated by the chicken.

At the last second, the cat looked up, and Norman’s stiffly held smile finally paid off. The photo looked washed out from the flash, but it captured the moment, and that’s all that Norman wanted.

Norman took a magnet and placed the new photo on the fridge, proudly. The two finished off the last season of CSI before heading to bed.

This would save him the work of fixing the lawnmower he currently had, and he could then take his earnings and buy a less expensive lawnmower, considering his garden home had a small lawn. His mom was getting dressed to go to the club, lamenting motherhood, so tuned Norman out in favor of Nina Simone's Feelin Good, her favorite "get ready" song.

</thread><thread title=[Norman attends parent-teacher night] author=[Dotcor_Strangelove] text=[It was late November, some years ago when Norman Junior was still in tenth grade.  Norman showed up to the school at 6:00 in the evening for the semi-annual parent teacher conference.  Norman sat beside him in the car, stewing over his dad's appraisal of his report card. It had been mostly a mix of A's and B's, but Norman's attention had been drawn to a C+ in algebra.


"Dad, it's not even a big deal," Norman began.  "I did okay in my other classes, and other kids are doing way worse than me in algebra."


Norman wouldn't hear of it. "I know it doesn't seem like a big deal, but remember that the skills you learn here will follow you forever.  It may not be the algebra that you need, but learning how to focus your mind and study is a skill that always comes in handy."


Norman Junior climbed out without speaking into the cool fall air and walked towards the building.  Norman sighed and locked the car before following him inside.  Maybe he didn't hear the message, or maybe he was just too young to listen to it, but Norman felt that the point was an important one to make.  After all, there may come a day when he wouldn't be sitting beside his son to offer these pieces of wisdom.


Years later, in another parking lot beside another high school, Norman Junior turned off his car and turned to his son.  "Look, Kyle, it's not about the C, it's about the habits.  You might never need calculus, but learning to focus and study will help you forever."  


Kyle didn't speak, but let out a bored huff before getting out and closing the door behind him.  Norman sighed and locked the car before following him inside.  Maybe he didn't hear the message, or maybe he was just too young to listen to it, but Norman felt that the point was an important one to make.  After all, there may come a day when he wouldn't be sitting beside his son to offer these pieces of wisdom.

</thread><thread title=[Norman's apartment is too small] author=[bf2gud] text=[It was Saturday and Norman was sitting at his tiny table in his tiny kitchen, enjoying his breakfast coffee. Despite the ugly, pastel yellow cupboards and outdated kitchen appliances, Norman quite enjoyed spending time here. He had lots of fond memories looking out the window together with Norman the cat. 

However, this morning wouldn't be remembered fondly.

Norman spotted a puddle in front of his kitchen sink and concluded that the pipes were leaking. After spending ten seconds attempting to fix the problem himself, he decided to call the local plumber, Joshua. The last time Joshua came by, he had told Norman a rather funny story which Norman hoped to hear again.

An hour later, Joshua showed up at Norman's door. 

"Neuberg Plumbing. Sink?"

Norman nodded politely and pointed towards his kitchen. The man laid down under the sink and started working on the pipes. Rather disappointed that Joshua didn't seem to remember him, Norman sat down at his kitchen table once again. After a minute of silence, Norman felt a bit intrusive, worrying that he might be bothering Joshua.

Instead, he walked to his living room and sat down in the only armchair occupying the room. But the armchair was facing the entrance of the kitchen where Joshua was, forcing Norman to observe his work. Once again, Norman didn't want to bother Joshua and stood up.

Norman walked to his bedroom. Even though he had slept in this morning, he thought that napping would be a great way to let time fly. When he entered the bedroom, he saw that Norman the cat had occupied his pillow. Norman the cat was sleeping and looked very peaceful. Norman didn't want to disturb him. Instead, he sat down on a chair next to his bed which he normally used to store laundry.

Norman watched Norman's body gently bob up and down as he breathed.

He had looked in all of the regular places for food but had found nothing but a few stale crumbs on a dish, which he had by this point completely licked clean. If only he could find Norman, maybe then he would be able to fill the void growing in his stomach. Norman set out on another search of the normal Norman places, the comfy armchair, the old clawfoot bathtub, the space under the bed that Norman sometimes hid when he had a particularly nasty nightmare. Nothing. Norman was simply nowhere to be found. Norman was just about to exit the small bedroom when he noticed two familiar feet underneath the closet door. The door was pulled closed but not latched so Norman easily bumped it open to reveal Norman, fast asleep. Norman was so soundly sleeping that he did not even notice the door to the closet opening, but rather, remained curled up gently snoring. Norman, so hungry he could hardly control himself, reached out for Norman. However, just before Norman reached Norman, Norman's eyes opened lazily and looked into Norman's eyes with a look as if to say, "I'd rather you didn't, thank you very much."

***
The year was 2002, and Norman had just come home from work. The day went well- the best any first week could go when starting a new job. It was his first office job, after finishing an internship at a separate branch, Norman was promoted to an entry level accountant. After Junior had been born, Norman was nervous about how the bills would be paid with his wife on leave. The job was a tick on a list Norman was eager to check. What Norman had left on his list however, was his wife.

Things weren’t going well. Bills were one thing the baby brought, but it also brought Norman and his then girlfriend of three months into a very difficult situation.

“Maybe it’s for the best,” Norman said when they first learned the news. She nodded optimistically, sitting in the hospital waiting room. “Adoption is always an option too, you know.”

“Norman…” she started, but didn’t finish. Norman took a deep breath, squeezing the palm of her hand. 

Two years after that, the year was 2002, and Norman had just come home from work. Junior played in his baby bouncer as Norman’s wife prepared dinner, chicken breasts and rice. Norman wasn’t a fan of chicken, but he wasn’t one to complain to his wife. *She has enough on her plate as is,* Norman thought.

Dinner was served at the table as the three of them craned their heads towards the living room, absent-mindedly watching America’s Funniest Home Videos as it played on the television, still muted from before. A small dog ran into a plate glass window. Norman chuckled softly, and Junior, a fourteen month old baby, laughed so hard that he spewed up the chicken back onto the plate.

Norman only managed a jerk forward motion to clean up before his wife took the lead. She took the plate out of Junior’s reach and tossed it into the kitchen sink, clanging violently with the dishes from the day before. She then went over to Junior, pulled his shirt off, and stomped over to the laundry room.

“Need any help?” Norman muttered. No response.

She disappeared into the laundry room, shutting the door behind her. *What’s she doing in there?* Norman wondered. Norman continued to eat his dinner. Ten minutes later the episode of AFV had finished(the plate glass dog had won the ten grand), and Norman’s wife still hadn’t come out of the laundry room. Norman wondered if she was angry at him, if it was something he said. He didn’t see why that would be- he barely said anything at all this evening. Was it his socks? He did do a lot of walking about today, and perhaps the stench was getting to her.

Norman walked quickly past the shut door and headed for the bedroom, finding a fresh pair of socks and put them on. He then sat down in his recliner, a wedding present from the in-laws. He picked up Junior and placed him on his knee, rhythmically bouncing the little boy as he flipped through the channels, looking for something different to watch.

<comment number=[1]author=[Odrevan]text=[Interesting change of pace flashback episode. Maybe an idea to juxtapose Norman and franks marriages and both their downfalls? What did keep her in the laundry room?

Couple of things to note, year should probably read 2004 in paragraph five and 'one' should prob be changed to 'won' in the aside in paragraph 9.

Moving forward, I'm intrigued at your decision to have the penultimate leg of the series as a flashback - it doesn't give you much time to 'resolve' the story as it were before the close. I'm guessing you did it on purpose and it'll be very relevant either thematically or literally to the plot in the last episode but you seem to be cutting it fine. You've also strayed away from Frank in the last few episodes and the title of the story arc is 'Norman &amp; Frank. Will we be seeing more of him in the finale? I liked the look into his mind we got back at the start in the bar and how he truly acted when he and his wife were fighting in the room, but I feel we need more of a connection to his story. Then again having a Norman centric episode doesn't hurt as it is Norman and Frank, but it would have been nice to have gotten a Frank one too!

All in all I've been nitpicking for far too long given how much I'm actually enjoying the arc, but it's because I'm enjoying it so much I'm sharing these thoughts I'm having. Nice work as usual Mattress!]score=[2] </comment>
<comment number=[2]author=[MattressCrane]text=[Thanks for the feedback and real time consuming of the storyline! I think yeah, what's going to matter more in the end, as this penultimate story suggests, is that the theme is the stronger element of this arc than the plot is. We'll see how Frank ties back in in the next part, but I think it'll be a day later than tomorrow before it's finished. I have the ending in mind, but I'm still toying around with how much we'll get to know in the end. From the beginning this was always all about Norman; Frank was always supposed to be the juxtaposition than to be the central point of these stories. I'll make it good, maybe not satisfying, but that's how these stories usually go anyways. 

Also... why do I want it to be 2004? ]score=[1] </comment>
<comment number=[3]author=[Odrevan]text=[Very enjoyable to follow it real time, getting to engage in conversations while it's still on adds to the enjoyment! I figured it was a thematic decision alright, and part 8 itself was solid, I just hope you wrap it all up well in part 9! No pressure on the time schedule, you've been delivering them at a quick pace, one could understand if you wanted a couple days to toy with the ending! 

On the topic of the story being about Norman, that's fair and that's your own creative decision, I guess the fleshing out of Frank in the bar scene made me think it was going a different way! 

I like the idea of exploring Norman's own failures through someone else!

A good ending should be satisfying enough by itself! Be it a happy or sad conclusion, what message you sign off with will definitely be brilliant, I've enjoyed how you've been building up the story thematically. Seeing Norman's shortcomings too has been a worthwhile writing exercise. At the end of the day I do feel he's too passive in his own life, lots of us suffer from that trait. 

I thought you might want 2004 as your opening paragraph read: "The year was 2002", and your 5th paragraph began with: "Two years after that, the year was 2002"]score=[2] </comment>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Attends a Conference Call] author=[killjoy95] text=[For Norman, going to work five days a week was a boon. Not that he believed in the divine or anything, but the daily eight hours he spent nested in his padded five-by-five cubicle was a gift of solace; a break from the spontaneity of the rest of his routine. 

His cat, Norman, having wanted an extra quarter-serving of cat food after his evening meal, had stressed Norman out as he attempted to fall asleep the night before. The day's continuous, occupying task of filling out spreadsheets put him at ease, temporarily making him forget about how he'd need to re-allocate his household budget to accommodate Norman's growing appetite.

Unfortunately for Norman, his routine was interrupted by a surprise visit from his neighbor in the opposite cubicle: Ricky. Ricky had been going through the labyrinth of cubicles, posting memos on each to convey a message from their project manager, Geoff. Upon reaching Norman for his last stop, he handed Norman a freshly printed leaflet. It read:

CALL WITH SOUTHWEST DIVISION: 8/13 @ 2pm (SMALL CONFERENCE ROOM)

His heart skipped exactly one beat, breaking in a cold sweat to the realization that he'd completely forgotten about his mandatory participation in his team's upcoming conference call. Gathering about a half-dozen spreadsheets and their accompanying expense reports, Norman went home in a hurry to recite, again and again, what he would say the next day.

The next day went by more slowly than anyone previous; the hours before the call progressed about as slowly as Norman the Cat did through his larger portion the night before. Norman considered calling in sick, but realized that with an increasingly rebellious cat at home, he still needed the break of his employment. Thus, he mustered all the enthusiasm and energy he could, and headed into the small conference room to gather with his co-workers.

Twenty minutes later, Norman, for a second, held a large grin on his face as he walked past the fleet of cubicles towards his own, though he promptly manipulated his cheeks as to display one that was more appropriately reserved. He had done it: he made the three consecutive statements he needed to express that there were, in fact, no anomalies to report in his expense sheets.

Feeling giddy for his accomplishment, Norman decided to treat himself for an after-dinner dessert by purchasing a candy bar from the vending machine adjacent to his desk. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4xfez4/norman_attends_a_conference_call/] createDate=[1471059675] score=[16] numComments=[1]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman goes fishing] author=[Douzeman] text=[Norman was on summer vacation this week. 
He did not like to travel like his coworkers did. 
Norman enjoyed his life here.

Norman was thinking about the job. Norman remembered last Christmas. 
His office had a small secret santa exchange.
He did not want to take part in it, but people insisted. 
Norman does not like to argue with people, so he caved in and accepted.
He got a painting set for Frank. Frank seemed okay with the gift.

Norman got a fishing rod from Helen. 
He remembered how she smiled while he opened the gift.
He liked to see Helen smile. He thanked her for the gift.

This morning, Norman went in his garage and looked at the rod. 
He thought maybe he'd go fishing today. He had never done that before.
But he took the rod and went to the lake.

There were other people fishing. He chose a spot not too close from anybody else.
He had no trouble casting his rod. He read the manual before. Norman was proud.
He did not put a bait on his line. He thought he did not want to alter nature's course.
He just liked being at the lake, on vacation. 

He enjoyed thinking how Norman would love to see those fishes in the lake.
But Norman knew it was not a good idea to bring his cat here. 
He could fall in the water, or get ticks. Norman realised it was a good thing he left norman at home.

Norman was trolling slowy. Then casted his rod again. He liked the sound the weight did when it entered water.
"Plook". "Plock". It was similar, but different each time. 
At the end of the afternoon, Norman went back home.

He thought maybe next week, he'll tell Helen about his fishing day.
Maybe that will make her smile.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4w052p/norman_goes_fishing/] createDate=[1470279139] score=[16] numComments=[8]>

Now he lives his life in a simple routine, the monogamy reminds him of the military.

Norman was perplexed. Not only was Jan, a man he said 'hello' to at least once a month on the days that the nearest water cooler would run out and Norman would have to use the one across the office, but Eleanor was retiring too. Norman was a lot closer to Eleanor than he was to Jan, but Jan was also a very emotional person, if his intimate Christmas cards he sent out annually were any indication. Jan would be too hurt. *Why are you so inconsiderate, Norman?!* Norman thought ruefully to himself.

Norman opted for eating out for lunch today. If he had to choose between making one friend happy or the other, he would rather everyone suffer equally.

He reached into the pen drawer. He pushed aside a sea of fine points, brushed away a box of felt tips, and when he found what he was looking for he seized it almost reverently.

Back at his desk, he uncapped the medium point pen and marked his initials on the sales order. Relived at the smooth, thick flow of ink, he capped the pen and set it down, eager for the next chance to use it.

</thread><thread title=[Norman catches the train] author=[lagerdalek] text=[Norman sat on the train, on a rainy Tuesday night

He had worked late that day, after his PC had crashed and he had had to wait an hour for a temporary replacement laptop to finish the reports for the weekly sales managers the following morning.

It was passed Norman's dinner time, and he was picturing his cat swishing his tail at the door, waiting for him in carefully practiced nonchalant passive aggressiveness.

He looked out the rain splattered window, as the lights of the business district slowly slid past his vision. Norman felt a strong depression grow in him, at the impersonal nature of the scenery, all corporate logos, garish neon, and shiny models with perfect teeth, plastered many feet high.

Suddenly a thought struck him; every one of those logos, every one of those posters, every bright vision of colour was designed by someone, had obsessed someone as they were deep in creative design, someone had eventually looked at their creation with pride in their chest, and pointed it out to their children whenever they past it. 

There was nothing impersonal about the scene, it was all deeply personal, the clutter of the best work from a globe of corporately sponsored motely artists, models and photographers.

Norman knew this happy epiphany would pass in a couple of minutes, but he allowed himself to glow in it for a few moment before standing up for his stop.

As he stepped out onto the platform, he trod in a puddle, and soaked his trouser cuff.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5x8twk/norman_catches_the_train/] createDate=[1488550873] score=[17] numComments=[3]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Goes On A Diet] author=[rcgy] text=[Today was the day.


Norman had tried diets before, but they never stuck for long; probably because Norman was as weak willed as a man who was easily convinced. Norman had seen the ad on television three weeks ago, and made a promise to get around to starting the diet. Each week, he put it off for one more week, reasoning with himself, until one day, he put his foot down, and said to the bathroom mirror “this is for Norman. He needs to be cared for as best as I can do. Do it for Norman.” His reflection looked back at him, unconvinced.


The bright colors of the fad diet had called out to him each Thursday, when he did his weekly shopping trip. Norman reasoned that normal people would either shop at the start of the week, or at the start of the weekend, so he would be beating the rush by doing it on Thursday. What Norman failed to account for was that not everyone shared his pathological lust for routine. He'd never find out that Tuesdays are just as busy as Mondays at the supermarket, because he'd never deviate.


'A pity', Norman thought to himself as he browsed the scary new diet food for a reason to not go through with his promise, 'that Thursday is shopping day. The others at work have a Thirsty Thursday that I could go to if it wasn't held on Thursdays.' Norman didn't really think it was a pity though.


Picking up a surprisingly heavy can, Norman added it to his cart, and sighed. Looking at the tin, he remembered why he was doing this, and whispered “Do it for Norman.” to himself. Norman smiled, and wheeled the trolley to the checkout area. He was almost excited about the diet. He thought about standing on the wheels and riding it, and got a rush of adrenaline from the thought. He was worried that the checkout lady might say something when she picked up the 'new' purchase, but she did not. 


At home, he went over the instructions on the tin, and then opened the lid, and put it on a plate, tossing the can into the bin. 

It didn't look very appetizing. 

Norman retrieved the discarded tin from the bin in case he forgot a step, but he didn't. He sighed, and put the plate down, and washed his hands.


Norman looked at the strange new food apprehensively, and took a small bite from it. It wasn't very good; Norman scrunched up his face, and then meowed.


‘Oh well,’ Norman said while reaching for the regular cat food, ‘you at least tried it this time’.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5jowm7/norman_goes_on_a_diet/] createDate=[1482413640] score=[15] numComments=[0]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman confronts religion] author=[fearthemud] text=[Norman made his way up the small pathway leading up to the church’s front doors. As he entered the building he was reminded of his experiences with church when he was a child. He remembered his mother dressing him up in his “Sunday best” only to then sit down for a few hours singing hymns he did not really understand. Norman looked down at his current business casual attire and felt a little worried that he wasn’t dressed properly. He brushed aside the thoughts after seeing a couple walk out wearing regular casual clothes.

Inside the church tables were set up around the perimeter of the rectangle-shaped main room. Each one had a variety of delicious-looking pastries, cookies, and other baked goods for sale. Two women who he assumed were affiliated with the church stood at a main table near the back with a small jar labeled “Donations - Any amount appreciated!” 

He decided to pick up two small boxes of cookies and a tasty looking red velvet cake. Norman couldn’t remember the last time he had red velvet cake and felt excited in anticipation.  

The women at the table smiled brightly at his selections as he made his way over. 

“I just made that cake last night, great choice!” one said after Norman set everything down. 

“It looks amazing!” Norman remarked with a smile. After placing a $20 bill in the donation jar he said “Thank you” to both women before making his way back to the car. “Thank you, have a great day!” they called after him. 

He secured the treats in his backseat and made his way home. Norman hoped his co-workers would enjoy the treats tomorrow when he brought them in to work.

As he was driving home a careful 25 mph, Norman noticed that the animal shelter was particularly crowded today. He pondered a bit and decided his usual online Solitaire would have to wait. Norman pulled over to see what all the hubbub was about. 

Hands in his pocket, Norman swiftly walked over to the crowd, hoping to overhear something that would indicate why the shelter was particularly crowded today. After a minute of careful listening, Norman realized the shelter was giving away free animals. He wandered inside to take a look for himself. 

"Here to bring home a new friend?" One lady asked him who worked there. 

"Well, I just noticed the shelter was particularly crowded today, so I thought I'd see what was going on." Norman explained then quickly turned away and started looking at the animals. Norman noticed one cat who reminded him of Norman. Norman was about to reach in and pet the cat but he hesitated. There wasn't a sign that forbade the sticking of fingers in the cages but he thought it would just be safe to avoid any unnecessary altercations with the staff.

"Maybe Norman wants a friend?" He told the cat. The cat just purred against the cage. However Norman realized that HE was Norman's friend and figured that was all he needed. 

"Goodbye little cat" Norman said to the cat as he turned to leave the shelter.

He walked home with his apples, wondering if he made the right decision or if he should have helped her, and if she would have appreciated his chivalry.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4qmvmp/norman_panics_about_helping_a_mom/] createDate=[1467336333] score=[13] numComments=[0]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman gets ripped off by a food truck] author=[MillinerJones] text=[Today at work, Norman's office was buzzing with anticipation about the special occasion: management had declared the third Thursday of each month to be Food Truck Day, and had invited several local food trucks to park outside the office building for lunch.

.

Everyone was excited for the food trucks, including Norman. He had elected to skip packing himself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and instead brought with him a five dollar bill with which to buy lunch from a food truck.

.

As lunchtime came around, there were three trucks outside the building: one selling hot dogs, one selling tacos, and one selling ice cream. As he was looking over them, Norman chuckled to himself at the thought of ice cream for lunch. Norman walked towards the trucks, debating between hot dogs and tacos.

.

"Hot dogs," he thought, "are always a classic. Especially with ketchup and mustard." Suddenly Norman looked down and remembered that he was wearing a white shirt. The idea of a ketchup covered hot dog no longer appealed to him. 

.

Norman approached the taco truck and looked at their menu. Tacos came by the pair, and, for $3.99 he could get chicken, pork, or chorizo tacos. For $4.99 he could get two different varieties of tacos as a combo. Norman thought that they could have worded their combo a little better. He also wished that they would have put a description of each taco on the board, as he had no idea what a "chorizo" was. Norman settled on a pair of chicken tacos and approached the man working the truck.

.

"Hello," Norman said. 

"Good afternoon," the truck worker replied.

"I would like the chicken tacos please" Norman told the man.

The man nodded and disappeared into the truck. A short while later he reappeared with a pair of chicken tacos.

"That'll be $4," the man told Norman.

Norman reached for his wallet and pulled out his $5 bill. He thought it odd that the man said $4, yet the menu advertised the tacos as $3.99. He handed the man the $5 bill. The man set the tacos on the counter and went to the register. The tacos smelled delicious, and the man soon returned with a receipt and a $1 bill.

.

"Thanks, and enjoy the tacos!" The man told Norman.

.

"You too," Norman said automatically as he took his change, tacos, and receipt.

.

But Norman was too occupied looking at his receipt to notice his gaff. The receipt listed the tacos as $3.99, the money received as $5, and the change given as $1.01-- yet Norman held only $1! Norman looked up to the man to ask about the penny, but it was too late; the man was already busy with another customer. Reluctantly, Norman took his taco and his shorted change back to his desk. Though the taco was rather delicious, it couldn't overpower the bitter taste left in Norman's mouth after his poor experience buying tacos.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4ofsqd/norman_gets_ripped_off_by_a_food_truck/] createDate=[1466141520] score=[14] numComments=[1]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman visits his Aunt] author=[Question7NWantAnswer] text=[Norman was in store for a particularly big day. He was going to the retirement home to see his Aunt Ordinaire. 

*"It's been years since I've seen her,"* Norman thought as he was driving. 

He remembered the summers he spent at her house when he was a little boy. He would play fetch with her old dog, Ordinaire, tossing the ball very lightly so Ordinaire wouldn't get hurt. Aunt Ordinaire would bake him delicious cookies, raisin of course, and tell him amazing stories. 

As he was in the middle of reminiscing Norman heard his telephone ring. 

*"I better pull over and answer it,"* Norman thought

Norman safely exited off the road to the nearest gas station and parked perfectly within the lines. He then picked up the phone.

*"Hello,"* Norman said anxiously on the telephone.

*"Hello my wonderful nephew!"* Aunt Ordinaire said.

*"Hi Aunt Ordinaire!"* Norman lightened up a bit and felt more comfortable knowing he was talking to his wonderful Aunt. *"How are you doing today?"*

*"Norman, they want me to have surgery today in Normandale." she said.

*"Oh."* Norman said. Normandale was in the next state over. *"I guess this means we can't bake raisin cookies"*

*"I'm so sorry Norman,"* Aunt Ordinaire said. *But maybe you can come see me another time*

*"Yeah, another time"* Norman said.

*"Well I gotta go Norman, I'll call you when the surgery is complete"*

*"Yes, thank you Aunt Ordinaire for calling!"* Norman said.

Norman was disappointed that he couldn't see Aunt Ordinaire today, but he was happy that he would get to talk to her again tomorrow.

*"I'll talk to her tomorrow"* Norman thought as he began his drive home.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4n3hfw/norman_visits_his_aunt/] createDate=[1465392279] score=[13] numComments=[2]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman tries yoga] author=[TheMoveslikeCatullus] text=[Norman entered the bare dance studio. He smiled, then slightly grimaced at the sight of his stomach folding over his elastic waistband in the mirror. While he would've never found himself in such a place normally, he couldn't have said no to Lisa's invitation to a free trial at her yoga studio, and he *had* noticed himself looking a little on the chunky side. He was worried, though, because Lisa appeared to be absent today. It meant that he would have to place his mat next to a stranger who might have had a friend coming themself, putting them both in an uncomfortable situation where all participants wanted Norman to move, but it would've been exceptionally rude for any, including himself, to bring up the offer. 

No sooner had this worry passed than the instructor, bright eyed and very energetic for only 11:30 in the morning on a Saturday, quickly entered and called the group to come and sit on the floor, positioning themselves in the particular oval which left a few spaces too empty, and a few others too small. Norman wondered if he should try and scoot towards the elderly woman on his right, but decided that it would only alienate the man on the left.

The instructor began to speak.

"Welcome everyone to your first yoga class. *Namaste*. Now, I thought it would be a *wonderful* idea to begin this class with a little *icebreaker*!" She giggled to herself, then continued.
"Now, we're gonna play a little game called 'Wacky Words!' We're going to go around the circle, and when it's your turn, tell us your name. But, you have to make it fun by adding a word in front that describes yourself! So, for example, I'd say 'Hey everyone! I'm Funny Frankie!' And now you'd say..."

Beads of sweat immediately began to pop up on Norman's forehead. He quickly paged through the adjectives that popped through his head. Nasty Norman? No. Nude Norman? Big No. Nutritious Norman? Not the worst, but he'd be sure to get some awkward looks from Beautiful Betsy and Lovely Leah. Although it was awfully generic for a seasoned scrabble player like himself, he supposed that he would have to settle on Ni-

"-ce Nathan." Nathan, sitting to the left of Norman gave everyone a smile and a thumbs up. Norman, however, felt no relief, and he began to panic. All eyes were now on him. He could he feel his heart accelerating, blood rushing to his cheeks. *Say anything, anything at all* he desperately thought. He felt his mouth open; it was too late to stop.

...

It was the end of class. Norman hurriedly rolled up his sweaty mat under his arm, hoping to avoid anyone on his way out the door. However, his downturned  head and brisk pace couldn't avoid Nathan shouting out as he left "Good work today, *Naughty Norman*!"

A few days later, Norman opened a new email from the yoga studio about whether he would be returning past his free trial. He most certainly would not be.

</thread><thread title=[Norman doesn't want to cut himself.] author=[strng_skies] text=[Norman was waiting for his bread to finish toasting, and eating peanut butter out of a jar with a spoon. When the toast popped up, Norman considered using the spoon to spread butter on the hot toast. He thought about how the spoon might actually work, with the proper technique. He held the spoon purposefully before himself, and studied the form of the spoon and the musculature of his hand. 

"That hand is still a little shaky," Norman muttered. He often talked to himself. It was becoming a bad habit. "I should quit this muttering nonsense. I wouldn't want to get called a mutterer," he whispered.

 Mentally, and quite consciously, Norman continued his normal internal dialogue. "Spoons would be able to scoop out more butter than a knife. But that's not really a good thing, I don't want THAT much butter on my toast. And it's lacking the flat edge of a knife. A knife is definitely superior." 

Thought experiment having arrived at a plausible conclusion, Norman proceeded with confidence the preparation of his midnight snack. 

Norman lifted the toast to eye level, and leaned in to smell its carbon aroma. The knife felt cool in his hand, and the butter rested precariously on its sleek edge. Extensive experience gave Norman an eye for toast par-to-none (that he knew of), and he could tell this was about to be a solid 8/10 typically enjoyable experience. The bread wasn't too fresh and the butter wasn't too salty. Everything was perfect. 

Norman spread butter to bread using a razor-like motion that he invented himself. Norman held the bread against his cheek and proceeded to apply butter with a downward shaving motion, with precision that not even the finest barber could match for delicacy and taste. "Gotta watch that shaky hand, especially when I'm shaving." He gave a little laugh. "Don't want to cut myself. " 

He took a bite of the toast, and let the bread soak on his tongue until he felt the butter melt from the heat inside his mouth, and swallowed. It was such an intense experience, and Norman took pleasure from the sentimental ritual he had created, eating toast every night after dinner. But he had enjoyed the little meal, and squashed the guilt that appeared at the prospect of Norman actually enjoying himself. 

Sighing deeply, he noticed the bulge his stomach created in the glass of his back door. Shifting his gaze, he looked through them, and Lo and Behold, saw Norman looking right back at him! Norman rushed to let Norman in, who had probably missed its supper! Norman was standoffish the rest of the night, and ignored Norman until he went to bed, where he fell asleep next to him curled up on the covers.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4ju5cz/norman_doesnt_want_to_cut_himself/] createDate=[1463561987] score=[16] numComments=[3]>

The day's work had been particularly ordinary, and having rained all afternoon, normal felt a warm change of pace might relax him. As the kettle whistled, startling Norman from his perch atop the ottoman, Norman excitedly prepared his beverage. 
As the evening wound down, and the news for day began to cycle through again, Norman found himself yawning. "Better be off to bed, Norman" he says with a smile. After fifteen minutes of calmly laying, Norman found himself staring at the ceiling, watching the gentle sway of shadows from the trees outside on his ceiling. He also notices a small water stain in the drywall, and made a mental note of it to be fixed in the future. In his restless state, Norman couldn't help but worry about the following day's fatigue that would surely result from his caffeinated beverage. After several more minutes of contemplation, as his eyelids grow heavy, Norman decides to cut back on caffeine after he arrives home: he wouldn't want his personal life to effect his work performance, after all. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4cuawe/the_restless_mind_of_norman/] createDate=[1459520466] score=[13] numComments=[0]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman meets his neighbor] author=[thelurkingcat] text=[Norman had just stepped out for a breath of fresh air. He observed as his neighbor's front door opened and a large cat spilled out. "Mee-oow!" The orange ball of fur hollered as she raced down the steps, as though warning her human of her impending escape. She stopped at the bottom of the steps and began to snarf down the blades of grass at the edge of the sidewalk. She purred so vigorously while she was eating that Norman was sure he could hear her.

"Pig!" Norman heard his neighbor call to the cat. "Pig!" The orange Siberian paused to look up while she purred and chewed. She then chose to ignore her human, and when she'd caught her breath she resumed her vigorous eating. 

Norman watched, transfixed by the scene unfolding before him. He'd barely noticed he had a neighbor before. "Pig," he thought, bemused. "How does a cat get that name?"

Then the neighbor lady then quickly departed her front door, rushed down her front steps, and scooped up Pig. As she stood they made accidental eye contact. "Hi," she said quickly, and then just as quickly she looked away. Before he could introduce himself and inquire about the cat's name, and without so much as extending her hand, she turned and hurried back inside, carrying her pig-kitty over her left shoulder. "Meow!" Pig purred as the door closed.

"Hi Pig," Norman whispered to himself. "Nice to meet you too."] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4bzh55/norman_meets_his_neighbor/] createDate=[1458986249] score=[15] numComments=[0]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman avoids a potential mutually awkward encounter] author=[Lossoler] text=[Norman stepped with a mild hustle into the supermarket's public restroom. He had to pee, and quickly. Both urinals and one of the stalls were taken, so he would have to use the stall at the far end of the bathroom.

As Norman entered the stall, he was faced with a vexing issue - the lock on the door did not work, and the door would slowly open on its own. If it were the adjacent smaller stall, he could excuse himself just this once for standing against the door to hold it closed, considering his urgency, but this was the larger stall, and he could imagine a stranger walking into the open-doored stall, thinking it was empty, and seeing him. The humiliation might even - heaven forbid - force him to go to the competing chain a few blocks down the street from then onward to buy oatmeal (and frozen macaroni and cheese on Fridays), lest the stranger should see him again.

Norman decided in that moment, using his critical thinking skills, that holding it in until he could reach the bathroom on the opposite side of the store was a better decision than risk such embarrassment. How lucky his beloved Norman was that he was free from such stressful situations requiring snap decisions, but such was part of being a responsible adult.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5iz6b5/norman_avoids_a_potential_mutually_awkward/] createDate=[1482074446] score=[13] numComments=[0]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Sees Someone Through the Crack of a Bathroom Stall] author=[MattressCrane] text=[Norman began his lunch-break by taking a trip to the toilet. After stepping into the bathroom with a single stall and two urinals, Norman surreptitiously undid his pants and took a seat. Norman enjoyed his bathroom breaks; he was certain no one would ask him to file away some new T4 reports, nor ask him how his day was going. The social barrier of the stall door was the pearly gates that Norman had always dreamed of. 

A moment later, someone entered the bathroom. Norman held his breath. The footsteps sounded agitated- the other man wasn't interested in the urinals.

*He was interested in the toilet.*

Norman had hoped the man would see the locked door, leave the room, and check back in a minute, but no- the person paced back and forth, sighed, stood by the mirror, and waited, ever so patiently, for Norman to make a move. Norman couldn't do a thing under pressure like that. 

*Who would do this to me?!* Norman thought to himself in a panicked tone. He tried to peak under the stall to see the shoes of the other man. He knew that Andrew had recently purchased new orange sneakers, and was quite proud of wearing them, despite going against appropriate office attire. Norman bent down and saw the shoes- they weren't orange, as he'd hoped, but black, and scoffed. *Are those...*

Norman looked up to the crack between the stall door, and there, he made contact. Eye contact.

Quickly Norman's eyes flitted away, and the impatient man quickly left the bathroom. *It was Frank!*

Frank was Norman's cubicle mate. He should have known that the scoffed shoes were his! He saw them every single day!

Norman left the bathroom a moment later and returned to his cubicle. There, he saw Frank, quietly eating his sandwich over his keyboard. Black scoffed shoes leaned against the swivels on his chair. Neither man acknowledged each other.

Norman pulled out his own lunch, and began to eat, pretending that violating act had never taken place.. Maybe he should say something. It would spill into rumors eventually. Perhaps he should take hold of it while he can. Norman felt like the Monica Lewinsky of the office place.

Norman decided not to confront Frank- not today. He also felt too uncomfortable to eat his lunch beside him either. Norman carried his lunch into the bathroom and continued to finish eating it in the safety of the bathroom stall.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/55gsa6/norman_sees_someone_through_the_crack_of_a/] createDate=[1475410005] score=[13] numComments=[2]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman is Lonely] author=[MattressCrane] text=[Norman was trying to make new friends. The past ten years moved rather quickly, but painfully, like pulling off a band-aid over too much hair. Norman was ashamed of his friend circle. It amounted to a cat, a television set, and a cubicle mate named Frank who would say "good morning" a little too late in the day, usually right before lunch. Norman was desperate for companionship.

Luckily for Norman, he received an email from Andrew in sales. It was an invitation to drinks with a few of the other fellas from sales, and Eleanor from accounting, who's very popular in the office despite her dramatically-close-to-retirement age. Norman accepted the invitation.

However, Norman felt differently once at the bar.

"The pussy-cocker, Danny, *oh* makes me fuckin' livid!" shouted Tom to Andrew, with his back turned to Danny. The uproarious laughter failed to include Norman. 

It's not that the jokes or the conversations tried to not include Norman, no, it was quite open for Norman to join in whenever he pleased. However, Norman still felt distant, disconnected from his peers, and lonely. Lonelier than he ever felt sitting by himself in front of his television with no one but his cat.

Norman left The Pub early that night, only saying goodbye to Eleanor, as she was the only person to notice his departure.

The walk home only made things worse. *One step away from people, one step closer to a different kind of loneliness*, Norman thought solemnly. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4tjfch/norman_is_lonely/] createDate=[1468932405] score=[13] numComments=[3]>

Norman’s feet were throbbing as him and Claire approached the end of the scavenger hunt. It wasn’t really a scavenger hunt, since they were leaving items at locations, not taking them. A turtle figurine on the beach, a shot glass in a renowned bar, a flower in a graveyard. A dozen items were scattered across the island and Norman was feeling parched.

“This is getting quite boring,” Claire suggested.

“I agree!” Norman was waiting for that moment. He didn’t want to say anything, as it would seem that Norman was out of shape and not able to commit to the arduous five mile walk. “Would you like to get something to drink?”

Norman had recently heard about a new maple flavored Iced Cappucino offered at Starbucks. Originally it was a Tim Hortons exclusive, a Canadian coffee chain, but now its delicious flavour was being shared with the world.

“I was thinking that a Guinness would sound good right about now,” said Claire, “I feel like something cold.” 

“Sure. Can we stop somewhere on the way?” asked Norman.

“What’re you thinking?”

Norman just about said it. He knew it would be wrong, and slightly embarrassing if he went and bought a maple iced cappuccino before heading to a bar… 
“Have you ever tried a maple iced cappucino?” asked Norman. There was nothing wrong with that, nothing strange, just asking for an opinion. 
										
“I haven’t, but it sounds good. Maybe we could pick up one along the way to the pub?”

“If you’d like.” Norman smiled.

He was cautiously optimistic at the end of the work day because for the next two weeks Norman was going to be on vacation. It had been a while since Norman had actually taken a vacation so he was very excited. He looked at the time, 16:27. 

*Oh how exciting!* Thought Norman. *Only 33 more minutes and I will be on vacation.* 

Norman started to think about how much time he and Norman would get to spend together, and how Norman would probably sleep in a Sunbeam while Norman read the paper every morning.

 While Norman was daydreaming about vacation, Lisa came around the corner to his desk.

"Have a good vacation Norman! You work so hard you've earned it!" She said and continued on her way.

"Thanks Lisa! You too." He replied.
*Oh no,* thought Norman. *Did she notice I said 'you too?'* Norman was mortified. He looked down at the clock, 16:42. 

*Looks like I'll have to stay an extra 15 minutes to make up for this time I wasn't working*

Norman continued to work and resigned himself to be more cautious of wasting time at work and hoping Lisa did not notice his mistake in wishing her a good vacation.

After 3 rings, Norman let out a sigh and picked up the phone.

"Hello?" Norman said, a bit confused.

"Hello there, may I speak with Norman please?" said a man with a stern and powerful accent. 

"Uh, yes, you are speaking to him now. Um, may I ask who is calling?" Norman replied. 

"This is the American Red Cross, we want to thank you for your past donations. We were wondering if you would like to donate toward more causes..." said the man as he continued to discuss some horrendous disasters currently happening around the world.

Norman had a flashback of himself giving money 2 months ago at the grocery store to an elderly woman at a Red Cross booth. They must have gotten his number from the "thank you" paper she asked him to sign.

After a few seconds of not saying anything, Norman politely declined. He was not ready for this kind of commitment and did not ever expect a call from them... especially on a Sunday.

He put, the phone down gently and walked toward the kitchen counter to resume is breakfast task. 

"I hope they don't call me again... Will they call me each time I donate something?" Norman thought to himself as he poured the cereal in a white bowl.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4ofugk/norman_and_the_mysterious_caller/] createDate=[1466142149] score=[11] numComments=[0]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Plays Football] author=[Normanjnr] text=[Norman wasn't usually involved in sports, and couldn't wait to get started. "Finally time to have a go, better now than never" Norman thought to himself.  After failing to understand his work colleagues conversations about recent football matches he thought it would be a good opportunity to get caught up so he could involve himself with them.

With nobody to play with except himself Norman kicked off on his own, scoring numerous goals in quick succession. "I'm getting quite good at this" Norman quietly said to himself. Feeling confident with his new found abilities Norman found someone to play with. After a few hours of playing Norman had been quite successful, and had scored numerous goals. Norman checked the time and realised it was getting late, "Best stop now and catch an episode of CSI before bedtime" thought Norman to himself.

After a long day Norman turned off the PlayStation and put the controller back on the coffee table, feeling excited to talk to his colleagues tomorrow, he began thinking about what topics he could discuss the next day.

</thread><thread title=[Norman makes a salad.] author=[ch1k3n123] text=[A quick rummaging through the pantry was leaving Norman slightly disappointed. As he looked upon the shelves a throng of assorted junk foods and pastas gazed back at him. He stared, half dazed, half expecting to find a diamond in the rough, until his mind clicked.

Norman had bought a tub of Spring Mix salad leaves just a couple days earlier planning to make shakes. 

Grabbing the bottle of Ranch dressing he kept in the top shelf of his refrigerator Norman contemplated his options for toppings. Since salads was a new endeavor he decided to go simple. With his ingredients laid out on the counter Norman was ready to make his salad.

Norman thrust his hand into the salad mix and grabbed a fist full of the green and purple leaves. As he pulled his hand out of the tub some leaves dropped out on the floor. "Hmph", he grunted to himself. Norman realized there was nobody to share in his complete indifference to the surplus salad bits that fell on the floor. 

One light coating of Ranch dressing later and Norman was done preparing his salad. As he glanced at the pieces of salad left on the floor Norman sat down in front of the TV to begin his venture into the world of salad.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4cng0p/norman_makes_a_salad/] createDate=[1459409793] score=[12] numComments=[0]>

After the uncomfortable encounter with Josie, Norman felt ashamed for saying nothing, and now, a week later, he still hadn’t spoken to Frank either. Things had returned to the status quo, and for Norman, a man who tried his best to shut his front door quietly as to not disturb a sleeping cat, was partially relieved.

“Morning,” Frank said as he showed up for work, ten minutes late, per usual.

“Morning,” Norman said back. Then, Norman remembered.

“Oh Frank, I found your apartment key. From last week. I’ve forgotten to give it back until now, unfortunately.”

Frank swiveled his chair around to Norman, took the key from his hand, and solemnly turned back to his desk.

Norman wanted to say something positive, to regurgitate some sort of fun fact that he read. Nothing was coming to mind; only a story about insurance scamming in China. Norman hadn't forgotten the dire promise, but as time went on, Norman continually felt it was a fools errand. He didn't want it to be, but what else could it become? Perhaps if a scenario slapped him square in the face, Norman's courage would muster. Frank's hands rested on top of his keyboard, breathing calmly, staring nowhere. 

Norman said nothing, and returned to work.

Norman called for a taxi, after numerous hours of drinking with Frank and the patrons of The Pub. *It’s almost midnight,* Norman grumbled to himself. Norman’s knees wobbled like he had just climbed a flight of stairs, and Frank was, well, Frank was struggling to stand on his own. After a dozen shots, Frank seemed like a much younger man. More so like an infant requiring constant attention, but Norman didn’t mind taking care of the down-on-his-luck cubicle friend. It reminded him of his son Junior, back when Junior had no manners and said rude things to strangers on the street.

“Where’s your arm!?” Frank shouted at a one armed man on the sidewalk, “di-did it fall off!?” Norman hung his head to the ground and apologized more than he could count in this state. *At least four times,* Norman thought.

Norman was glad that Frank lived in the same apartment building as him, as it would only take a few seconds to reach his own door afterwards. Norman stood patiently as Frank ruffled through his pockets, looking for his keys.

“It’s in there somewhere…” Frank fussed. A minute later, the front door swung open.


It was Josie- Frank’s wife. Norman had never spoken to her personally. He hadn’t forgotten the promise he made to himself earlier in the evening.
	
“*For Christ’s sake Frank. You’re unbelievable!*” she whispered harshly.

“I do,” started Frank, speaking at full volume, “what I damn well please!”

“Who’s this?” she said, glaring at Norman. 

“I’mis cubicle mate, Norman,” Norman slurred. Josie flinched away as Norman stuck his arm out for a handshake.

“How come I never heard of you then, huh?”

Norman shrugged. He didn’t know what to say. He figured that he must’ve come up in conversation at least once, over the decade. *Apparently not.*

“Get in, Frank.” she said, grabbing her husband by the collar. The little frog in Norman’s throat became lodged, as his chance to speak up to Josie was lost. Norman stood in the hallway, regaining his composure. He saw Frank’s little key sitting on top of the welcome mat.

</thread><thread title=[Norman unwinds for the weekend.] author=[ReckoningGotham] text=[The alien feeling of unease had been wriggling in the back of his brain for a few weeks now.  He couldn't suss it out to fix it, which made it quite a frustrating problem.  Norman liked fixing problems.  He enjoyed dismantling things to their base parts to determine the cause of the issue and fixing it.  The fact that it was internal, however, made it all that much more irritating to Norman.

"Perhaps it's a wee bit of stress," Norman thought to himself as he bought some junk food from the convenience store on his commute home.  He had recently changed his diet to white meats and salads, along with fresh fruit.  While he didn't mind the new diet, he decided that he would treat himself to a small pint of ice cream and a candy bar over the weekend.  The new diet was in response to how sluggish he felt recently.  He couldn't pinpoint the cause of his frequent tiredness, and the doctor he went to had recommended he switch from his usual heartier meals to combat it.

He had two beers in the fridge at home and decided that, after he was sure his obligations were met for the evening, he would indulge himself with one.  He had made a mental checklist to ensure that he'd fed Norman, called Norman to ensure that he wouldn't be needing anything for the night (he didn't want to drive impaired), and ironed his clothes so he'd have a fresh start to the weekend.

The unease set in again, as Norman got into his car.  He drifted a little in thought as he made the short commute home.  He realized that was unlike him--he tried to very diligent in his driving skills.  When he got home, he couldn't quite remember what he was thinking about.

Two hours later, his clothes ironed, Norman purring happily after a little catnip and his evening munchies, Norman called his son.  The talk was brief, but not empty--Norman was doing quite well, and things were getting serious with his current girlfriend.  Norman hinted to his son and teased him lightly about hearing wedding bells, but dropped it after Norman started stammering a little.   

"All things in time, son." he said with a smile.

After the call, Norman was aware that he still hadn't figured out why he was feeling the way he was.  He grabbed his beer from the fridge and propped his feet up in his recliner.  Norman joined him.  

Fifteen minutes later, Norman put his mostly unfinished beer down.  It didn't seem to taste as good as he thought it would.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5rcaac/norman_unwinds_for_the_weekend/] createDate=[1485938627] score=[12] numComments=[0]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman is dead.] author=[Dotcor_Strangelove] text=[It was two weeks after high school graduation.  Norman was incredibly excited, as he had just received his acceptance letter from Ridgemont College.  The school was located two hours away, and he was due to leave in a week to get settled in with the business of renting his first ever apartment.


He said goodbye to his friends.  He played one last show with the Dusty Knucklers.  He walked through Knightshead Park one more time to see the rock that looked like a fist at the top of the hill.  He stood and looked at the town that he had grown up in and wondered if he'd ever be back again.


Norman left.  He studied hard and had little time for music.  He met a girl and fell in love.  He visited home sometimes, but rarely stayed long and never ran into any old friends.  Upon graduation, he found a job, bought a small house, and got married all in the same town he'd gone to college in.  After his parents died, he stopped visiting his hometown altogether.  Life had gotten in the way.


But long before Norman had stopped visiting, about a year after he first left for college, his mother had received a phone call from Roger, the bass player from the Knucklers.  He explained that the band was getting together for a show in a couple of weeks, and he was hoping to get in touch with Norman.  Norman's mom was sure he would be excited.


"Oh my, Roger!  Norman's just going to die!  He'll simply have a heart attack!"


In the garage, Roger solemnly hung up the phone and turned to the rest of the band.  The connection hadn't been great, but through the static he'd gotten the gist of the call.  "Boys," he began.  "Norman died.  It was a heart attack."


Two weeks later, they dedicated their show to the memory of the best damn keyboard player any band could hope for.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5gyuok/norman_is_dead/] createDate=[1481128616] score=[12] numComments=[4]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman feels temptation and exitement] author=[kokkelo90] text=[
Norman woke up to the sound of his alarm clock. He was still a bit tired so he decided to turn the light on for a while before getting up. His eyes took a few seconds to adjust to the light and he used that time to think about his life while he was still in bed. “Oh well”, he thought to himself and rose to sit on the bed. He looked at the socks he had put beside his bed the night before. “Maybe I could wear the same socks today I wore yesterday” he thought to himself. There was practically no reason not to, he thought. He had changed socks after showering late in the evening so they were not dirty. Not really.  Norman felt a sudden chill going down his spine. He looked at the socks and took them in his hands. He watched at them inquisitively. 

Suddenly he recognized them. He had bought these socks from a sale few months ago. It had been a moment’s decision to buy them because they were not his usual brand but higher valued one on a sale. He had had a fleeting troubling feeling on the register when he was buying them, like stepping above his place. He had felt like he was asking for trouble buying these socks, clearly made for people far more exciting than him. Like teachers or judges or salesmen.



Norman looked at the socks. He felt dreadful. “When do I learn?” he thought to himself. Norman gathered all his mental strength and stood up. The socks would have to go to the laundry bin. Norman took the socks carefully to the laundry bin and sighed from relief when they were under its hood.  He went back to his bedroom and dressed up in clean clothes feeling both relived and exited. He still still felt the tremors of excitement of winning his temptations while eating breakfast.  His day at work went fast and when he went to bed that evening he contemplated to himself what had occurred in the morning. “What a day!” Norman was proud of himself and fell asleep smiling.

</thread><thread title=[Norman's watch] author=[Nambot] text=[Norman sat in the tree of his metaphorical kingdom. He observed the large flat lawn, recently cut with that lovely smell still wafting into his nose. It was a delightful smell, but for now Norman had need to observe. Norman turned his head to the side. He could see the flowers at the edge of his lands border, he could see the patch of soil recently dug, and he admired all that was his from his lofty perch.

He looked the other way and from his height he could see into the street. He could see other flowers, other trees, not part of his kingdom, though Norman could only one day hope for it. He could see people moving around, as well as that horrid ginger cat that lived in the house opposite. Norman did not like that cat, at all, and it was evident from all the hissing and swiping that the ginger cat hated Norman too. 

As the ginger cat began strutting around, Norman got down from the tree. He was bored of admiring his kingdom now. Plus he was hungry. Sitting by front door, Norman meowed loudly until his human servant came to see to his needs. Norman liked this human, he would provide food when asked. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/57nw9k/normans_watch/] createDate=[1476591598] score=[11] numComments=[0]>

</thread><thread title=[The Norman Copy Firm] author=[Flopdy] text=[Six days a week Norman would wake up at 7 a.m., drink a cup of coffee, eat two peanut butter sandwiches and take a shower to get ready for work. If he were quick enough he’d have some time left to listen to the news on the radio. To get to his work he’d almost always take the bus, which was quite convenient because the bus stop was right in front of his work.

Norman worked at a small and local print shop called ‘The Norman Copy Firm’. He guessed he liked working there, and he felt like it was his duty to manage the printing machines. Sometimes though he’d wildly dream that he would be floor manager at ‘The Norman Copy Firm’, even though there was no such position. And if there were, it probably wouldn’t be available. Or he fantasized that he would someday have his own print shop, although he was unable to think of another name than ‘The Norman Copy Firm’.

But the dreaming he did was only on the days when there wasn’t much work to do, or on Sundays, when he was free. Norman never had the time to dream when it was busy. And his job mostly was busy, especially on Tuesdays and Thursdays for some reason. Norman didn’t know what the reason for that was though.

After a hard day’s work Norman almost always went home. Except for today. Never before did Norman feel like doing something other than going home straight after work. On this lovely and clear Friday noon he realised something; that his routine felt too repetitive. Norman wished for more unexpected things to happen in life. This was a new and unimaginable feeling he thought he had never experienced before and this excited Norman. Not visibly though, as Norman was quite a reserved man.

As he was closing up the shop he tried to speak to his boss. He never spoke to his boss. Then he just did it. Norman had a slight tremble in his voice and told his boss: ‘Mister Norman, I have worked for over 9 years at your firm, sir,’ and Norman, Norman’s boss interrupted him ‘Yes Norman I know, now would you mind cleaning the toilet now? I had chipotle yesterday. Somebody ought to clean the toilet.’ Norman was disappointed he couldn’t finish his sentence. He had wished that he and Norman would grab a beer or a coffee after work. He didn’t expect to work overhours.

Because of this trio of events, a party was planned for the lunch hour. Norman wasn’t particularly interested in being at the party this day, since he usually celebrates Groundhog Day privately, but the party was mandatory.

After everyone sang happy birthday to Eleanor and Robert, a silence hung over the group. In a neat circle of fourteen people, not one person dared mingle. Norman chewed the chocolate cake slowly, being sure not to be the first person to finish. Norman coughed to clear his throat.

Everyone turned to Norman. It seemed like he had nothing to say.

He didn’t have anything to say.

“There was this time…” Norman started. He didn’t know why he said that- the pressure of the group made Norman panic, and the result was a story that Norman didn’t know how to tell.

The room leaned forward, slowly crushing Norman against the watercooler.

Norman took a bite of chocolate cake, a large one.

He stared at his feet in shame.

The party returned to the silence.

</thread><thread title=[Norman drops acid] author=[Mr_Snufalafogus] text=[It was a normal Saturday afternoon, Norman had woken up a little early as he had been planning this day all week. He got out of bed and noticed his cat, Norman, standing at his bedside table almost as if knowing of what his owners plans were. Norman reached down and patted his friend, "It's alright Norman, I overheard Lisa talking about this at work and it seems exciting. I know it can be dangerous but as long as I follow her instructions everything should go according to plan." "Mrrrp" replied Norman almost seeming exasperated by his owners rash decision making. Norman readied himself for the day and left the house to retrieve what he needed.

He returned many hours later as it had taken him longer than expected to find what he needed. Norman entered his home holding two bags full of supplies. As he shut the door one of the bags caught on the door and ripped open spilling its contents onto the floor and rug. Norman yelped as he saw that one of the bottles' lid had broken and its contents were spilling onto the rug. He quickly rushed to clean up the mess as the harsh smell of lemons filled his apartment. He picked up the bottle and read "Citric Acid: Great for your next fish fry!" Norman sighed as he looked at the other contents he had dropped, luckily his carpet was fine but the new mini fryer he had bought was in pieces. It was the same model that Lisa had and had taken him all day to find. "Well it looks like this fish is fried." Norman said without realizing his own wit. "No fish tonight." he stated to Norman who looked disappointed, yet relieved. Norman knew his owner was much to clumsy to cook with scalding hot frying oil.

When all the cleaning was complete Norman slumped into his recliner. He had managed to pick up everything but there was one thing he could not remove, the harsh smell of lemons in his abode. He turned on the TV as Norman pounced into his lap. Patting Norman's head he chuckled to himself and said, "I don't think I'm ever going to drop acid again." He sniffed he freshly zested home one last time and tuned himself into CSI.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4wdrtm/norman_drops_acid/] createDate=[1470476042] score=[12] numComments=[0]>

Norman was intoxicated. So was Claire, but not so much as Norman. Together, the two spent the last five hours drinking and talking at a pub. They talked of nothing at all, a topic that Norman was well versed in, and despite Norman having trouble even saying “Good morning!” to the secretary back home, he found everything was just effortless with Claire. Something was burning inside of him that he hadn’t felt in years. *Maybe that’s the rum,* Norman thought to himself. 

The two headed back for the hotel past dark; Norman leading her by the hand. Norman had a lovely evening, but he knew it was well past his time for sleep. Norman planned to have Claire back home within the hour, and have himself nursing this hangover to be soon after in the safety of his four star hotel room. The world was trying to knock Norman’s butt to the ground and he would not be having it.

“Thanks for the evening once again, Norman.” Claire said calmly, and drunkenly. “Would you like some coffee?’

Norman was drunk- but not stupid. Of course he knew that coffee was a bad idea at this time of night. What is she thinking? Norman thought. Drunk people have the darndest thoughts. Norman’s throat was rather parched, however, and after the maple cappuccino he had earlier in the day, he certainly had a hankering for more. He also had a hankering for pizza, and perhaps with another beer he would feel like Chinese food. Norman knew very well his level of sobriety.

“I could have a cup, I suppose.” Norman stated. Claire smiled, and pulled the middle aged man by the shirt collar into the room. The door clicked behind.

</thread><thread title=[Norman's Trip to the Community Center] author=[baween] text=[[Table of Contents](https://pineapplestation.wordpress.com/the-apotheosis-of-norman-chronology-table-of-contents/) for This Norminal Life:
___
“Sheldon P. Wembly Memorial Hall” read the tidy broze plaque affixed to the door. Internally Norman was terrified. Inside the hall were formica tables and fold-out chairs scattered like seeds on the heavily-glazed brown of the hardwood floor. Swooping lines and circles on the floor told Norman that the room also doubled as a room for indoor sport. At the end of the hall on a small counter sat an old kettle and a bowl of teabags. Here was where his rusted Euchre skills would be put to the test.

Gladys had already set to chattering with folks waiting for their fourth player to arrive, holding a steaming Styrofoam cup and shaking with laughter. Norman and Gladys’ opponents had yet to arrive. What surprised Norman was the distribution of ages. There were people Norman’s age; a teenager was staffing the tea and coffee bar. This wasn’t so bad, Norman thought to himself. So far.

Before too long Norman and Gladys’ opponents arrived. Burkes was Gladys’ age but stood nearly a head taller than Norman and had a voice like a church organ. His nephew Jonathon, a smaller chap probably around Norm’s age stood to introduce himself. Hoping to avoid awkward silence, Norman offered to grab his opponents something from the counter.

“Thanks, Norman. I’d like some water”. The depth of Burkes’ voice reminded Norman of when his mother dragged him to church as a boy. Walking from the counter after thanking the acne-riddled teen, Norman thought about his old church and its massive pipe organ. It seemed omnipotent when Norman was a child, a gaping maw of unimaginable power that in theory transported its listeners to holy thoughts. Norman hadn’t gone in years but that deep timbre never stopped ringing in his soul.

As tricks and hands came and went Norman settled into routine. He had definitely made some bad plays here and there but the gentle teasing from the rest of the table didn’t sting like Norman thought it would. He learned more about his opponents and discovered that Burkes, like Norman’s father, had served in the war before quitting the Army. When Norman mentioned the commonality with his father Burkes asked if Norman’s father had said anything.

He hadn’t. In fact, Norman remembered his father to the table as a silent, sunken figure. He had never really gotten through to his father before he died. Before Norman sank into melancholy Gladys piped up about her father, an officer in the Navy who smoked a pipe and told fantastic tales of his time at sea. To have believed him Gladys’ father had fought the Kraken, repelled pirates, saved princes and princesses, delivered royal messages, and done all that before breakfast. They had a good laugh.

As they folded up their chairs Jonathon asked if Norman would be back next week. “But what about Gladys’ partner?” Norman was worried – he couldn’t supplant that person!

“It’s okay, Norman. I finally convinced uncle Burkes to come out”.

Norman looked forward to next Saturday.

</thread><thread title=[Norman´s tequila glasses] author=[theghostofchetbaker] text=[For a month or so Norman´s kitchen sink was severely clogged. He couldn´t wash his dishes without flooding the sink. To address this issue, he decided to give priority to the things that should be washed with urgency vs the ones that could remain dirty for a while. He decided to clean the glasses first because naturally thirst is more dangerous than hunger. After cleaning them, the sink filled itself with dirty water and food leftovers; the water was no longer running through the drain.
He then decided that, to avoid flooding the kitchen, the stagnant  water should be transported from the sink to the toilet. Because all the large glasses were already clean, he had to use the small tequila glasses. 
This went for a while. 
He was happy because finally he got a chance to use his tequila glasses for the first time. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4geyuv/normans_tequila_glasses/] createDate=[1461641315] score=[13] numComments=[1]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Gets Stuck in Traffic] author=[SloppyJoeVP] text=[It was an ordinary Wednesday evening, and Norman was stuck in traffic as he made his commute home. Norman didn’t really mind traffic. He figured everyone was trying to get somewhere, and that getting stuck in traffic was inconvenient for them all, so he never complained or honked his horn. 

Eventually Norman passed the cause of the holdup: a truck had veered off of the road, probably avoiding an animal. Maybe even a cat. Norman became anxious, his mind racing. *What if it was Norman? Did I leave a door open? Could Norman have climbed out of a window?* Norman thought. His negative thoughts persisted until he was finally able to make it home, paying attention to all traffic laws as he went.

Norman burst through the front door and was filled with relief to see Norman sitting on the couch in his living room. Norman ran and gave Norman a great big hug. He never found out why, but Norman was given an extra large helping of cat food that evening.

</thread><thread title=[Norman hears a creak.] author=[Bloodsail_Admiral] text=[It was a Friday night, and Norman went upstairs, exhausted. He had decided to stay up an hour later than normal, watching a rerun of CSI, and he was really feeling it now. When he arrived into his room, he took off his glasses and went to bed. After getting under the blankets, Norman reached over to his bed side lamp, and turned it off.
	
Norman’s mind wandered, and he found himself thinking strange thoughts, as was semi-typical as he drifted off to sleep. He imagined buying Norman a new brand of cat food, and chuckled sleepily to himself.
	
All of a sudden a creak pierced Norman’s sleepy haze, jolting him into full consciousness. It had come from the doorway, and it went from being cracked to there being enough room for someone to stick their head through. Norman squinted his eyes at the doorway, praying for it to be just a draft.
	
Norman jumped onto the bed, startling Norman. Norman walked over to Norman’s face and began nuzzling against it. Norman’s heart eased.
	
“I love you, buddy.” Norman whispered quietly into the darkness.

</thread><thread title=[Norman hears a noise] author=[Voodoopie] text=[It was about fifteen minutes into the first rerun of CSI that Norman heard it. A strange noise. It was a deep whistle followed by a slight moan. 

Norman's heart leapt into his throat, and his whole body had gone numb. Was that a text message? Is the air conditioner broken again? Oh dearie me, what is going on?

As these thoughts raced through Norman's head, he was forced to mute his rather exciting episode to hear better. 

After a moment of strained listening, Norman realised that Norman was asleep in the washing basket atop a stack of clean laundry snoring rather loudly.

Norman chuckled at his moment of foolishness as he wiped off the beads of sweat that had formed during this escapade. 

Returning his neatly folded, plaid handkerchief to his top right pocket and not wanting to disturb Norman's rest any further, he decided to head to bed early himself. All this excitement had Norman drained, and he did have work tomorrow after all. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5u774l/norman_hears_a_noise/] createDate=[1487192461] score=[11] numComments=[1]>

He had to listen to a team-building seminar, during which him and all his coworkers heard about the virtues of leadership from a very nice young lady. Norman listened to her words, but he had been told the same thing countless times in different ways. He quietly sat until the seminar was over, peaceful; save for when some of his coworkers were whispering (which slightly irratated him). Can't you see the lady is speaking? After it was over he was handed a lanyard. This would make a good toy for Norman, Norman thought. When it wrapped up, people began to quickly crowd the exit of the hall, trying to leave as fast as possible. Some even went out the "emergency exit only" doors, but no alarm sounded. Norman wanted to go home, but it was worth waiting to avoid the push and shove. He looked at the lanyard.

</thread><thread title=[[Long] Norman signs up for a movie rewards card] author=[PhiliDips] text=[One quiet afternoon in the office, Norman received an e-mail from his co-worker, Jerry. 

&gt; Hey, everyone! David, Megan, and I have been talking, and we've decided to invite the entire office to go see the new movie, "Hoard of the Dragon Queen". We'll be going to the CineMovie location, on 19th street. The movie will be on the 25th of November, showtime at 7pm. Get there early to snag some good seats!

Norman was, at first, disgruntled by the use of professional e-mail to organize such a casual event. However, he was a fan of the "Dragon Queen" comic series as a teenager, and was intrigued as to how it would look as a film. As Norman pondered this, it occured to him that he could save some money by signing up for a movie rewards card. He checked his watch. His finance report was finished, and lunch was in seven minutes. "I have time," thought Norman.

He logged on to the CineMovie rewards website, and clicked the "sign up button". While the page was loading, he pulled out his phone and his wallet, and put them on his desk, in case he needed to get an app or give some debit card information.

He put in his name, his address, P.O. box, zip code. When it asked for a security question, he chose "name of pet" and entered "Norman". He smiled at the fact that Norman would be a part of his CineMovie account.

When he was finished, he was asked whether he wanted to get the app or print out a temporary card before he could get a plastic one. To be on the safe side, he went for both. He installed the app and signed in on his phone. He then printed out the card, speed-walked to the printer, and speed-walked back. He then cut out the card and put it in his wallet.

As he logged out of the website and printed his report, it occurred to Norman that he had broken a rule by using the office computer for personal use. He had seen Jerry get in trouble with the guys at IT for doing so. Suddenly, the lunch bell rang. As he sauntered out of his cubicle, he crossed his fingers, hoping he wouldn't have a run in with IT.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5du76l/long_norman_signs_up_for_a_movie_rewards_card/] createDate=[1479614163] score=[11] numComments=[0]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman feels a little weird.] author=[ReckoningGotham] text=[He was unsure, really, what the problem was.  He got up at his usual time, showered and shaved (he lost a little of the hot water a bit early but he truthfully didn't mind).   His breakfast and morning commute were very satisfactory.  

He just had a bit of a feeling.  He pushed it aside, so as not to waste company time, and figured he'd ruminate on it over his lunch break.  He worked diligently and achieved a normal amount of productivity.  His coworkers were cordial with him, and he was back.  Judith, the new intern, cracked a joke he found quite amusing while taking his files.

As lunch approached, he considered his meal--leftover takeout from last night.  He had had an odd craving and, while certainly high in sodium, decided to treat himself to a half-portion so as to save the rest for the workday.  He had been walking recently and figured a tad bit of junk food was fine so long as he didn't overdo it.  

Lunch arrived and and Norman waited to use the microwave.  Judith was there, twiddling on her phone, waiting for her boyfriend to call back.  He told her that her joke was quite funny, and asked her what she was eating.  It was beef stew, apparently.

Normally, Norman very much enjoyed hearing about others' lunch--he was quite a crock pot enthusiast, but today, it didn't seem to interest him, and he thought about how...off-kilter he felt.  He told himself that he would reflect on it over lunch, and decided to do just that.

Norman dedicated his entire thought process to it.  

"Healty mind, healthy life," he thought to himself as he went down the list of things that could have given him just a little bit of stress.  His finances were in order--he had recently set nearly all of his bills to be on auto-pay, which was quite a relief and added about an hour to his week of just free time.  He felt healthy, he thought, no aches or fever.  His pets were clearly healthy.  

With no solution to his feeling of unease, Norman figured he might just be having an off day.  He finished his meal and discarded his notebook pad, scribbling out the contents so that no one snooping would worry.

He resumed work and finished out the day.

He got home, completed his routine, and decided to give Norman some extra attention tonight.  That was quite a proper distraction!  He had a store of catnip he rarely broke out but couldn't resist making Norman feel very cozy and safe.  He got quite a laugh about it.

Later in the evening as Norman settled in to his bed, the feeling of unease--like the idea that he had missed the bus, returned.

"Perhaps," he said quietly and out loud, "this feeling will pass by morning."] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5a3bir/norman_feels_a_little_weird/] createDate=[1477812843] score=[11] numComments=[1]>

Wine had always intrigued Norman, and he had plenty to spare after dinner preparations. Norman decided to pour himself a glass, and sipped it while he listened to some smooth dinner jazz he had put on while he cooked. "I used to be able to play trumpet," he thought, "but dad said college education was a better choice than playing music."

Norman put down his glass, Norman coming to sniff its unique scent licked the rim of the glass and laid next to it. "It was probably a silly thing to follow anyways," said Norman, aware he was probably buzzed on his drink and awaited the impatient beep of the oven. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/56vp5y/norman_enjoys_a_glass_of_wine/] createDate=[1476178987] score=[10] numComments=[0]>

At the bottom of the word document, there was a black dot, standing in clear contrast to everything around it.

At first Norman thought that a random period had been put into the document, so he scrolled down to deal with it, but noticed that it did not movie with the screen.

“Must be something on the screen.” Norman quietly muttered to himself as he reached up to scratch it off, but to no avail.

</thread><thread title=[Norman's change of pace] author=[Saddams_Zucchini] text=[Norman sat down with Norman to watch another exciting episode of CSI.  As he switched the TV to the correct station, something was wrong.  Instead of the final credits of the previous show, Norman stared in disbelief at the weatherman detailing a major storm halfway across the globe.  *This is ridiculous!* Norman thought.  He went to the TV guide station to see if anything other stations had his favourite show on.

There was no CSI on, but one station was playing CSI: Miami.  Norman had never seen CSI: Miami before.  *Perhaps the genius of Jerry Bruckheimer extends to both shows*, Norman mused.  A bit discontent with being forced to settle for something less, Norman switched to CSI: Miami anyway.

CSI: Miami was an absolute disaster.  Confused by Horatio Caine's one-liners and antics with sunglasses, Norman was unable to determine the tone of the episode.  He also found the blonde woman's accent annoying.  The episode was part one of a two-parter, but Norman would not stick around for the second half.

Despite only being 8pm, Norman had had quite enough nonsense for one day.

</thread><thread title=[Norman Gets A Haircut] author=[hipipop] text=[Norman had woken up to his usual morning routine. After feeding and petting Norman a little, Norman took a shower, got dressed for work, had his breakfast, and parted to the office. 

To no surprise, Norman's workplace was just as wonderful and dull as any other day, although one thing was very distracting to him. As he entered the office, Norman saw that Lisa's hair looked different. He pondered for a minute, trying to figure out what it was, but Norman decided to get to work as soon as possible and not waste valuable company time. 

Once lunch came around, and Norman finished his ham and cheese sandwich, he made his way to Lisa and said, "Hello, Lisa!"

"Hey, Norman. How's your day been?" Lisa responded.

"It's going well, thanks. What did you do to tour hair today? It looks great."

Lisa smiled, "I got a haircut, glad you like it."

"It looks wonderful. Well, I better get back to work."

The rest of the day, Norman couldn't stop thinking about getting a haircut himself. He kept chuckling at the thought of all the weird hairstyles he might get.

After work, Norman got home, set his briefcase down, went back outside, and walked to his local barber shop. Norman's journey ended just as it began though, as he looked at his reflection on window to a bakery on the way there. He looked at his head and realized there was no hair to cut and no point in going to the barbers. Norman looked great anyways and decided that his walk to the bakery and back deserved a small prize.

Back at home, Norman sat on his couch, and Norman sat on his lap. He took out the cupcake from a bag and gave a small piece to Norman. He had forgotten about the haircut already.



I got my idea for my story from here:

</thread><thread title=[Norman Goes to the Beach] author=[SeaFortress] text=[&amp;nbsp; Norman awoke promptly at 8:30 am, and had himself a nice, hearty breakfast. It was a hot Saturday, and he was feeling excited – he was going to the beach. It was only an hour or so drive from his apartment, but he rarely ventured out that way, as he was usually content to spend the weekend relaxing with his cat (also named Norman) and watching CSI, but he had decided to shake things up a bit.


&amp;nbsp; After breakfast and a hot shower, Norman collected his beach bag, said goodbye to Norman, (“I wish I could take you!” Norman said, patting his head) and headed out to the car. The drive was uneventful, and he was at the beach within an hour. Norman parked his car, triple checked that it was locked, then set out to stake a spot in the sand.


&amp;nbsp; The beach was not as crowded as he had imagined it would be, and Norman got a nice spot that was close to the water – but not too close, of course. After spreading sun screen on himself, Norman set up his foldable chair, grabbed a book from his bag, and began to read.


&amp;nbsp; A few hours passed, and soon Norman was feeling a bit warm. He looked out at the water and started to venture out to walk on the shoreline, but he stopped himself – if he went to walk in the water, his wet feet would surely get sand stuck to them, which would be quite bothersome, and those hoses on the boardwalk never seemed to do a thorough job at cleaning it off. Norman decided that the walk would not be worth the trouble of getting sand stuck to his feet. He looked up at the hot sun, and at his chair, and then decided that perhaps it was best if he started home.

***

“You were married before,” said Frank, starting to heavily slur over his words, “right Norman?”

“A long time ago. We’ve been divorced since…” Norman tried to think of the day. He used to know it by heart. Norman forgot to realize just how long ago it was.

“You know… Let me tell you something Norman. Marriage is hard. I’m sure you know that. It takes so much damn work, and even then, does it mean it’s going to work out? No. No no no… It doesn’t.” Frank hung his head down until it was almost touching the counter. Norman tried to rub his back, but felt uncomfortable, and resorted to a quick slap on the back. Frank’s head sprung up.

“She wants to leave me, Norman.”

“Jeeze,” Norman huffed.

“And she wants to take my girl with her.”

“Oh jeeze,” Norman huffed again.

“I don’t know what I’d do without them.. That bitch is going to… Goddamn, Norman. God. *Damn.*”

Norman was at a loss for words. He wanted to console Frank, to tell him what he needed to do to avoid the same fate that Norman’s marriage had. But that was an answer to a question that Norman was never able to solve.

Quiet little whimpers came from underneath Frank as his head rested in the palm of his hands. At that moment, Norman made a promise to himself. While his own marriage was in the toilet, he knew that he couldn’t live with himself if this one went awry as well. He didn't know how he would do it, or if it was something that a small man like himself could ever solve in the first place. 

*I’m going to save your marriage, Frank,* Norman thought. *I promise.*

Though they were mostly okay, they were a little soggy and he'd feel hungry again by 3:00 PM.  Norman decided he wouldn't bring salads anymore, but would go back to sandwiches (with poultry instead of red meat) and would bring a small side of fruit to meet his new healthy-food requirement.  

But today he was going out to lunch!  Since his sandwich and fruit plans had been thwarted, Norman decided he would get one last pastrami sandwich with a side of potato chips!  There was a little cafe in the lobby of the building across the street from his office that made wonderful sandwiches.  Norman made his way over but was aghast when he saw how long the line was!  He wanted to be sure he had enough time to get his lunch, eat it, read a little from his book, and return to his office within the allotted lunch hour. The line for the sandwich bar was long, and the line for the cash register was even longer!  He would almost certainly never make it back by 1:15 PM. 

Norman noticed there were some pre-made lunches in the cooler near the register and thought that would be the safest option.  The only sandwiches left had spicy chipotle sauce, which he didn't think he should try for the first time right now.  Norman picked out a house salad with a balsamic vinaigrette dressing and stood in line to pay for his salad. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5i59vu/norman_goes_out_for_lunch/] createDate=[1481682977] score=[10] numComments=[2]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Enjoys a Song] author=[DuckTracy] text=[Norman was finishing his instant noodle cup when he spotted his neighbor out the kitchen window. It had been over a week since she moved in and introductions had yet to be made.

Norman plopped off the table and pranced his way over to the front door where he began to meow proudly. A large thud sounded and his back arched up.

Norman had recently took up a crossword book subscription and today was the day. He opened the door to collect his subscription but all that was there was the Community Paper. The Community Paper had crosswords in the back but Norman found them to be too pedestrian.

Norman knelt down to collect the paper and noticed his neighbor approaching. He quickly turned away and opened the paper.

"Hello" said a friendly voice not too far from him.

Norman flipped a page to feign reading.

"I just moved in next door and am making the rounds to meet everyone"

Norman stood silently with his paper. He could hear his neighbor's breathing begin to hasten.

"I...wanted.." she trailed.

Several moments later he heard her walk away. Norman turned and muttered to himself into the air,

"Some other time" before stepping back in inside.

Sitting down on the couch, Norman punched the keypad on his phone and dialed the crossword company. As he heard the waiting music chime in he decided to allow himself one leg to be stretched across the couch. He clicked his phone like he had learned from the manual and the music grew louder. It was one of those top songs that Norman Jr. liked. Norman cleared his throat and began to hum. The song looped over and a great smile formed on Norman's face.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5euscd/norman_enjoys_a_song/] createDate=[1480124990] score=[11] numComments=[0]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman struggles with storage] author=[rhowaldt] text=[Norman used his foot to push the front door shut behind him, his hands preoccupied with a grocery bag and a brand new plastic food storage container. He placed the stuff on the table and proceeded to unpack. He put everything away except for the storage container and a box of cornflakes.

Norman opened the cornflakes and took the plastic inner bag out of the packaging. To avoid making a mess he immediately threw the cardboard box in the bin. "I won't be needing that anymore!", Norman thought to himself. "I have my new storage container now! The days of old, soft cornflakes are over! No more air will be allowed to meddle with my flakes!"

Norman snickered at his own waggishness. "Let's give this bad boy a good wash before I put the cornflakes in!", Norman said. Norman gave an affirmative "meow!" from the sofa. Norman turned on the tap. He wondered whether more people disliked the taste of food from a brand new container. "Well, if they don't, they could surely give it a try sometime, and they will probably find it to be much better!", Norman said. Norman did not meow anything. "Or maybe not", Norman thought.

Norman dried off the container and set it down on the counter. He removed some soggy greens from the strainer and threw them in the rubbish. He washed and dried his hands thoroughly and grabbed the plastic bag of cornflakes. He carefully ripped it open and tilted it into the container. The flakes came sliding out, but Norman soon realised he'd made a mistake. There were too many cornflakes to fit the container.

For a moment Norman marvelled at his own idiocy. "So stupid", he thought, but he didn't say it. He didn't want Norman to hear. He figured his best course of action was to put only a part of the cornflakes in the container, and keep the rest of them separately. But Norman didn't want to keep them in just the plastic bag, which couldn't be properly closed. He needed the cardboard box to at least have a double wall.

Norman went to grab the old box from the rubbish, but found it with soggy greens splattered all over it. "Yuck!", Norman said. "Meow!", Norman said, from the table this time. "Get off the table Norman", said Norman. "Meow", said Norman. Norman sighed, and looked at the plastic bag half full of cornflakes. "I guess I have to eat them", Norman said. "Meow", said Norman.

And so he did, and skipped his dinner, and went to bed early feeling a bit sick. The next morning he did not have cornflakes for breakfast.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5b1kbh/norman_struggles_with_storage/] createDate=[1478261024] score=[10] numComments=[1]>

Norman knew that not many others shared his enjoyment of the crunch bread delights so he tried not to mention it too often.

Norman took a sip of water before eating the crusts so he could fully cleanse his pallet before eating them. Before he could even reach for the crusts Lisa came over and picked up his plate.
"Would you like me to throw these out for you Norman?" 
Asked Lisa with a helpful smile. Not wanting Lisa to know his oddity or decline her when she was being so friendly, Norman replied sheepishly,
"Yes please Lisa."

Norman got up as his lunch break was probably over soon and if it wasn't he wanted to get back to work anyway. As he sat down Norman sighed internally as not to annoy his co workers and thought how nice Lisa was to him.

</thread><thread title=[Norman cheats during a test.] author=[plokmijnq] text=[It was a Saturday afternoon, and Norman was sitting at a table in a well-ventilated room with 9 others, about to take an IQ test. He had his pencil and eraser arranged neatly at the top right of the table.

Norman fidgeted nervously, and decided to move his eraser a little to the left. He wondered how he would fare for the test. He also wondered what to feed Norman later.

The invigilator handed out the test papers, comprising 10 questions. They were told that they had 15 minutes for the test. Hand trembling, Norman picked up his pencil and began.

5 minutes before the paper ended, the invigilator got up and left the room. Norman thought he must be going to the toilet. Norman was halfway through the test.

Time ticked by, and soon, time was up. However, the invigilator was nowhere in sight. Norman still had 2 more questions to go. But, the time was up; he shouldn't be writing anymore. Norman glanced around the room, and saw that everyone had continued to write.

No, Norman told himself, I will not commit such a dishonest act. But he wasn't convinced.
 
After a minute passed and the invigilator still hadn't returned, the angel in his head was finally struck down, and Norman picked up the pencil and began to write. Just 2 questions won't hurt, Norman convinced himself. Or maybe it was the devil that convinced him. Norman didn't think he was capable of such an atrocious act alone.

The invigilator returned to the room suddenly, and Norman dropped his pencil in surprise. It rolled underneath the adjacent table. Norman decided he would take it after everyone was dismissed. The man at the table picked up his pencil and passed it to him.

Norman felt really guilty on the way home, so much so that he forgot to buy the can of cat food for Norman. Norman did not have any appetite to eat after that.

</thread><thread title=[Norman has an unpleasant morning] author=[D-va_Main] text=[One Wednesday morning, Norman was getting into his car to drive to work when he felt something was amiss. Not quite being able to place it, and not daring to risk the extra time thinking about it, he turned the keys and began his commute. He powered on his car radio at 6:48, knowing that that was when the morning radio had ended its introductions and gotten into the first round of songs. As he merged onto the highway he pinpointed the cause of his distress. His black pleather belt was fastened snugly in the 4th notch, one notch looser than he typically wore it.

This revelation plagued Norman his whole drive, and upon stepping out of his car and into the parking lot he momentarily considered adjusting his belt. His fingers slid across the cheap metal of the buckle before deciding against it. What if someone were to see him? What would Lisa think if she saw him unbuckling his belt? Someone like Lisa would never respect a man who made the silly mistake of not fastening his belt tight enough in the morning.

Norman spent the rest of his day feeling like a fool with a one-notch-too-loose belt.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/56k547/norman_has_an_unpleasant_morning/] createDate=[1476005878] score=[10] numComments=[2]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Buys Fireplace Utensils] author=[ligamentary] text=[Whilst perusing an outlet mall on an unrelated matter, Norman passed a store that sold exclusively fire place utensils. Intrigued by the specificity of the establishment, and having fifteen minutes to spare, Norman popped his head inside. 

A woman with greying red hair who clearly despised her job almost as much as she despised herself, welcomed him with a cheery, albeit scripted, greeting. Norman replied in kind. 

He looked at a variety of chimney brushes and compared different brands, prices, and qualities. 

A man serious about purchasing a chimney brush came crashing into the aisle and Norman decided to give him room. He continued on to a new aisle entitled "brass fireplace utensils". There was a brass log holder hearth that came with its own patent leather bellow, but Norman wasn't given to splurging on extravagant fabric accents. 

As Norman examined several fireplace stokers a salesman approached him and offered his hand to shake. "Sir, my name is Rick. Can I help you find anything?" To which Norman replied "Rick, my name is Norman. I very much respect what you all are doing in here, but I'm just in to browse, as I don't have a fireplace." They nodded a goodbye and Norman continued. 

Upon checking his watch Norman decided to err on the side of caution and make his way to his next destination with time to spare in case he became otherwise sidetracked along the way. So he left the fire place utensils store, only to ever return again one time, at an unspecified point in the future. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/55h3rq/norman_buys_fireplace_utensils/] createDate=[1475416543] score=[11] numComments=[1]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman in Traffic] author=[ligamentary] text=[The sun was just beginning to dip beneath the clouds ripe with rain as Norman made his way back from the conference 50 miles east of his home. He was just over the state lines cruising at an even speed when he saw brake lights begin to flash. He slowed his trusty beige hatchback Saab to a stop. 

Norman craned his neck out the window to try and determine the source of the congestion, but all he could see was trees and cars. Some appeared to be in park. With a sigh, he adjusted the radio to his favorite talk station and began to wait it out. He stuck an arm out the window and, with summer just beginning to freeze into autumn, decided against idling. He churned the key in the ignition with a mildly disconcerting grind. "It's just as well." Norman thought. "I only remember to recycle half the time anyways. This'll even it out." 

He adjusted his seat back and rested his feet on the dash, massaging his tight hamstrings. "I really should stretch more." He remarked aloud to nobody at all. Norman began to rest his eyes but decided against it, lest the traffic clear and he inadvertently furthered the delay. 

He reached in his glovebox hoping for some sweets or a stray chip from his rest-stop lunch hours earlier. To his surprise, a stale can of Fanta was hidden behind the car's operation manual. 

He popped the tab and took a long, unsatisfying drink. The sun said a final goodbye and with only the stars to warm him, Norman switched his car back on. "I should really stop buying name brand sodas. The taste isn't that different at all." Norman was pleased with this sensible choice, deciding to ignore the fact that he'd undoubtably forget about it the next time he went to the store. 

"I might as well cut through some work while I'm stuck here." He thought, this time to himself, instead of out loud. He fumbled through his seatbelt looking for his trapper keeper when it occurred to him "I'm in park. It isn't necessary to be wearing this seatbelt." He unclicked and retrieved his files with ease. 

Just as he was selecting between the green or the dark blue pen, the cars began to inch forward. Norman put his papers back in the case quickly, resolving to restore them more carefully when he got inside the house. He fastened his seatbelt and proceeded home without further incident. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/55guy7/norman_in_traffic/] createDate=[1475411433] score=[11] numComments=[0]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman follows an argument] author=[x_y_zed] text=[The passenger sat across the aisle from Norman. 

Norman thought the man looked nervous. He had boarded the train a few stops previously, and never quite settled. He had been making a lot of fuss with a blank form. He had no pen that Norman could see. He seemed to be hoping that someone would offer him one. 

The conductor arrived and Norman showed him his ticket. The conductor was broad, and he took his time. He swayed with the motion of the train. It made him seem tired, physically tired. 

"I need to show you this," the passenger said, once Norman had passed the conductor's scrutiny. 

The conductor took the large sheet of paper that the other man held out, and made a low sound. Norman saw that it was handwritten, and had been stamped and dated. Half a minute passed. 

"I don't do this."

"Excuse me?" asked the passenger.

"Your train was cancelled, fine. I put up with you being on this train without a ticket. But here" - he indicated the last line of the note - "whatever office gave you this asked me to *treat you nice*. I don't have to do that. You haven't bought a ticket."

The conductor had moved closer, and Norman couldn't see either of their faces now. A few seconds of silence passed as the man across the aisle seemed to struggle to assess the situation, to find the right response. Norman wanted to see, but he was grateful not to be seen, too.

"Well, I did have a ticket, on the other train. I spoke with the other conductor, right after getting on, I showed him - "

"There are two conductors on this train!" 

Norman was aware that he was no longer the only person in the carriage watching. The outburst had changed things, diverted gazes. 

He himself had never been yelled at on a train, Norman thought. Once, coming in to land in Newark, late back to his seat, the flight attendant had used that firm voice that they seem they keep only for when it's needed: "*Find* your *seat*, sir." He had never thought that voice would be used on him. His new hope was never to be in the same situation as the man across from him now. You're more anonymous on a plane, you can make it so no-one can catch your eye, he thought. 

"Well I didn't know that at the time, did I?" the passenger was saying now. 

"I can't kick you off, but you don't have a ticket and let me tell you: I *don't* have to be nice to you. I don't know why they always write that."

The passenger relaxed. Norman could not. He was imagining being the centre of attention. 

"Sir, I'm supposed to be on the way to Philadelphia. Instead I'm here, because of the cancellation. I've had to change all my plans, and I won't see my girlfriend til Monday. I have a ten page form to fill out to get a refund. I've already had my day ruined once, and you're angry over this note, which I didn't write. The other conductor - "

"I DON'T HAVE TO BE NICE TO YOU!"

The passenger thought of a short remark, but held it back, and instead only smiled, slightly. 

In the silence, there seemed to be more light, like on a stage. The conductor looked around, saw the faces of his audience, lost his momentum, felt the sway again. He was muttering now, moving away. 

The passenger changed seats, to face the other direction. Norman wondered how long it would be until he lifted his head from the form that he wasn't filling in. 

Norman took out his phone. Nothing from Norman Jr. 

He checked his connecting train. On time.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4u5k1a/norman_follows_an_argument/] createDate=[1469257948] score=[12] numComments=[3]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman has a weird day at the office] author=[lepavun1] text=[   Norman went to work like any other day, but was surprised to see no one at the office. Norman became excited, because he thought he was early, and would now be able to be more productive than usual.

   Norman went to his cubicle, but was astonished that the email with his work had not come in yet. Norman decided to wait for the email to come in, because he didn't want to bother his boss. He sat for a minute before he started growing impatient. He started lightly tapping his foot, to give himself the illusion of progress.

   "What is the point of coming to work early, if there is nothing to do?" Norman thought to himself.

   Norman then realized that his tapping foot became too loud, and would disturb his fellow employees. So, he decided to do what he considered the lesser of two evils, and go to his boss's office and ask for work.

   Norman found it quite peculiar that his boss was not there, and for that matter no one else seemed to be in the office. Norman decided to look around to see if he could find anyone who can explain the situation to him.

   After searching through the office, and finding many new wonders that he never saw, he found a custodial manager mopping the floor.

   "Why is no one here?"

   "Norman, don't you know? It's Sunday."

   Norman realized what happened, and felt ridiculous for making such a simple mistake. Norman was now left with a hard choice, go home, without doing anything and come back tomorrow, or stay at the office over night. This was a hard decision for Norman, because he only uses his car to travel to and from work. However, Norman did not do any work today, so he could not justify the harm his car does to the environment. Norman also knew that his house was too far to walk. So, Norman decided to sit at his computer and wait until he was given some work.

   Norman woke up the next morning to the sound of his email's inbox getting a new piece of mail.

   "Time to work." Norman said excitedly as he proceeded to read the email, followed by going about his business.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4t2m38/norman_has_a_weird_day_at_the_office/] createDate=[1468663801] score=[10] numComments=[1]>

If you're new to this series [here's the catch-up list](https://pineapplestation.wordpress.com/the-apotheosis-of-norman-chronology-table-of-contents/):
___

Sunday morning arose as a radiant burst through the slit in Norman's blinds. Norman was the first to notice the light and the most immediately interested in it, plotting his path to the warm light on the sill as his tail flicked slowly. Norman, meanwhile, was tucked into his quilt, chest rising and falling with some truly impressive snores. 

"Ooph!" Norman's flightpath to the windowsill included using Norman to reach the dresser, from there making the last leap. The plan was kiboshed by Norman's exclamation. "Oh, alright Norman. Let's get you some crunchies." Early morning routine kicked in as Norman rose from bed; slippers, glasses, dodging the cat while filling up Norman's food and water bowl, getting coffee ready, and walking to the lobby to grab his newspaper. To that end he made it to the front door, where Norman found a small envelope tucked under his door.

He opened it:

--

Dear Norman,

Thank you ever so much for joining me last night at Wembly Hall. You are a valiant partner. That and I always enjoy introducing people. You never know how valuable a chance encounter may be! Speaking of, I am going out to visit an old friend next Friday and I won't be home in time to join you for Euchre. If you need a hand finding someone to play with for next week just let me know; I've got some pretty exciting people in my phonebook. Sorry about the trouble.

Your Friend,
Gladys

PS: Wiltshire says hello

--

Before Norman could bring himself to question what "exciting people" meant, he felt a tingle of excitement. The morning paper was forgotten as Norman put an album on and settled into his recliner in the library to think. Who could he ask to play with him? In some distant corner of his mind Norman thought of Norman Jr., sitting across from him with a handful of cards as steam rises from a Styrofoam cup. Now that would be exciting.

Back to reality, Norman thought to himself. Maybe the intern would want to come along? The intern, a quiet fellow who had just graduated from a prestigious university in his home country had once mentioned that he felt lonely. Yes, Norman thought to himself. He might appreciate an invitation. But would be know how to play? One way to find out.

It would be another ninteen minutes before the record finished and Norman, now sipping a weak cup of coffee, realized that he was still without his Sunday paper. Norman took the lift to the lobby and walked to the mail table. As he tucked the paper under his arm Gladys came into the building, fingers covered in dirt.

"Good morning, Gladys! I got your note - don't worry about a thing. I'll ask the office intern if he wants to play". Norman hoped he didn't sound too eager that she was leaving. "Have fun with your old friend!"

Gladys smiled. Was that a pang of sadness Norman saw in Gladys' eye?

He had contributed to a conversation in the office that day with some witty puns, which made some of his coworkers chuckle.  He usually kept to himself, so the experience made him feel confident &amp; adventurous, which prompted him to do something he'd never attempted before: eat a pizza from the outside in.  He would start at the crust, and work his way to the tip of the pizza slice.  He was concerned it would make a mess, so he had prepared a few napkins just in case.  Once the pizza was ready, and he had slipped a slice to Norman (because he had forgotten to feed him in all the excitement) he thumped onto the couch and carefully fed the pizza, crust first, into his mouth.  He got some sauce on his fingers from trying to hold the tip up, but that was okay, he had already prepared for that.  He felt a mildly calming sense of satisfaction wash over him as he ate the last bite, which also had a large pepperoni on it.  He ate the rest of the slices normally, because he had already used up the two napkins he brought to the couch.  He saved the leftovers for his lunch the next day, because the people in the office give him odd looks at lunch break sometimes when he eats his oatmeal out of a tupperware container.  He slept peacefully that night, knowing he could sleep in a few more minutes instead of preparing his oatmeal on the stove.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4gg3m7/norman_buys_a_frozen_pizza/] createDate=[1461656133] score=[11] numComments=[8]>

After nearly a full week of cold, wet, and windy weather, the sun had finally come out. Norman had been excited for this pleasant change in weather ever since Tuesday, when he saw a weather forecast on the front page of a newspaper while paying for his groceries. "Friday, Clear skies with a high of 76."

This morning, the weather was pleasant enough for Norman to drive to work with his windows partially rolled down. He enjoyed the fresh air so much that he even considered going for a walk through the park after feeding Norman.

On his drive way home, Norman saw more people walking on the sidewalks than usual. Three blocks away from his house, Norman group of kids playing catch with a frisbee in their front yard. The entire city seemed a bit more lively today. Norman could not help but smile. 

Norman pulled into his driveway an turned off his car. As he was taking off his seat belt, he saw a raindrop splash against the passenger side window. Then three more landed on his windshield. Soon enough the sky was showering the Earth with heavy rain drops. Norman rushed inside to stay as dry a possible and opened a can of food for Norman.

Norman sighed and said, "Well Norman, April showers bring May flowers!" 

"I suppose weathermen can't be correct 100% of the time" Norman thought to himself. Despite the rain, Norman still felt happy that so many people got to enjoy the nice weather today.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4eulp4/norman_gets_spring_fever/] createDate=[1460715008] score=[9] numComments=[1]>

"No." he replied shyly, looking down and rubbing the back of his neck. "Perhaps I will though." 
That night, with Norman curled in Normans lap, Norman sat in his armchair to watch the new show. He then realized he had no idea how to find the show and decided he was better off watching CSI instead. He didn't feel right switching shows anyway.
The next day Lisa asked Norman what he thought of the new show. Norman knew he couldn't tell a lie, but he also didn't want to disappoint Lisa.

Slowing down to investigate, he spotted a few children looking and pointing at a branch of a large tree. He stopped his car and got out. 

As he approached the group of children, he noticed they were in fact focusing their attention on a cat, which seemed to be stuck up the tree. "Hey kids", said Norman, " need help?". "Thanks mister!", said one of the children, as Norman removed the cat from the tree and placed it on the ground. "Meeeooooww", said the cat, and ran off.

</thread><thread title=[Norman checks out] author=[President_Calhoun] text=[As Norman approached the checkout counter, he saw that there was a new cashier.  She was young - barely out of her teens, he reckoned - and very pretty.

"If I was thirty years younger, I'd try to get her number," Norman said to himself, realizing immediately that it was a lie.  

"Hello," he said as he began placing his items onto the counter.

"Hi, hon!" said the girl, smiling brightly.  "Did you find everything okay?"

The *hon* caught Norman a little off guard.  Was she flirting with him?  "I did, thank you," he replied.

She totaled up his groceries and Norman paid.  "Thanks, sweetie," said the girl.  "Come again!"

Norman nodded.  He considered saying either "Sure will!" or "You bet!", but in the end he merely nodded soberly and said, "Yes."

He went to his car and put the groceries in the back seat.  Then he climbed behind the wheel and sat quietly for a moment.

*Hon... sweetie...*

Girls only used terms of endearment like that if they fancied  you, right?  If they'd checked you out and liked what they saw.  Well, they also called you those things if they saw you as the benign, grandfatherly type, and he certainly wasn't...

He paused in his thinking and stared at his reflection in the rearview mirror.  The person looking back had lines in his face, thinning hair, and weary eyes that looked as if they had seen much when in reality they had seen very little.

He sighed and started the car.

It was all right.  It was nice, really.  The girl had been sweet, and there could never be too much kindness in the world.  And although he might look old to her - and to himself, frankly - he was still young at heart, and that's what mattered.

He put the car in gear and backed out of the parking space.  With a twinkle in his eye, he whispered under his breath, "Would a benign grandfather do this?"

He threw the car into drive and stomped on the gas.  He meant to peel out, lay some rubber, but in the end all he managed to do was leave the parking lot very quickly, nearly clipping the rear end of a Ford Fusion on the way out.

</thread><thread title=[Norman Drives to Work] author=[TheyCallMeDrTapeworm] text=[It was a typical Wednesday for Norman. Except that it had snowed the night before. Nothing major. Only an inch or two. Regardlessly, Norman set his alarm 10 minutes earlier than normal. As such, Norman took his shower 10 minutes earlier than normal, he ate his breakfast 10 minutes earlier than normal, and he left for work 10 minutes earlier. Just in case there was enough snow from the night before to slow down his commute by 10 minutes.

On his way to work there was no snow on the roads. The city had done a good job clearing the roads, thought Norman. By the time Norman reached the intersection of Maple Street and Borough, Norman realized he would likely be at work 10 minutes earlier than normal. He was correct. Driving into the parking lot at exactly 8:50, Norman noticed that there was no snow on the asphalt whatsoever. As he drove to his parking space, number 30, he shared a secret smile with himself. He could not remember the last time he came to work this early. But, this smile quickly melted away. Just past space 31 was supposed to be his space, but what Norman saw instead was a monument of white. It looked as if every inch of snow from the night before, from across the entire parking lot, had all been shoved onto Norman’s parking space.

He was shellshocked. He felt betrayed by those that were supposed to help him. Why would those piloting the snow plows do this to him? What had he done? Norman’s car idled, it was now 8:52. He could take someone else’s parking space, but Norman always tried to make friends not enemies. He could go and use one of the multiple handicapped spaces, but that was just immoral. Besides, what would come of Norman if a handicapped client come today and Norman took what was theirs by birthright?

Another car pulled into the lot. Hoping not to create a Jam, Norman moved on. He parked in a public lot six blocks down. This parking lot hadn’t been cleared nearly as well. Norman was afraid to get out of his car, when he saw a sleeping homeless man on the edge of the lot, but he carried on. By the time he got to work it was 9:17. He was late. Norman feared the loss of his job, but no one seemed to notice. Norman would keep this little secret to himself.

</thread><thread title=[Norman Plans for Tomorrow] author=[MattressCrane] text=[As Norman laid in his bed, he began to rue the day he had just had. *I did nothing,* Norman grumbled to himself, *I didn't leave my apartment once!* Norman pondered whether eight hours of watching CSI: MN was worth doing again on Sunday. Norman leaned up and turned on his bedside lamp, then grabbed a notebook and a pen and started a list:

- Wake up at 9:30
- Exercise
- Dishes
- Feed Norman
- Renew drivers license
- Fix bedroom lightbulb

Norman figured that it might be a bit too much to chew. *Better to overshoot than to un-overshoot,* he thought to himself. He went to sleep confidently, trying his best to make his eyes close without feeling dried after the ten hours of television he had just experienced. 

Norman had a wonderful dream, one that made sure to leave on a cliffhanger each time Norman's alarm went off, so Norman was in too deep with this dream-woman to have it end because of a goal to wake up at 9:30, or 10:30, or 11:30. By noon, Norman climbed out of bed, brushed his teeth, and turned on the television to see what the weather would be like for the day.

It was raining. 

*That doesn't do me any favors at all,* Norman pleaded to himself. The next channel was an episode of CSI mid-way through, so he finished it off before doing anything else, but it was also a two parter, so Norman made sure to watch the next hour as well.

Norman turned his head towards the pile of dishes. Norman mercilessly turned his head back towards the television.

By the end of the day, Norman looked at the note on his night stand. He realized he accomplished none of the goals he had set for himself the night before. In embarrassment, Norman decided not to throw out the note, but to burn it. That way, no one would ever know that he set goals for himself that day.

</thread><thread title=[Norman tries Almond Milk] author=[ByzantiumBall] text=[Norman sat at his desk at work, eating a breakfast bar. 

As he munched away, Lisa happened to walk over. 

"Good morning, Norman!"

"Morning Lisa".

"How's the breakfast bar?"

"OK. I used to have cereal every morning, but I can't process milk as well anymore. Gettin' old".

"Why did I say that?! Far too much information, no one wants to hear that!" Norman thought to himself.

Lisa's mood seemed unchanged, though, and she said "You know what you should try? Almond milk! It's just as good, and it should be OK for you".

"Alright, I'll try it. Thanks" said Norman fairly sheepishly. Mercifully, Lisa excused herself and walked away, leaving Norman to his work.

Work was much the same as usual, and Norman stopped by the grocery store afterwards, as he did every Monday. He remembered Lisa's suggestion earlier and grabbed a small jug of almond milk and put it in his cart. It was rather more expensive than regular milk, and he almost didn't grab any at all. 

Later, at home, he grabbed some Cheerios and the almond milk, poured himself a bowl, and sat down to eat.

He tried a bite.

It didn't taste *bad*, exactly.

He tried another bite.

He decided it was alright. It wasn't the same as regular milk, but it was rather good, if you took it as its own thing. He finished the bowl and put it in the dishwasher. One problem: the small jug would never last the week.

The crashing of Hawaiian waves played in the back of Norman’s mind as he busily scraped the frost off of his windshield Monday morning. Earlier that morning, Norman turned on his phone for the first time in a week, to no surprise that no notifications were left behind. *As if nothing ever happened,* Norman thought. 


Norman ordered a maple flavored iced cappuccino and a sausage-and-egg muffin from a drive thru, and came to his office early, per usual. 


A stack of papers from the half week of work he missed waited on his desk, and Norman got to work.

Norman thought about the haggard Hawaiian restaurant where Claire played footsie’s with him. It led to thinking about the hotel, and their night together. Norman squeezed his eyes shut, until the stars appeared. He forced himself to think about what he would be having for dinner. It didn’t matter what it was, so long as it overcame his thoughts. *I’ll be having chicken for dinner,* Norman stated, *with Sprite.* 


He loved his wife dearly. Her affair took Norman by surprise, and after all was said and done, he couldn’t help but…

*Stop,* Norman thought. He tried to remember which episodes of CSI were recorded over the week. He focused on his pencil, thinking about why HB2 could be so successful, to the point of pushing HB1 to extinction. One of the scavenger hunt items was a pencil, delivered to a historical-

Norman snapped his pencil. Norman thought about if he were a different sort of man, that perhaps it would have been okay to stay with Claire. The husband would never find out, and perhaps she already had a plan to sleep with a stranger on the vacation, and if Norman didn’t do it, someone else would have. He didn’t want to think of Claire to be that sort of person. Norman could never be that man, not after spending so many years of being the man on the opposite side. He couldn’t wish this life on anyone, even if they would never affect his own life.


Norman counted the tabs he had open on his computer, counting down until none were left, and then counting back up, until he surpassed the original number. He counted the change in his pocket, deciding if it was enough for both the parking fare and a bag of chips later tonight. He felt a sharper object in his pocket.


Norman pulled a small turtle figurine out of his pocket, with the word *Waikiki* engraved on its belly. *I must have forgotten it from the scavenger hunt,* Norman thought.


 Back in his apartment is a shoe-box, filled with trinkets and memories, stretching all the way back to when he was a small boy. Good memories, some sad, but all things he’s cherished, and never wanted to forget. A baseball card. A hair-clip, a comb, a rusted coin. A wedding ring, some flattened flowers; drawings from his son.


The turtle would wait on the edge of his desk, near enough so that it would only take a flick or a misplaced glass of water to cause it to fall down into the wastebasket. It was a decision he would have to make someday. 

*Someday,* Norman thought. 


Norman went back to work.

Only took me a bloody year to finish writing this story. Sorry for taking so long, but I figured most people, if interested, would binge it. Also, I had a hard time convincing myself to reach this ending. But finally, this far too long series is finished. That song I posted here is what started it all to begin with, and sat as the theme for myself as I wrote this.

</thread><thread title=[Norman Reads Before Bed Whilst Norman Watches] author=[ligamentary] text=[Norman snuggled down under his swanky department store sheets just washed the day before yesterday. He checked the clock and saw he still had thirty minutes to spare, and with a fresh shave and the tinge of his periodontal rinse still on his tongue, he decided it best to read to sleep. 

He turned to his night table and beneath his nose plugs and water glass was that lovely old book he just got new with a red cover and an introduction by an author just as good as the one who wrote the book. 

He skipped the foreword, tonight he wanted a story. He began reading, the first chapter a mundane recount of the past events in the character's life. By the second chapter things began to pick up. The main character, a retired astronaut, was being pressured to come back into work to guide some hotshot new astronaut who'd taken his place. 

Norman decided to press on through chapter three before setting it down. The junior astronaut meets his predecessor and they get into a ridiculous pissing match over microphysics and lunar modules. The head of the whole operation is trying to force them together to work for the good of the planet. One is ultimately useless without the other. 

Chapter three ends on a cliffhanger. Norman can't sleep on it, he must read the fourth chapter. As one could probably guess by this point, Norman fell into the spell of a good book. Norman sat at the foot of the bed, waffling his tail and trying to stay awake as long as Norman was, but giving up when his eyes became heavier than thoughts. 

With a warm cat to curl up with Norman was led on a journey through space and time. The federal government was the main antagonist, or really, the Secretary of Defense was. The astronauts band together and go to fight human-alien hybrids on a distant planet just now discovered. But to beat their common enemy, the defense secretary, the aliens must team up with the very astronauts they had previously despised. With a climactic scene taking place on the bridge of a nose protruding from an intergalactic Mount Rushmore, Norman flipped the last page and closed the book with finality. It was now 3:00am and he put a saucer of milk out should Norman wake ahead of him. 

As Norman repositioned himself in bed, he appreciated the fact that as an adult he could choose to stay up all night should he find himself in an engaging book, and there was nobody to stop him. It was one of the first times Norman, already halfway through his life, grasped the meaning of the true autonomy of adulthood. "And they say never buy books at the airport!" Norman said, switching his light off and digging in his heels, anticipating another good book and another good day, several dreams from now. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/55hd1g/norman_reads_before_bed_whilst_norman_watches/] createDate=[1475423048] score=[9] numComments=[0]>

Then he realized that that would mean the milk and eggs he needed would have to sit in his car while he got a haircut and they might get kind of warm and gross.

</thread><thread title=[Norman almost takes a risk.] author=[Startupstevo] text=[Norman was having a usual day at work but had a bit of a tummy ache after his brown bagged lunch of PB&amp;J. "Guess I shouldn't have eaten it so fast." he thought to himself quietly pondering what to do. He decided to head to the restroom. 

He felt embarrassed as his co-workers watched him head to the bathroom AGAIN after his routine usage everyday, 5 minutes before lunch. "I better make this quick or they'll think I'm taking it easy at work" he told himself as he turned slightly red. When he got to the bathroom he checked his pockets for his TUMS, which helps his stomach aches. He searched and searched but to no avail he'd forgotten them at home!

He was very uncomfortable but didn't want to have to inconvenience anyone. All of the sudden his co-worker Patrick entered the bathroom. He nervously said "Good afternoon Patrick". Patrick gave a side eyed smile and nod and said, "hey Norman". Norman felt gasses bloating in his stomach and was getting very uncomfortable. He knew the person next to Patrick had Pepto Bismol, which he's never tried but in times of danger he knew he had to be adventurous. Norman was sweating thinking of how to nicely ask Patrick for his co-worker's Pepto Bismol. Before he could finally open his mouth, Patrick's Co-worker burst into the bathroom with a massive stomach ache and Pepto Bismol in hand. "OH boy this ones not gunna be good!!" The co-worker said as he ran to the first stall in sight. 

Gastric sounds that sounded similar to Norman's favorite sci-fi show "robot alien" started to come from the stall. Norman giggled to himself but tried not to be audible. Patrick who was obviously concerned tried to talk to his co-worker through the stall. "You alright in there Derrick?" Patrick asked. Norman used this opportunity to sit in the empty stall next to Derrick. 

Norman could partially see under his stall. Derrick's feet were pointing outward with pain and strain. But there it was on the floor, Pepto Bismol the solution to his problem. How would he reach it? If he grabbed it Derrick would see and likely be upset.

Norman decided it was time to stop playing around and get serious...but he couldn't grab it. He walked out of the bathroom and headed towards Derrick's  desk with intentions of taking a small sip of his Pepto Bismol. As he got closer he looked over to
his desk and noticed his files were untidy. "Let me fix this before I go over there." He felt somewhat confident but needed to prioritize work. But as he got to his desk he noticed that his TUMS were hidden under the clutter. He'd forgotten it on his desk.

He felt relieved and his stomach actually didn't hurt anymore. As he drove home from work that night he wondered if he should get Derrick a get well card. He wondered about it the whole car ride but realized his show was starting at 9pm and he had to feed his cats. "Maybe next time" he said happily to himself as he pulled into his driveway.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4wbgfq/norman_almost_takes_a_risk/] createDate=[1470445862] score=[9] numComments=[0]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman does without] author=[[deleted]] text=[It was Tuesday. Norman sat down to his dinner, poking a chunk of sesame chicken with his fork in desultory fashion. He let out a sigh.

*Why, oh why? That was my favorite hat. It fit me perfectly. I loved the color; faded navy blue. And that button attached to the back. The one Lisa gave me. How could I have left it on the bus? How could I have been so absent-minded?*

Norman had already called the bus service. Apparently the hat had not been found.

*It just had to happen today, too. The day I'm meeting Arthur for drinks. I'd counted on that hat. It really suited me. In an effortless, casual sort of way.*

Norman continued to reflect. An acquaintance from the office, Arthur, had asked him to watch the U.S. Open with him that evening. Norman didn't know much about tennis, but always looked forward to these kinds of social outings as opportunities to learn more about himself. He didn't get out much, but when he did, he liked to look his best. 

*I suppose I'll just have to do without,* thought Norman. *But I can't imagine this week could possibly get any worse.*

</thread><thread title=[Norman gets a voicemail] author=[discthief] text=[We find Norman watching tv with Norman on a Wednesday evening. Norman's ears perk up, as his usually quiet cell phone has caused quite the clamor. Norman looks down at the vibrating and illuminated screen to see one of his worst nightmares. No contact name. Just a phone number. The area code is local, so Norman knows there's a good chance he has met this person before. 

Looking down at the phone, back at the tv, back to the phone. Norman thinks of every person he has ever met in his entire life in the hopes of someone coming to mind who might be calling him right now. By the time Norman decides not to answer, the phone has already stopped buzzing. 

A cool sigh of relief escapes his lips, as a secondary tone grabs his attention again. A voicemail. Thank goodness, Norman will be able to figure out who called, relieving him of this horrible anxiety. 

He dials up the voicemail box and hits 1 to play the new message. It is an automated voice, reminding Norman of his car appointment on Thursday morning at 9:30am.

Norman had already remembered the meeting, but was content knowing if he had forgotten, the voicemail would have saved him the embarrassment of missing an appointment. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4q1kaj/norman_gets_a_voicemail/] createDate=[1467030622] score=[9] numComments=[1]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman's Dress Down Day] author=[Chrdav65] text=[“$29.99 is your total.”

Norman reached into his pocket and pulled out three crisp 10 dollars bills and handed them to the cashier. It was Thursday at 3pm and Norman found himself at Wal-Mart buying his first pair of jeans in over 10 years. Norman had left work before lunch that day to take his cat, Norman, to his yearly vet check-up.

Norman got home from the store and laid the new jeans out on his bed. Norman stepped back for a moment to admire them. Tomorrow would be dress down day and for the first time since he started with the company Norman decided he would wear jeans as permitted.

That night Norman had trouble sleeping due to the excitement.

The next morning at work Norman arrived promptly at 8:45am and got out of his car. He noticed several of his co-workers walking into the building wearing dress pants and khakis. Norman’s heart sank as Lisa walked by.

“I..I.. thought today was dress down day?” Norman said to Lisa.

“Oh my, you left early yesterday and didn’t get the e-mail they sent out. The CEO is coming today so they wanted everyone to dress professionally.”

Norman embarrassingly went through his entire day wearing his jeans. He didn’t get up from his desk a single time, eating his lunch at his desk and limiting his water consumption to avoid a bathroom break.

By 5:20pm everyone had cleared out of the office for the weekend and Norman was able to safely exit without anyone else seeing him. 

Norman thought about returning his jeans that caused him so much trouble that day but knew the store policy was that you could not return a clothing item after you have already worn them.

“Maybe I could just say I didn’t wear them yet.” Norman said aloud to his cat, Norman, while filling his food dish that night. Norman’s cat looked up at him and let out a soft meow.

“You’re right, that wouldn’t be very honest.”

</thread><thread title=[Norman catches some foreign disease] author=[[deleted]] text=[In the interval of the last thirty minutes, Norman had sneezed no less than five times. That last one made his eyes tear up and he had to protract his handkerchief from his pocket to wipe them dry again. Doing so rewarded him with a concerned look from Lisa, his co-worker who was just sitting across him at the office.

"Are you doing fine, Norman?", she asked nonchalantly.

"I'm not so sure. I heard there's this Asian flu going around, and I ate Sushi yesterday. But maybe it's just my normal allergies acting up again, ... it's birch season, after all!", he added, trying to sound reassuring and confident in his own claim. But a nagging doubt harassed Norman's mind for a while: "What if it's not your normal allergic reaction but something more unpredictable, more unknown than your everyman's cold? Who's going to take care of Norman, when you're all sick and lying down in bed?'

Fortunately, that wasn't the case however. After lunch, he had returned from the canteen to his office space, chatting with Monica from Accounting until their ways parted at the stairway.

</thread><thread title=[Norman receives an urgent communication] author=[sadoldgradstudent] text=[Norman parked his car in the driveway and let the engine run for a minute while he listened to the end of an interview on NPR with the young CEO of a highly profitable tech startup. "Maybe" he thought "I should build an app, it's not too late. Who knows, I might get a lucky break!" He turned off the idling sedan and got out of the car, heading to the mailbox. 

As he went through the day's mail he found something unusual: a letter marked "Open Immediately: Time-Sensitive Materials Inside." Norman hurried inside his house, closing the door and tossing his keys on the sofa. He was concerned that perhaps he missed a bill "or maybe there is some unclaimed funds somewhere in my name" he thought. Norman emerged from the litter box, leaving a wake of litter crystals behind him, and looked at Norman curiously.

Norman opened the letter, and inside was a promotional flyer for a car dealership the next town over. 

YOU MIGHT BE THE WINNER OF A NEW CAR. COME TO SCHWEIBACH NISSAN ON FRIDAY MAY 26. IF YOUR KEY STARTS THE CAR - YOU DRIVE IT HOME.

Norman peeled the key off of the flyer and turned it around around in his sweaty hand. He could feel the sticky, gummy, residue of the glue on his fingers. 

"I probably won't win. Even if I do I'll have to pay the taxes on it, which there's no way I can afford that."

Norman recycled the flyer and pre-heated the oven for dinner. Schweibach Nissan had a very successful weekend. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4l8r73/norman_receives_an_urgent_communication/] createDate=[1464344055] score=[8] numComments=[0]>

It was a Saturday morning and he felt that he would have scrambled eggs today. As he opened the door, Norman rubbed against his legs, causing him to accidentally swing the door a little farther out than intended. A magnet clattered to the floor, taking an old take out menu with it.

"Beautiful Atlantic City!" He turned it over a few times in his hands, feeling the soft rubber grooves against his fingers, and tried to remember when he had last traveled to his northerly neighbor state, New Jersey. 

His wife's cousin! That was it! Her wedding had been held in Atlantic City and Norman and his wife had spent the week at one of the resorts. He had quite liked the boardwalk- there was a place there that had the most delicious pretzels. He remembered they had ordered two pretzels for an after dinner treat, but received three in their bag instead. They tore up the third and fed it to the seagulls as they talked together on a salt stained bench.

</thread><thread title=[Norman Receives Yet A Third Nighttime Message] author=[Castriff] text=[The first thing Norman did when he returned to his house was retrieve his phone from the kitchen counter. A few hours after his conversation with Leslie, another coworker (who also had a Windows phone) had come to his cubicle to notify Norman about a function on his phone called "Quiet Hours." Norman had heard about this function when he had bought the phone, but it had never seemed prudent that he set it up.

"Yeah, it's great," Larry had said, holding his phone out for Norman to view its screen. "It automatically turns itself on at night, and I have it set up so that the only people that can call are from work." Norman had nodded and graciously thanked Larry for this information. Larry then offered to set up Norman's phone, but because it had been at home, Norman had been forced to decline.

It took Norman about ten minutes to rediscover the correct settings page and turn on the options he wanted. He added everyone in his work contacts to his "Inner Circle," as well as his son Norman. Then he ate dinner, fed Norman (the cat), and watched CSI until bedtime.

At exactly 2:34 AM, Norman awoke to the sound of his phone buzzing on his bedside table. He sat up and picked up his phone.

&gt;marcie your a jerkface and i hppe you nvr find lov

Tired as he was, it took Norman some time to realize that the text was not meant for him. Presumably, Robert had gotten drunk and sent the same message to everyone in his address book. More texts streamed in, both from Robert and from irate coworkers who didn't know how to send texts to him individually.

Somewhat frustrated, Norman powered down his phone entirely, then rolled over and tried to return to sleep.

</thread><thread title=[A Norman Short Film: Here's the deal, people.] author=[MattressCrane] text=[So, less than a week ago I said that I might be making a Norman short film for the Rode Reel competition. I said that I would gage the interest of my fellow filmmakers here where I live, to see if they would be want to work together on a project like this. I don't think they know Norman like I do, but the whole established audience thing, the 57,000 of you, makes it an easy sell to outsiders.

I wrote out a few scripts and sent it around, and they all like it- but it's too short. I'll post it here, and you guys can give me some feedback as well on the stories chosen for the script. 

Anyways, the too short thing- the Rode Reel contest requires it to be between 1-3 minutes. I wrote a script that fits there, but at the same time, it's wasted potential to make it that short. The other problem comes from the fact that screenwriting is a terribly different monster than just prose. If you write something in, you *have* to figure out how it can be filmed, and filmed for the cheap.

So here's my proposal so far: I'm going to write a 5-10 minute short, and after the script is locked, I'll do the storyboarding and budget planning. Once I've figured out the bare minimum for the project, I'll start a kickstarter, and if we can hit the goal, we'll make the short. 

That's a stretch, I know, who knows how many people will actually care to donate. I'm guessing now, with a project of this size, the minimum would be around 4,000 dollars. I've thought about stretch goals, and I've started to make moves towards some of them, and all I can say now is that if they work out, it'll be super, super cool. 

Here's the first draft of the script. I think it's impossible to capture every aspect of Norman, so I just focused on a few.

https://www.dropbox.com/s/12o1w378hvzvyxm/Norman%20Short%20Film.pdf?dl=0



That's my pitch for now. And as for an update to the book, since I'm the same person working on that as well, I'm currently not touching it until the 15th- my last day of college. After that, there's not a whole lot left to do, and I can see me getting the final draft done in May. Then after that, I'll just be waiting for a review copy for myself.

He didn't actually need a new chair. He already had one chair in front of the television but sometimes Norman would be using it. So, he was really buying a chair for Norman, or himself, depending on Norman's mood.

He had asked for Norman's views but he wasn't feeling very cooperative as he lolled on the armchair, and besides, it was clear which chair Norman wanted.

So Norman looked for a chair similar to the chair he already owned. There were lots of chairs that looked like his chair but each of them were slightly too different. 

Norman leaped off the armchair and trotted up to see what Norman was doing on the computer. "Mewl," said Norman.

Norman saw his opportunity and ran back to his armchair, pursued by Norman who jumped onto his lap.

***
Norman fiddled with the fortune cookie in his pocket, taken from the Chinese Restaurant he had just the pleasure of having his dinner at this evening. He crumbled the cookie down to a powder, making sure to fight the urges as he stayed true to a diet he started the week before. As he walked through his apartment hallway, just about to peel open the wrapper and read his fortune, Norman heard shouting. 

It was Frank and Josie. As Norman neared their apartment door, the shouting grew louder, harsher, more explicit, and clear as day.

*“You’re a fucking cunt, Josie! Always were! You gonna try to raise a cunt daughter?! Not on my watch! Don’t you fucking dare!”* 

*“You say this shit in front of her, and she’s going to end up fucking miserable like you! You’re a piece of shit!”*

Norman could hear Amber in the room too, a wailing cry. It shook the walls. Norman choked on saliva as he struggled to swallow, his head throbbed in the burst of anxiety, his knees wobbled, and his fist hovered by the door, desperately hoping to gain the momentum and knock.


*This is that slap in the face*, Norman thought. The fighting was relentless and it wouldn’t stop unless Norman did something. Norman would just have to knock, that’s all, and perhaps it wouldn’t solve anything, but at least it would stop the fighting. A simple knock on the door. He did it all the time. He wasn’t tired, wasn’t lazy, and he had no physical excuse in the world not to just do it. What if the knock wasn’t heard? What if they were so heavily in the throws of their fight that, no matter how hard he knocked, it wouldn’t be noticed? Norman had no excuse, none but the ones he gave himself, the moments of hesitation forming to something tangible. No one would hold Norman accountable if he didn’t say anything. He could still be at the Chinese restaurant, for all anyone cared. If  someone else came through the hallway, perhaps they could knock together. Anyone at all, *somebody else*. It would be safer that way. It would all end up okay.

Norman unlocked the front door to his apartment. It was quiet, calm inside. A leftover pot of tea from the morning sat on the counter, and his cat slept soundly on the recliner, moving to a stretch as it became aware of Norman coming home. Norman changed into his cozies and turned on television, aimlessly flipping through the channels. He muted the television, and listened carefully. He couldn’t hear anything. He didn’t know if it was always this way, or if the fighting had stopped. He could hear stomping on the ceiling sometimes. The streets below often echoed honking horns through the cracked kitchen window. It wasn’t always this quiet. Things could be worse. 

Norman pulled the fortune cookie wrapper from his coat pocket, still filled with the crumbs and fortune inside. Norman pinched open the package and pulled out the paper.

**“Two days from now, tomorrow will be yesterday.”** 

*Two days from now will be Friday*, Norman tried to joke with himself. Norman lifted the package upwards and poured the crumbs into his mouth. He didn’t forget about his diet, but he knew that one cookie wouldn’t have made that much of a difference anyways. A single cookie was the least of his worries.

<comment number=[2]author=[Odrevan]text=[I'm glad we got Frank's perspective on everything in the early parts before we saw how it truly was. I don't get the significance of the fortune cookie here. Is it saying no matter what Norman does, he is powerless? Norman can't stop the tide of time, what ever happens, happens?

	Norman laid his head on the pillow.  It was soft, and Norman curled up beside him.  Norman had gargled with salt water to get rid of a canker sore.  But not too much salt, as Norman disliked any flavor stronger than Rainbow white bread.  Norman shut his eyes and fell asleep at exactly 10pm, as that was his bedtime and needed to get up at exactly 8am.

</thread><thread title=[Norman Goes to the Restroom] author=[IRONxHORSE] text=[Norman had just finished his lunch when he got the sudden urge to go to the restroom. He looked at the time. It was 12:55, just enough time to run to the restroom and make it back to work before his lunch was over. As he entered the restroom, he noticed there was already another person using the urinal. There were other urinals, but Norman was too shy to use them with someone else in the room. He decided to use one of the stalls instead. Suddenly, he was struck with a dilemma. "The other person is going to hear me pee and then they will think I didn't want to stand in an adjoining urinal to pee", he thought. He did the only thing he could think of: he pulled out 2 toilet seat covers, sat down, and pretended to go number 2 instead. He sat there for longer than he would have liked, waiting for the other person to leave the restroom. He was getting filled with anxiety, as his lunch was almost over and he hadn't returned to his cubicle yet. When the other person finally left, he wiped anyways (just in case there was someone else in the room he hadn't noticed) before washing his hands and leaving the restroom. He made it back to his cubicle at 1:05. That day, he stayed until 5:05 to make up for being late back from lunch. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5az6i2/norman_goes_to_the_restroom/] createDate=[1478233553] score=[10] numComments=[0]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman makes a complaint [Long story]] author=[SamwiseIAm] text=[Norman woke up on a Sunday feeling peckish. After his morning routine, he decided, he would head over to Mama’s Cafe. He finished getting ready, grabbed his Kangol, wallet, and keys, and headed out the door. It was a short walk to the cafe and he probably managed it twice a week now for at least a year. Opening the door, he was greeted with a smile by Theresa. “How’s the granddaughter, Theresa?” Norman asked with a friendly smile. A confused look passed over Theresa’s face, but then she responded, “Um, she’s fine, thanks.” Despite being a regular, apparently Theresa didn’t recognize Norman and she certainly didn’t seem to remember telling the table next to him about her granddaughter the last time Norman was in. Theresa asked if anyone was to be joining him today and Norman mumbled that it was just him.


Norman sat at his table patiently, knowing already what he would like to eat- the usual toast and two eggs with a side of sausage. A few minute passed and Norman smiled amiably about, noting that the restaurant was a little slow, and wondering when a server would be by to take his order. It must have been about 15 minutes before his server, Angela, showed up to ask what he’d like to drink. Norman was a upset by Angela’s tardiness, but Norman always assumed the best of people so he didn’t remark on how long it had taken her to get to him and simply asked for a glass of orange juice and a glass of water. He was about to say that he was ready to order food, as well, but Angela had zipped off to grab his drinks before he could get a word out about it.


Many more minutes passed with Norman’s mouth feeling dryer and dryer when Angela finally showed back up with his drinks and asked if was ready to order. Norman mumbled angrily under his breath “I’ve been ready for quite some time” but Angela didn’t seem to catch it. “I’m sorry?” She responded with a half smile, half look of confusion. Norman took a breath to steel himself and asked for his usual. “Oh, right, The Usual. Which is…?” Angela replied. Norman was certain that Angela was the same server that had helped him at least 3-4 times a month for the past several months, but again he let is pass and Norman gave his order while trying not to sound as annoyed as he was. Norman hoped Angela hadn’t noticed his tone of voice. He was constantly concerned that some spit would wind up in his food if he was anything but nice to servers. Angela just jotted down his order and was off again in a heartbeat.


Norman sat there, contemplating everything that is wrong with the world. Today’s youth, Norman thought, have no manners. Can’t remember faces because their heads are always down looking at a screen. No one has basic manners anymore. Common courtesy was less and less common with every new generation, etc. etc. Norman was lost in thought about the woes of the world today when his food arrived. He hadn’t noticed a lot of time passing, but his food was luke warm by the time Angela set it on the table, topped off his water, and asked if he needed anything else. Norman just mumbled that he was fine and picked up his knife to spread butter and jam on his toast. Norman thought that the food would have been wonderful if it had arrived on time and hadn’t gotten cold by the time he was just half way through it. That was the last straw. Norman made his mind up to complain to the manager on the way out. Regulars weren’t supposed to have such bad experiences! They should be respected, remembered, and valued!


When Norman was done with his meal and received his check, he marched toward the cashier at the front, mentally reviewing everything that had upset him. He paid his bill then asked to see a manager. A tired, grumpy looking gentleman came up front. “Yes?” asked the man, with a bit of a bark to his voice.  Norman thought the man was pretty rude for not introducing himself or shaking his hand. “Um, about the food…” Norman began. “Yeah, what about it?” The man barked again, cutting Norman off. Norman took note of the man’s hard stare and after a few moments Norman lost his nerve. “Uh, the food was great.” Norman finally spit out, “And so was the service.” Norman added hastily. He turned and walked quickly away before the man could yell at him. His heart was racing and he was sure he heard the man mumble something about wasting his time right before the door closed. Norman headed back home, breathing hard and realized when he got to his door that he left his keys on the table at the cafe. He decided to go to the park, and maybe check back at the restaurant for his keys after shift change.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5a2v7n/norman_makes_a_complaint_long_story/] createDate=[1477807066] score=[10] numComments=[2]>

His arms felt snug and he stretched them all the way back with a heave of his ribcage.

Then he brushed his teeth, swished his periodontal rinse, slipped into some cornflower blue pajamas, and snuggled into bed. 

"Whoops." Thought Norman, "Forgot to turn the hall light out."

</thread><thread title=[Norman Sees An Acquaintance On The Street] author=[ligamentary] text=[Norman was walking to the mailbox when he noticed an acquaintance coming out of the corner store. 

Norman froze. 

He was really in a hurry, he had to leave for a dentist appointment straight away after mailing the letter. Furthermore, he knew he'd met this man twice before, but he wasn't 100% sure of his name. He didn't want to be rude and avoid the person, but he wondered if it would be worse to cut their conversation short and rush away. 

He decided to cross the street. 

His eyes downcast, he made a bee-line for the crosswalk, when he heard the acquaintance call out, "Norman! Hello? Norman!" Cringing, Norman turned on his heel and summoned a smile. "Hey... Buddy" Norman said, resisting the urge to jerk back as the man pulled him into a hug. 

"How are ya? How's the neighborhood's favorite kitty?" Norman began to answer when he was cut off--"You know my daughter wants to get a cat but it seems like too much work. I mean--" 

Norman inconspicuously checked his watch and realized he didn't even have time to mail his letter anymore. He didn't want to be rude to this guy, but he knew it would be worse to be tardy to a longstanding appointment. "So listen, it's great to see you, but I'm sorry I was just on my way to an appointment." "Oh." An awkward silence followed. Norman tried to smooth it out "But let's get together some other time." The acquaintance nodded. "Sure thing, we'd love that. You have my number. See ya Norman!" 

Norman walked away, relieved to be free. Until he realized, he couldn't call this person, he still doesn't remember his name. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/56pub5/norman_sees_an_acquaintance_on_the_street/] createDate=[1476096553] score=[9] numComments=[0]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman At the Vending Machine] author=[ligamentary] text=[Norman felt parched in the midday. 

He would have patronized the public water fountain, but Norman feared his lips grazing the nozzle of the fountain as intensely as he feared death. 

He ventured down the hall to the Pepsee brand vending machine by the elevator. 

He was frustrated to realize it did not accept credit cards. He held his breathe as he searched for acceptable bills in his wallet. He only had a $100, a $5 and a crumpled $1. 

The machine didn't accept hundreds, and if he used the five, he'd get coin change. Norman had enough problems without coin change. 

He tried to insert the dollar bill, but it was rejected. He flipped it upside down, but it was rejected again. He pulled it taut and used his thumbs to smooth any wrinkles. But it was rejected. 

He saw the condensation on the soda in the machine. He stood on top of the dollar bill to flatten it once more. 

"Egads!" Norman exclaimed. It had accepted the bill. He entered the number for his drink of choice. He watched it gracefully fall and clank into the delivery receptacle. 

He a boost of both confidence and hydration, he returned to his desk. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/56fwgc/norman_at_the_vending_machine/] createDate=[1475938300] score=[6] numComments=[0]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman's New Neighbors] author=[ligamentary] text=[Norman had been passively avoiding the new neighbors for several weeks now. 

He didn't have a particular problem with the neighbors, but he wasn't home often and didn't need any new friends. 

Norman was going to stop by as the new neighbors were moving in, to shake their hands and get it over with, but he didn't want to impose at a stressful time. Thus he continued putting it off, finding excuses, and avoiding eye contact. It wasn't until Norman found himself peeking through the blinds to check if they'd left yet so he could go to his car, that he realized he had a problem. 

While Norman wanted to be on good terms with the neighbors, he did not want them to start asking for things. The old neighbors were always out of this and borrowing that. The neighbors before them were always having little get togethers and theme parties, and Norman always felt so awkward and unsociable when he declined to go every time. When they left, he was almost hoping the house would be condemned or rezoned as a gas station. 

He finally went over one day and tried to force small talk. "Hiya, I'm Norman, I live just across the way." They didn't appear to have heard him. Norman cleared his throat to repeat himself, but folded at the last minute, covering his face and hurrying away. 

"Eventually they'll have to move out and I'll get a do over." Norman reconciled. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/569ck5/normans_new_neighbors/] createDate=[1475838294] score=[8] numComments=[1]>

Norman entered the store and went down the soda aisle, surprised and disheartened to find the "Mr. Pibb" root beer display to be stark empty. 

He went to the register and summoned a clerk to inquire as to the whereabouts of his carbonated beverage of choice. "We appear to be all out mate, I do apologize. We have some Dr. Pepper? They taste the same" The clerk said with a gruff but empathetic accent. "Sorry but I prefer the bubble proportions in Mr. Pibb." Norman replied. He felt a bit silly, but wasn't going to waste his hard earned money on a product he knew he didn't want. Not again. 

"We aren't due for another shipment until the first of the month but we can order some extra if you'd like. It should take about four days." 

Norman thought it over for a minute. "Alright, that'll be fine. Thank you for your help." They coordinated the order and Norman purchased his oyster crackers and went on his way.

Norman picked it from his pocket and saw there was a text from Steve, his coworker- the guys from the office were doing beers and he was invited.

Because he hated standing out, Norman left home twenty minutes earlier than necessary, so that he would shake the hands of each people as they arrived, in stead of having to do everyone at once. Upon arriving, Norman peeked at the tables from outside and saw none of the guys;. there wasn't much movement yet, just few tables occupied by groups of four and five, maybe six people.

He considered getting a table, but then Norman pictured a middle aged man sitting alone at the bar, drinking by himself for twenty minutes. Even worse would be a creepy middle aged man sitting sitting still for twenty whole minutes.

Norman went to the bus stop around the corner until one of the guys texted their group chat that they had arrived. He stood there with the crowd waiting for their rides, where he could do nothing and still look normal.

</thread><thread title=[Norman visits HR] author=[zathalen100] text=[Norman's palms were clammy. He hadn't seen Judy from HR since he had accidentally turned the wrong way going to the snack machine for a cookie and ended up walking past Judy's office.

Judy was not like normal co-workers *she had an office with a door* something Norman could only dream of. 

If Norman had an office with a door, he might close it one day and play music while he *worked!* Or *maybe* he would put a second picture on his wall! 

He usually only had one as he assumed that if he had too many he might be in trouble. He sat uncomfortably in Judy's second chair and waited for her to speak. 

Judy handed Norman a piece of paper, it was warm, a comforting feeling if it wasn't given to him by Judy. 

"We need you to work tomorrow, here is your schedule."  

Norman didn't want to work tomorrow, he usually went shopping for cat food and watched CSI, he had just ordered the box set for the first season and he looked forward to waiting in case the delivery came 3 days early. He already had the box set, but he was afraid that if he ordered something different, it wouldn't get there on time.

"Ok" Norman replied. Norman left the office, warm paper in hand. Norman found the snack machine, it was out of cookies.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4wjnkm/norman_visits_hr/] createDate=[1470577330] score=[8] numComments=[1]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Now Resides on Ragged Ass Road] author=[MattressCrane] text=[Norman had just came home from a knick knack store with a smile on his face and a sign in his hand. *I bet my neighbors will get a kick out of this,* Norman thought to himself.

The sign was a small green street marker with the words "Ragged Ass Rd" written on it. Norman found it humorous- humorous enough to spend thirty dollars for it. He planned on hanging the sign in his apartments hallway.

The morning after Norman hung up the sign, Norman was wrought with guilt.

Gary, Norman's landlord, was a nice guy. He meant well- sure, he charged Norman extra for having a cat, but it was a reasonable surcharge. Norman was feeling guilty- this apartment building was Gary's pride and joy. This funny little sign was a little slap to Gary's face. 

Norman took down the sign, and put a note that read "sorry" in its place for the next three days.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4jxsqq/norman_now_resides_on_ragged_ass_road/] createDate=[1463620953] score=[7] numComments=[2]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Drops Acid] author=[VivianCadence] text=[It was a rather quiet Monday, and having the day off of work Norman decided he should use his day wisely and do something he wouldn't have time for otherwise. One thing he'd always noticed was how time-consuming giving his kitchen floor a proper mopping was; being a safe and practical shopper, he always used the very strong solution that requires lots of dilution and a rather large bucket. It was a fairly messy process and quite the ordeal, but he always felt very proud of himself after getting it all cleaned up.

On this particular day, though, when Norman picked up the large gallon-sized bottle of the cleaning solution, he did so by the lid, which hadn't been properly secured after the last time he mopped. Very pungent, acidic, undiluted solution spilled everywhere as the jug toppled over. Instead of getting his floor mopped the way he had fancied, Norman spent the afternoon cleaning the acid up from the spill, taking care to use neutralizing solvents so as to minimize the damage to the plain laminate flooring. "Oh well," he thought to himself as he finished up. "At least some of the floor got clean-- even if it was by accident!" He chuckled to himself and decided the afternoon hadn't been wasted after all.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4ggp2y/norman_drops_acid/] createDate=[1461664972] score=[8] numComments=[4]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman goes to the mall] author=[JaromStrong] text=[Norman hated the mall; everything about it made him uncomfortable. The hundreds of people rushing in every direction, the loud chatter of conversation fogging up the air, the ungenuine friendly looks that every worker gave him as he browsed. Everything was dreadful.

But today Norman was at the mall. He needed to buy a gift for his son's birthday, and he wasn't sure what to get him. Norman had looked all day for something that felt right, but nothing seamed to fit. He'd exhausted every option he had, trying very hard to avoid the mall, but he was desperate.

Norman wandered the mass shopping center, keeping care to avoid eye contact with any store clerc or passerby. Eventually Norman stopped at a toy store. He looked at it from a distance, and for a moment fond memories of past birthdays flowed into his head. He remembered his son's first few birthdays where presents were easy. His son had always loved toy cars. Spending the day worrying about an appropriate present was unnessesary then.

Then Norman came back to reality and frowned. His son wouldn't want a silly toy he thought; he was a man now afterall.

Norman searched for a while after that. Finally he decided on a simple white shirt he found in a fashionable clothing store (or what he deemed fashionable). It was plain, but comfortable. Just what a man of his own making needs. The shirt was thirty-nine dollars even. Norman thought this was exceptionally expensive for a simple shirt, but since it was for his son, it was worth it.

Later that day Norman went to wrap his present, but decided agaisnt it as that seemed childish, and he didn't want to embarrass his son. Instead, he put it in a simple cardboard box and prepared it for mailing. He would mail it tomorrow and it should arrive early if nothing went wrong with the post service.

Norman felt good about his gift, then he thought back to the toy store. *No. What a silly thought. This shirt was the right decision.*

</thread><thread title=[Norman Writes His Dream Down] author=[geckointhetrash] text=[Norman dreamt Wednesday night.  The dream was especially vivid, and Norman remembered reading somewhere that such especially vivid dreams were worth writing down.  He decided to dedicate the following Saturday to the endeavor.
                          
Unfortunately, by the time Saturday had rolled around, Norman had forgotten many of the distinct details that made his dream so vivid.  It was all swathes of color, vague notions of scenes in which the characters had forgotten their lines.
  
But he couldn’t just give up.  Norman had dedicated this time to writing his dream down!  Come on, man, *think*!

The dream… yes, the dream was split into two halves.  The first half was orange, green, blue… a log across a stream, acting as a bridge.  Bright, sunny walls… rock faces, like a canyon.  There was a person there.  No, not a person.  More like, like a thing that *imitated* people.  It took the concept of a person, and mimicked that, but lacked the small details that made people… individuals.  And, and it came in and out of the dream, like a ghost, phasing through dimensions.  When it phased in and out like that, this thing, was it blinking in and out of existence, or going somewhere else in Norman’s mind?

In the second half of his dream, Norman met… his own cat, Norman!  Only Norman: The Cat was Norman: A Person, and running for mayor.  They bumped into each other in the busy hallway of a ski-lodge, which was lined with metal lockers, each about the size of a shoebox and painted grey.  Norman asked Norman For Mayor what he thought about tax-funded public art.  Norman For Mayor didn’t say anything; instead nodding politely as he contorted his body and stuffed himself into one of the lockers, so that all that stuck out was a foot. 
 
It was only while writing it all down that Norman realized that someone running for mayor in a busy ski-lodge hallway would probably be in a hurry, and not have time for questions.  

He left it at that, set the pen down, and sighed.  Why did he do this?  The sound of soft purring crept up from the floor, and Norman looked down to see Norman The Cat rubbing against his leg.  Norman lifted the cat up and, smiling, said, “You’d make a pretty good mayor, if they let you run.”  Norman smiled back.

</thread><thread title=[Norman changes his calendar.] author=[Ctrl_L] text=[It was early on a Friday morning, and Norman found himself feeling a little under the weather. Even though the day wasn't a rainy one, it was just a bit cloudy.  Norman stood in the kitchen and almost sighed.  After triple checking that Norman had ample supply of cat food in his dish, he set off to have his own meal. A few minutes later as Norman was washing the dish in the sink, he suddenly felt a burst of joy as he remembered today was the first day of the month! "I can change my calendar!" Quite obviously, Norman had to finish cleaning before he could rush off, but he couldn't help but dry the dish wearing a smile on his face.

As he cleaned, Norman wondered what next month's picture would be in the calendar. As much as he wanted to, he hadn't peaked ahead before it was time. Norman would surely miss March's tiger striped cat, but April deserved a turn. "Maybe it'll be a fluffy white cat." He mused. "Or a black one" Norman quite enjoyed guessing. He was so distracted by thoughts of the calendar, that his hands fumbled and he almost dropped the dish he was holding! "That would've broken for sure!" Norman exclaimed. "I must be more careful in the future." He scolded himself "curiosity can kill the cat."  

After the whole kitchen fiasco, Norman stood in front of the wall where the calendar hung, and said goodbye to March. He excitedly held his breath and flipped the page to April. The picture was of a tiny brown kitten. "I never would've guessed!" Norman was absolutely surprised but pleased. He pinned up the page and grabbed a pen. "Better get a pencil" Norman realised. Carefully, he wrote in his dentist appointment time for the 10th. He simply couldn't wait to write in it again. "At least I have the end of the day to look forward to." Norman thought "Then I can draw a big 'X' for the finished day!" Suddenly, the sun shined through the window, and Norman's day seemed a whole lot brighter.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4cvoe5/norman_changes_his_calendar/] createDate=[1459546906] score=[8] numComments=[1]>

</thread><thread title=[Another Tuesday at the office] author=[tinycatsays] text=[*Inspired (and potentially spoiled) by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CatsInBusinessAttire/comments/5u30r3/a_tough_tuesday_at_the_office/)*

----

Yet another Tuesday had flown by.  Norman reflected on his activities through the day.  He had arrived at work a few minutes early, just enough to avoid the traffic his later colleagues always complained about, but not by enough to avoid driving past a few stopped cars that had apparently collided.  Even now, as he prepared to leave the office, Norman felt a twinge of guilt that he hadn't stopped to help.  *They were standing around and inspecting the damage,* he told himself again, *and it didn't look severe at all.*  He didn't want to be late for work, or worse, contribute to another accident by behaving unpredictably on the road.

He adjusted his tie, wishing his manager had told him that it would be unnecessary.  He'd had an interview that morning--an unexpectedly-informal "meet and greet" with an applicant for a team that Norman worked with somewhat regularly.  This new guy, Jesse, had big shoes to fill, Norman thought; Marie had her documentation process down to a science.  Norman had often asked her for help with his own work on occasion.  He doubted Jesse would be as helpful.  (But, he had to admit, Jesse would be more effective than a vacant position.)

The rest of Norman's morning had been spent sorting emails.  One of those networking sites had sent him quite a few messages about openings at nearby offices.  He wondered if it was true that he could get a pay increase by switching companies... But his benefits were very good, and last year the company bought him a new, more ergonomic chair.  It was quite comfortable, once he'd broken it in a bit.  He deleted the notifications.

At lunch, Norman had planned to meet Lisa at the diner across the street, but when he arrived, he found a text from earlier in the day saying that her boyfriend had made last-minute plans, so she couldn't make it.  His usually-social lunch was much quieter and much quicker than usual, so he popped over to the shops for a few minutes.  It was nice, he decided, to stretch his legs a bit during the lunch break.  Perhaps he would join one of those office walking groups.  He was going to pass the pet shop when he remembered that his cat hadn't received a Valentine's present.  That wouldn't do!

Norman didn't want to take too long picking out a toy, but he felt certain Norman was sick and tired of all the same mouse and bird toys over and over.  He was about to give up when he spotted the perfect choice.  He chuckled to himself at his joke, and took his items to the checkout.

The afternoon was uneventful.  Many of his coworkers left early, leaving Norman and only a few others in the large space.  Norman liked his coworkers, but he enjoyed the solitude as well.  He felt very efficient in the quieter office, and wished that he had just a little more work to do.

During his downtime, he checked on the delivery status for the flowers he'd bought.  The online tracker reported that they were delivered to a person at his ex-wife's house.  He smiled, hoping she was the one who had received them.  She had chastised him for buying her flowers the first few times he did it, but either she had decided to enjoy them as he intended, or to ignore them.  He preferred to imagine the former, especially since he started signing them Norman Jr.  He knew Junior didn't have the spending money, but Norman felt like it was a nice gesture that his son would make, given the opportunity.

Now, after writing down a brief account of his daily activities, Norman was finally ready to leave the office.  He removed his tie the moment he got outside, and drove home with it piled in the passenger seat, next to the bag from the pet shop.  He was relieved to see both vehicles from that morning were gone.

When he got home, he went inside before remembering his tie and Norman's new toy, and had to run back out to his car for them.  "Norman!" he called.  "I've got a present for you!"  Norman lifted his head and sniffed, uncertain what his human's excitement was about.

Norman brought the bag over to his cat, and pulled out two items.  "Now we can end the day together, buddy!"  He scratched the cat's head, and then put the new collar--a bow-tie collar!--around Norman's neck.  "I took mine off early, but I won't make you wear this one very long," Norman commented with a smile.  "And here's your drink!"  He presented a stuffed wine bottle to Norman, who rubbed his cheek on it before allowing his human to place it next to him on the couch.

Norman went to the fridge and got his leftovers ready for dinner, then grabbed a beer and went to sit on the couch with the cat.  He turned on the TV, and looked over at his feline buddy.  Norman was curled up with the wine bottle.  Norman decided that this was a very good day.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5u5j1z/another_tuesday_at_the_office/] createDate=[1487163957] score=[7] numComments=[0]>

Setting his alarm forward by fifteen minutes was almost exhilarating, however when Saturday rolled around, Norman woke up at his usual time of 06:50. His briefs had become twisted during the night and were uncomfortable, so he slumped out of bed, slid on a pair of socks and plodded into the bathroom.

Norman picked his electric razor up and lowered it again when he looked in the mirror. With a finger, he prodded at the limp flesh beneath his chin, his shoulders slumped forward. With two hands now, he tucked the fatty paunch away out of sight and examined his face for a moment. Norman left the bathroom and returned with a roll of sticky tape. He snapped a piece of tape off and wrapped it under his chin as though it were a strap for a bicycle helmet. A few more pieces of tape here and there and Norman was able to see his whole neck again. The bathroom light glinted off the glossy tape, ruining the illusion, so Norman sighed and removed the tape which was a painful affair.

He looked in the mirror again, now at the red marks on his face from the sticky tape then smiled and shook his head. He gave his extra chin another poke, smiled a little wider as his chin wobbled about and he started to shave.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/56sfy5/norman_fights_his_double_chin/] createDate=[1476141259] score=[7] numComments=[0]>

Norman didn't drink coffee because the health defects caused by caffeine. He kept the machine given to him by his ex-wife. He didn't want to seem rude.

He watched sportscenter for 30 mins while he ate breakfast (Oops! All Berries!). It was nice to deflect water cooler talk with a quick statement about the top play of the day. The rest of the other 25 minutes  was in case his cubical neighbor Stan Luo was feeling talkative. The next 30 mins he showered flossed and combed over his hair. He had rocked a comb over for 10 years and wasn't about to let his co-workers know he's balding. 30 mins til work he leaves. "Bye Norman."

15 mins early Norman is really happy. He can sit in his car and listen to his podcast. Trumpcast was of particular interest today. Not a political person Norman wanted to be informed on the candidate who he would be voting for this year. Raised a Republican he wasn't about to change his ways now. The guilt of  being wrong for so many years could only worsen his depression. He still worried about having voted for the decriminalization of marijuana, that was done for Junior. Strayed away from his conservative intuition for the hope for a better future. Maybe Junior should have a bigger say anyways it is his future...

Anyways his boss finally showed up 5 mins before work. Norman hopped out his car, greeted his boss with a "Good morning." and a terse handshake. His boss nods; usually talkative, but he can't seem to remember Norman's name. They enter; now Norman is relaxed. Some of his co-workers would joke that it's a cube prison. Norman enjoyed the seclusion and safety. Today Stan wasn't there. He managed to visit the water cooler when no one was there. He left 5 mins before 5 Pm avoiding the parking lot traffic.

</thread><thread title=[Norman has an Unpleasant Encounter on the Bus] author=[bobusdoleus] text=[Norman didn't previously think that time could slow to such a crawl.

'If ever I am worried about life being too short and mortality too imminent,' Norman considered, indulging in a rare spot of philosophical meandering, 'I simply must give this man a call.'

He knew the man's name, now, of course – Derrik Berkshire-something – as well as the names of his three nieces, his two dogs, his favorite band, and, embarrassingly, the pet names he used for his testicles. (Lefty and Clarissa. Derrik flattered himself 'quaint.')

Ever since he took his bus seat, Norman abstractly dreaded the notion of someone sitting down next to him, and this encounter was a prime example of why.

It must have been forever and six months, by Norman's reckoning, and it wasn't his stop yet.

Before his mind could be cluttered further by increasingly-personal details of Derrik's daily routine, Norman resolved to find something else to occupy his attention – a decision he would come to regret almost immediately. His wandering gaze latched upon a drooping bit of saliva navigating its way down Derrik's chin. It was a large droplet, glistening, heavy – did Derrik really not notice it? He must have. *Surely I must say something,* Norman thought, but the very idea of broaching the subject filled him with that familiar sensation of abstract dread.

It wasn't Norman's stop yet.

Norman lost the thread of the conversation. It became evident that all he really needed to do was nod occasionally, and Derrik was content to rattle away. Norman felt a pang of guilt, perfectly aware that he was being at least somewhat rude, and put in a half-hearted effort to re-immerse himself in the tidal wave of inconsequential anecdotes flooding out of Derrik's mouth, but kept finding his perceptions drawn instead deeper and deeper into that large and ponderous bead of saliva.

There were worlds, galaxies spinning inside that bead. It shined, star-filled, with every passing street-light. Norman has identified and named ten constellations, and it still wasn't his stop yet.

*It must fall off of his chin at some point,* Norman thought. He'd look away, but he couldn't – he was, ostensibly, in a conversation. *If the bead would fall off, I'm sure he'd notice, and wipe his face. I could stop looking at it.* But the saliva clung tenaciously to Derrik's face. It would wobble occasionally; Each time, Norman was filled with hope, and mild disappointment as it refused to move further.

Derrik became angry about something. The change in tone prompted Norman's attention. It appeared that Derrik convinced himself that Norman was a supporter of some political party or other, a notion Derrik found concretely distasteful. His tone got louder, his gestures more wild, the flow of saliva from his mouth increased. Norman helplessly watched as Derrik worked himself into enough of an upset fervor that he got up and found another seat across the aisle. Time resumed, but inconveniently slowly, delayed by Norman's feelings of guilty anxiety at having been misunderstood and yelled at.

Norman's stop came. Before he left the bus, he cast a last, mildly apologetic look at Derrik. In that moment, the drop of saliva came tumbling down. Derrik noticed, and wiped his face.

Although Norman quickly forgot Derrik's name, everything about him, and that they even met at all, the profound sense of relief he felt at that moment would keep him reasonably chipper for most of the rest of the day.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/55hnwu/norman_has_an_unpleasant_encounter_on_the_bus/] createDate=[1475431366] score=[6] numComments=[0]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman gets a bald spot] author=[TehSonicWombat] text=["I'm so sorry Norman, but I'm afraid it must be cut out" explained Norman, carefully eyeing the clump of glue in the cat's fur.
Norman had been putting together a 1/146 scale model of the USS Missouri and Norman had thought it a good idea to jump onto the hobby table, sending the model crashing to the floor and knocking over the bottle of glue onto himself in the process.

Norman grumbled. "I'm terribly sorry for the mess, Norman, but it looked to me as though you'd put on one of the cannons improperly." Norman just looked down at him with his usual dopey expression. 

"I bet you're just as sorry as me, aren't you, Norman?" Norman responded.

After the broken model had been swept up and the glued fur had been cut away, Norman sat in his chair with Norman, both breathing calmly, the glow of the tv washing over them.

Norman closed his eyes and began to pur. Norman petted him gently.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/54ppzp/norman_gets_a_bald_spot/] createDate=[1474995772] score=[7] numComments=[4]>

<comment number=[2]author=[MattressCrane]text=[Good story, but can I make a few suggestions? There's a lot of grammatical issues here, and while I don't think a good Norman story can be judged solely on the strength of the writer, having better grammar certainly doesn't hurt.

"Norman thought that he would like a new job, and decided to look in the newspaper for a new one. Norman saw a job offering for work at a package company, but that made Norman nervous. He had only ever worked in office environments before. Norman decided that this job is far too adventurous and didn't apply. Norman is glad he stayed loyal to his workplace."

Pay attention to past tense! Norman is doing a crossword puzzle means that the event of him doing the crossword puzzle is right now. Norman *did* a crossword puzzle means that he had already finished the crossword puzzle and is now ready for tea.

</thread><thread title=[Norman Writes a Birthday Card] author=[theycallmechell] text=[Norman sat at the dining room table in silence and stared down at the birthday card in front of him. *Happy Birthday – Wishing you the Best on Your Special Day*, the card read. Norman had never been one for adding any personalized sentiments to greeting cards, and typically let the card do most of the talking. However, this one was for someone special.

It was late and all was quiet. Norman the Cat lay nestled by Norman’s feet fast asleep, and a dim light hung over the table - just enough for Norman to see the pen in his hand and the card on the table. *I need to focus*, Norman thought to himself. *But what should I say?* Norman rubbed his temples and closed his eyes, searching for words in his clouded mind. In doing so, Norman’s mind receded into distant memories. 

------------

Norman paced back and forth in the crowded waiting room. His mind was racing miles a minute and his heart felt as if it would come right out of his chest. He had never been this nervous before. Not even the time he accidentally brought his boss decaf coffee instead of caffeinated coffee when he was an intern fresh out of college. He slid his hands in and out of his pockets as he’d always done when he was nervous and tried to place his focus elsewhere. Sitting across the room, Norman noticed a young boy that lay fast asleep on his father’s lap. In spite of his trepidations, Norman stopped to admire the look of peace on the boy, and the smile on his father’s face as he stared down at him. His pacing stopped, his hands were motionless, and he became calm. 

“Norman?” a distant voice called, snapping him back to reality. 

“Yes,” Norman replied as he turned to locate the voice. 

“Congratulations, Norman. It’s a boy. Mom and baby are both healthy” the nurse said. “Follow me.” 

A sense of excitement welled up in Norman as he began to follow the nurse to meet his son for the first time. As he exited the waiting room he glanced back once more at the father and son, and sent a silent thank you for calming his nerves. 

------------

The fond memory faded from Norman’s mind and focused back on the present. Norman couldn’t help but think of how difficult the past year had been for he and his family. He went from coming home to a wife and son, to a cat and an empty one-bedroom apartment. In spite of it all, he was still proud of being a father – his greatest accomplishment. 

Just then, Norman knew exactly what to say. He opened the card and wrote: *Happy Birthday, Son. I’m so proud of you. With Love, Dad*

Norman closed the card and smiled. It was the easiest card he’d ever written. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4tjk31/norman_writes_a_birthday_card/] createDate=[1468935384] score=[6] numComments=[4]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman goes to the movies] author=[SorryKarlsson] text=[Norm woke up to a rainy sunday morning 'Just as well', he thought, he didn't feel like doing the gardening anyways, this was the perfect excuse to just sit back and watch some regular programming on his brand new flatscreen tv.
 
Norman sat down but before he could turn on his new acquisition he was remembered of his duties as a pet-owner by Norman's meowing. 'All right, all right, I'll fill your bowl' he said to his cat, slightly irritated.

When he entered the kitchen to feed his companion he remembered he hadn't eaten anything, he thought an omelette would do the trick, but he didn't have enough eggs, so he just grabbed some crackers and sat on the sofa, once more, to watch some satellite tv.

He turned his beauty on with pride, 'oh it must have wonderful definition, worth every penny, I'm sure' but the weather was terrible and the antenna seemed scrambled, he could only connect to espn, which would have been great if they were showing some golf or tennis, but there was a soccer match on, and Norm didn't like soccer one bit. 'Ugh, soccer, some luck I have, how could anyone be entertained by viewing something where so little happens'. 

He figured he could take his grandson to the movies, so he called his son up, who said that the kid had a bit of a fever, and he wasn't going out, but Norm had taken a stupid risk, and had already bought the tickets online. 'Some luck I have, I knew I shouldn't have been so reckless'. He tried to find someone else to go with but his list of potential movie-goers was cut short by the fact that he had tickets to a children's filmed, and the fact that he had a semi-stale social life, but he chucked it all to the former.

He went anyways to see "Servile Tic-Tacs" by himself, he had bought the tickets, he would see the film. When he got to the booth he made a pass at getting a refund on his extra ticket, but his request was met with a sour face by the teenager working there, so he didn't push for it.

Norm thought the movie was a bit childish, but his grandson would love it.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4oczlz/norman_goes_to_the_movies/] createDate=[1466107790] score=[7] numComments=[4]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman makes a movie] author=[jzigsjzigs] text=[The year was 1993, and Norman took his son Norman to see the new movie "Jurassic Park."  Though it frightened Norman, Norman loved it.  Norman was so inspired by Mr. Spielberg's masterpiece, he decided to take his own crack at it.

Norman devised a plan.  First, he got out his camcorder, and made sure it had fresh batteries and tape.  He also located two empty paper towel rolls he'd been saving.  The next step was going to be a little trickier, but Norman hoped for luck.  Norman put out some old newspaper he topped with cat nip for Norman, and several packs of Fun Dip for Norman.  The two got quite riled up; Norman wondered if they would ever settle down.  Finally Norman's son Norman fell asleep, with his head on Norman's belly.

Now! thought Norman.  Norman moved as soundly as he ever had before.  He carefully grabbed the cardboard paper towel rolls and gently placed them over Norman's ears.  With the camcorder finally rolling he whispered, "She was my favorite when I was a kid.  Now I see her, she's the most beautiful thing I ever saw."

</thread><thread title=[Norman's day] author=[[deleted]] text=[Norman stared vacantly out of the back of the filthy public transportation bus window. Without meaning to, he had found himself slipping into a state of mind of which he did not often venture into often, for good reason. “What are my greatest accomplishments in life? Norman wondered. “where am I going from here”? He thought of that one time he single hand-idly wiped out all of the flies in the office in the span of an afternoon. Sighing glumly, Norman realized that this was not the kind of accomplishment he was looking for. As the bus neared the stop nearest to Normans single bedroom home, he slowly rose off of the cracked, dusty seat. 
Later that night, Norman lay in bed after a long day of typing up financial council and report forms. Spying a lone stranger walking the sidewalk outside, he thought back to the conversation he had had with Tau-Lu about refilling the ink cartridges in the printer when they ran out. Several co-workers always forgot to refill the printer, and that small hiccup in the smooth, bland day irked Norman. However, he was able to quickly move on from the interruption, and continue in his arduous but important task of typing up reports. Resuming work was a comfort for Norman, something he liked to think about when trying to fall asleep.

	
At precisely 6:35 AM, Norman stepped unto his regular bus route, and walked to the back of the bus, adjusting his broken glasses as he went. Norman had bent the frame of his glasses two months prior, after falling unto the metal floor of the bus. He had never gone to get them repaired, as he did not want to break his schedule unless necessary. Doing so is never comfortable.  Norman sat in the same seat every day, twice a day. Everyone on the bus line knew that the second-most aisle seat to the back was to be used twice a day, every day, by Norman. After a short trip to the corporate office, Norman ascended the elevator swiftly, arriving on time. Norman was greeted by glances, and a few whispered “hello’s” from the HR department as he passes by on the way to his cramped office. Checking the printer machine outside of the door labeled “NORMAN”, he was pleased to note the ink cartridge was nearly full, a welcome surprise. Norman shuffled into the small office, moving the chair back slightly to make room for the door to be opened. Sitting down, Norman pulled up his e-mail account. Already he could see a few spam e-mails addressed to him. Most came from the travel agency a few cities away, of which Norman made the mistake of breaking his normal schedule to go visit. He was less than thrilled with the prospect of travel after seeing all of the smiling hordes of people on the brochures, and left the brightly colored office with haste, to resume his schedule. But one email caught his eye. It was different for the rest. Norman took a small, calculated risk, and opened the email. Inside was a block of text inviting him to a new group therapy session beginning this Tuesday, and continuing once a week. Norman gave it a small amount of thought before deciding that it was not for him, and sending the email to the trash bin, to be deleted every thirty days with all other threads and spam he had no use for.

Loping awkwardly out of the large office building with his worn briefcase, Norman hopped onto the bus. But not his usual line. Today was Tuesday, and after several days of thought, he had decided to attend the therapy session after work. It pained him to set aside his schedule, but with some healthy reasoning, Norman decided that the session could not do any harm. As a plus, he wouldn’t have to be around all of the people in the group for very long before he had to return home to rest before work the next day. Norman ambled to the back of the bus, only to find a large woman wearing a flower print dress and sun hat sitting in his usual seat. Norman slunk unhappily to the other side of the aisle. Already he knew that taking the time out of his schedule for this was a bad idea. 25 minutes later, Norman had arrived at the grand entrance to the “Samson and Koch Center for Mental Well-Being”. The name was too long, in Normans opinion. It was loud and bold, and took up a large amount of the front of the bricks above the doors. Norman sighed deeply as he walked in, noticing already a circle of chairs, 85% filled. Shuffling to the circle, he glanced suspiciously at the people on either side of his chair. They looked fairly innocuous, so Norman took a seat, glad not to be under judgment and scrutiny.

Already he felt out of place in his formal work attire, as most of the people here seemed to be men in their 20s – 40s who smelled strongly of alcohol and marijuana, and who looked decidedly unpleasant. The other half of the group looked to be made up of single mothers, a few of whom had to bring their small children along out of the need for a babysitter, but no money to pay one. “If all goes well”, thought Norman, “I may be able to leave without having to speak much”. Much later, after the sun had sunk into the horizon, Norman reflected on his life once more. He decided everything was just fine, for now.

Norman wanted to show his son how he too could be current. So he ordered a new chair about three weeks ago, which was longer than the given two and a half weeks for arrival. He was anxious to get it. While sitting in his old sofa recliner petting Norman, he dialed the number to the chair company. He waited anxiously while the phone rang, and was pleased when it was picked up on the fourth ring, and not on the third. Norman had a small distaste for odd numbers. He explained the situation to them calmly, and then chuckled to himself when they repeated the address. They had mistaken one of the numbers in his address for one of the house's across his street. The chair company told Norman they would correct the problem, and bid him a good day.

</thread><thread title=[Norman takes two chips.] author=[SamuraiPanda201] text=[The week had been a long one for Norman. Not literally, of course, as all weeks were the same length, he thought. But there had been a lot of catching up work to be done with the extended holiday weekend the week before. It was Thursday, and 11:59am, and Norman thought he had earned a treat for himself and was going to go on his lunch hour a minute early. He reminded himself to leave a minute later at the end of the day to make up for it.     

Norman went down to the cafeteria, even though he wasn't buying any food from down there. A couple of the tables were quietly occupied, and at one sat Kyle with a couple other people from the marketing department. Kyle was telling a story, and laughing loudly. The laugh was always the same volume and duration, no matter the quality of the joke, Norman thought as he attempted to walk by to a far table in the corner.    

"NORMAN!" Kyle bellowed, a smile on his face. Norman slowed in front of their table. "We NEVER see you down here!"    

Before he could answer, Kyle held the bag of potato chips he had been eating from up to Norman, "Chip?"    

Norman thought for a moment and throwing caution to the wind decided just one. As he reached in though, he realized there weren't too many chips left, and Kyle was holding the bag in such a way that he couldn't quite get his finger and thumb properly in to grab just one chip. What felt like an eternity passed by as Norman struggled for a grip. He felt the eyes of the marketing folks upon him, even though one was absentmindedly scrolling through his phone. He wasn't sure if Kyle could feel the length of time, but he was attempting to remain calm without seeming like he was blaming Kyle for the grip on the bag. It was Norman's lack of foresight, after all.   

Quickly and suddenly, his finger and thumb settled on two different chips and managed to bring them both to the surface. His panic faded into guilt. He'd only been offered one and was now unsure of what to do, but Kyle was already saying something about letting him know what he thought about the flavors, as there was some sort of contest going on.     

Norman though was lost in thought as he walked away to his table. He now had nowhere to put this second rogue chip, and he certainly wasn't going to eat both at once, not with this mystery flavor going about. It had been a long time for Norman since lunch had kicked off so uproariously. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4bq4vc/norman_takes_two_chips/] createDate=[1458820751] score=[7] numComments=[1]>

***
One of the perks of saving forty dollars a month on Norman’s rent was having to use the buildings laundromat facilities. It was in the lobby of the apartment complex, with a long draped curtain separating the front desk clerk and mailboxes from the washing machines and driers. Norman didn’t mind waiting in the designated seating area, as it gave him plenty of time to contemplate what he would rather be doing once he returned to his home. Norman day-dreamed about what sort of day-dreaming he would do back in the comfort of his recliner, a cat in his lap and a tea in hand.

Norman was caught mid-smile as the curtain was pushed open, a small head peeking through, looking square at Norman. Soon the head disappeared back into the fold, and Josie, Frank’s wife, entered the room with a basket of laundry. The little girl followed closely, wary of Norman in the corner.

“Norman, right?” Josie said as she loaded the laundry into a machine. “I didn’t realize you lived in the building too.”

“Yes, I live just a few doors down from you.” Norman said matter of factly, in a certain way that made it hard for Josie to continue a conversation. She nodded, inserting fifty cents into the machine. 

“I’m sorry about that night,” Norman started, “I usually don’t drink. It was a special occasion.”

“Not for Frank…” Josie retorted. “I’m sorry too, I suppose. I was just angry at my husband. It was his birthday and Amber here made him a cupcake and… Sometimes I wish he was just more considerate.”

Norman shook his head in agreement. Amber busied herself with the candy dispensers, checking to see if anything had been forgotten.

 He thought about the promise he had made to himself that night; to save Frank’s marriage. It seemed so silly in hindsight, and now, speaking to a reasonable and not at all villainous Josie, Norman was even less certain of what he could do.

</thread><thread title=[Norman tries Warby Parker] author=[alexbolster2] text=[Norman was listening to his favorite podcast "CSI Talk". He enjoyed learning about the inter complexities of the plot and what may be on the horizon for his  favorite TV characters. He continued to listen to the commercials even though he could have easily pressed the 30 seconds button a few times, but since he wasn't a patron he felt he would be cheating the makers of the podcast. He had heard all the ads before, but today there was a new one. 
    
 "Hey guys I've had the same glasses for years. Partially because I hate shopping and I have no clue what is fashionable. But earlier this week I was introduced to Warby Parker. They sent me 5 pairs of glasses of the trendiest glasses all for under $100 dollars. With a 1 week return policy if I was not satisfied. Of course I have to admit I was impressed and now have a new pair of glasses that get complimented almost every day." 
     
  Norman could not  help, but be intrigued by this offer. He was in a very relatable situation to his favorite podcaster. He liked to imagine they would be good friends. His calm never over zealous voice matched Norman's temperament and their  frugal behaviour seemed to be akin. And of course Norman hated shopping too. Norman thought about how he had the same glasses since he had last went shopping with his ex-wife she really seemed to like them, but no other women had ever complimented them. He went to work and mulled this offer. A week later after Norman had heard and renegotiated this offer multiple times. He gave in to the excitement of this investment. 

The package arrived. He decided for every week day he would wear a different pair of glasses. The first day of work that week his heart was pounding as he entered his office. Luckily no one noticed. The next day again no one seemed to notice or didnt care. He was relieved, but perplexed he had spent his money too frivolously to garner some attention right? The next day his cubical neighbor Stan  mentioned his glasses and even complimented them. Though Norman was flattered those glasses wouldn't do either. That was not the attention he wanted (he only wanted attention from the fairer sex). The fourth day he saw Lisa for the first time this week (just now realising this, he had been so focused on his experiment). She didn't notice his big change; he was losing hope. 

The last day he questioned if he shouldn't even risk trying the last pair, but since he had ordered it. He felt obligated to try all the glasses or else he would be lying, when he returned the glasses. He wouldn't know if the last pair would have satisfied him or not. Norman's moral obligations almost always out weighed his fears. (He would always return a strangers wallet unless they looked like a thug or were scarily large in which he would drop it off at the police station) The last day of the work week. He hoped no one had noticed this last change he was almost home free. How stupid wasting a $100 dollars, when he had a perfectly fine pair all along he thought. At the end of the day in rare occurence he saw Lisa as he was about to enter his car. She was about to enter her's. In all the clamity of the week he didn't even realise he had parked next to her, which he usely avoided so he didn't seem like he was desperate for her attention. 
   "Hey I Norman. I just wanted to say I like your new glasses." Said Lisa bashfully.
     Norman smiled and thanked her. Then entered his car and proceeded home. He looked at his self in the mirror and thought I guess my ex-wife was right. He returned the Warby Parker glasses the next Monday.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5d3kgz/norman_tries_warby_parker/] createDate=[1479257789] score=[6] numComments=[6]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman kills a civilian in a video game.] author=[PunchMeat] text=[She had been a middle-aged woman, a bit heavyset, wearing a pair of khaki shorts and a Hawaiian shirt, flagging a taxi at the side of the road. Now, she lied twisted on the asphalt, framed between the tire tracks left by Norman’s character’s stolen cab. He stared at her, both of their mouths agape, as she rested in a widening pool of red while a stack of bills floated above her.

Norman put the controller down to catch his breath.

He had seen plenty of murders in his life - an incalculable amount of murders, really - on CSI. He liked to think that he had an immunity to them by now. Sure, when witnessing a murder his gut would still sink and his palms would still sweat, but it had been years now since he had thrown up.

But this was different. It marked the very first time he himself had committed murder. Technically manslaughter, but it still counted. And most frightening of all? He found it exhilarating. His heart raced. Adrenaline pumped through him. He had a sudden first-hand understanding of so many rap lyrics, and he felt cooler for it.

Then came the guilt, hitting hard and fast like a speeding cab at a virtual intersection. He had to lie down.

Questions flooded his mind. Why did he have to hit *her*? An old man stood just to the left. If he had tilted the thumbstick one-degree of arc further, it would’ve been the old man instead of her. Wouldn’t that have been more humane?

He wondered how he would feel if the roles were reversed. If, in some other game universe, she was the one who had sped through virtual traffic, while he got to play the character standing motionless at a crosswalk. He wouldn't have liked that at all.

With a whimpering sigh it dawned on him: this woman probably had a family back home who would miss her. Was she a mother? Did she have friends? Was there a favourite food she would never taste again? Just then Norman crawled onto Norman’s lap, and Norman thought, “Oh no! What if she has a cat who will never snuggle her again!?”

It was all too much.

As he pondered the digital woman’s life, he heard sirens slowly growing louder on his TV screen. He sat up and started for the controller, but thought better of it. Even when the police arrived and threw his character to the ground, slapping the cuffs on him, Norman refrained from fighting back. “No,” he thought. “Justice must be served.”

But a moment later, after an all-too-brief loading screen / prison sentence, the police released him outside the station. A light fine, that was it. And then he was free to go. Maybe they had bumbled the case, or he'd been set free because they hadn't read him his Miranda Rights. Either way, the wolf was back amongst the sheep.

Norman wiped his palms on his pant legs. He took a sip of his orange juice. Then, with a twisted smile, he reached for the controller. He chuckled. “Looks like this one… was a flat fare,” he quipped, three minutes too late.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/588w5x/norman_kills_a_civilian_in_a_video_game/] createDate=[1476887226] score=[6] numComments=[1]>

Norman just left the office 15 minutes after his shift was supposed to end. For the 5th time in 4 weeks, Debra rushed out of the office early saying she had something important to do and asked Norman to finish up her paperwork. 

As he exited the building, the light coming from the light-post let him have a glimpse of something shiny in the grass area a few meters away. 

"Hmm... what could it be? Maybe a quarter? Maybe a collector coin?" Norman thought to himself. Maybe it was good karma for doing another good deed for Debra, especially since he secretly doesn't even like her that much. He gave a little smile as he knew that it was in the direction he had to walk in to catch the subway.

And as he walked 4 meters, he looked around with moving his head to see if anyone was watching him. Nope, no one would judge him if he picked it up.

He squinted and took a closer look. Upon further inspection, Norman saw that it was a nickel. It looked pretty dirty with a mysterious brown stain on it too.

Norman looked away and  continued walking toward the subway direction. "Ah, it's only 5 cents... Not worth it", he thought to himself as he crossed the street.  ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/56d1j4/norman_and_the_mysterious_coin/] createDate=[1475895865] score=[5] numComments=[0]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Makes Time For Tea] author=[ligamentary] text=[Norman usually rushed about on Saturdays. Saturday was his day for errands. Between buying Norman's food, restocking on litter, groceries, and sending out any mail he needed before Sunday, there wasn't much leisure time left. 

But on a particularly busy Saturday, Norman found himself feeling a bit rushed and morbid. Recalcitrant to the normal routine, Norman announced to Norman that shoe shopping would just have to wait for next week. Today he was going to make time for tea. He hadn't had a full tea since he last visited his grandmother in Shoreditch several months earlier. 

Norman stroked Norman's spindly orange back as he sorted through his cupboards looking to scrap together a decent tea. He found a few slices of white bread left from last Saturday's shopping, and rolled them flat with a pin, like his grandmother used to. He couldn't find much in the way of salmon salad or cucumbers like his grandmother would serve on tea sandwiches. All he could find was some peculiarly round ham. It would have to do. He tore off the stale bits to feed to Norman while he slathered a thin film of mayonnaise on his bread and slid the ham into place. 

He found some pea green madeleines an air BnB guest  had left behind as a small gift. They were probably pistachio, not a flavor Norman typically cared for, but it would be a shame to waste them and the tea would probably soak out the flavor anyways. 

Norman decided to be fancy and use a real tea cup instead of a mug. He rinsed it in the sink to wash away any dust that had gathered. The kettle began to whistle and Norman chose a spicy mint tea to brew. 

He arranged his tea on the table and his cat on his lap and enjoyed a nice break before returning to his errands, carrying the warm memories of the hot tea. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/55mcwf/norman_makes_time_for_tea/] createDate=[1475502967] score=[7] numComments=[0]>

Norman always thought that 'Elon Musk' sounded more like a cologne for the elderly than a champion of the people, but fragrant or not the man was making some seriously tantalizing projections. Norman rarely engaged the footrest feature on his Lazyboy recliner, but as his mind started painting visions of airlocks and red rocks on the walls of his brain, he pulled the brown wooden lever and sank into the leather just as his father used to after a few post work beers. The only true difference between the Lazyboys was the smell of smoke that clung to the former, and the lack of children that clung to the latter. After finally deciding whether two wicker chairs and a matching table, or a sculpture made from a Mars rocks should be the centre-piece of his new foyer, Norman realized what time it was, ten past 21:00 and Norman still hadn't had his insulin shot. Norman sprung to his feet, walked across the apartment to his fridge and retrieved Norman's medicine.

"They'd never take you to mars, Norman. They wouldn't be able to provide you all your medicine. And think about all the other cats that would apply, so much more handsome and intelligent.

It had been recommended to him by the cashier at the book store, but after reading a couple chapters Norman had decided he wasn't in love with the style, or the main character for that matter. But today, he decided, he would finish the book. Norman mewled loudly from the other room. Oh goodness, how could Norman have forgotten? He was in the middle of getting Norman's breakfast!

After getting Norman's food Norman realized that he himself had not eaten yet. Fixing himself a light breakfast of oatmeal and fruit, Norman looked around his kitchen in dismay. Several takeout bags littered a corner of the room. *What a mess!* Norman thought. The whole room would clearly have to be cleaned. Better yet, the whole apartment! Norman's litter box could use a good cleaning too, as well as Norman himself.

With the apartment and Norman thoroughly cleaned Norman settled into his armchair exhausted. Glancing at his trusty VCR Norman noticed the time, nearly 4PM! How fortuitous for Norman, just in time for the Sunday CSI block. Norman settled into watch only to fall asleep, tired from all the cleaning.

Waking abruptly Norman saw the fading words "Executive Producer Dick Wolf" on his TV screen. A little frustrated, Norman decided that it must be time for dinner. He fed Norman and fixed himself a nice, healthy Sunday meal, and settled into to get a head start on his work for Monday. *Always better to be prepared than to procrastinate*, Norman thought.

His work done, Norman turned to Norman and said, "Wow Norman, what a productive day we've had!"

Inside Norman was watching a War film on TV.

Norman considered what life would have been like had he followed his Father's footsteps and joined the military.


Norman felt he had always been a slight disappointment to his Father.

Whereas Norman's Father had been captain of the High School football team, Norman had been captain of the chess team.

Norman's Father had delighted in telling anyone who would listen about his sexual conquests before he met Norman's mother, Norman only knew the touch of one woman and she left him for a younger man.

Norman looked over to the picture of his Father on the mantlepiece, fit and active well into his 80s. Norman looked at himself, podgy, 50-something and breathless just climbing the stairs to bed.

"I'm going to get fit" Norman thought.
Standing up, Norman felt his back click and that twinge in his knee he couldn't remember getting.
"Maybe tomorrow then" thought Norman, settling back down into his chair infront of the TV and petting the head of Norman, his cat.

The cats eyes fell on a corner of the living room to where discarded running gear lay on an unused chair, countless tomorrows had already come and gone for Norman, this would just be another knew Norman, the cat.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/55khz3/norman_considers/] createDate=[1475474306] score=[7] numComments=[0]>

Norman slept on the left-hand side of the bed last night, as to wear the mattress evenly. He was particularly thankful for this as the alarm clock's display screen was quite bright and often startled him while his eyes adjust. 

Norman went into the kitchen to prepare breakfast. He fancied boiled eggs and toast. "Boiled eggs are the most effective and efficient form of eggs", he quirked at Norman. But Norman only had one egg left in the box. "That's strange, I'm usually well aware of how many eggs are left, and an odd number too." But then he remembered that on Thursday he had used three instead of two eggs for his omelette. Norman was usually a two-egg kind of man but on this particular Thursday, he had walked to and from work as it was rather sunny for a late Autumn day, and decided he needed the extra protein. 

Sunday was also proving to be sunny, so Norman decided to walk to the store to buy more eggs. The store opened at 10:00 so Norman decided to leave then, as by the time he arrives, it would definitely be open. "10:10, I would estimate as my time of arrival." 

Norman put on his coat, but left his scarf behind. He was walking on the sidewalk for around five minutes or so before he came to a road. A crossing guard was on patrol to ensure the safety of passing pedestrians. The crossing guard smiled at Norman as he waved him across the road. Norman looked left and right and could not see any traffic for a while. "Thank you for your help", said Norman to the guard.

Norman pet Norman, slowly, staring into his fur vacantly. CSI was having a commercial break. He wondered what he could have done different. What in his life could he have changed?

He thought of his wife, and the son they created. He thought of his influence, his autonomy as a human being. He could have encouraged his son to go to college, he could have gone to college himself. He could have been someone.

Something struck him. Something he had never thought of before.

Would he be remembered?

</thread><thread title=[Norman's sleepless night] author=[levilisko] text=[Norman rolled and turned on the bed with the lights out and the blinds closed, he was tired, but anxiety kept him awake, things were not going so well with his new client and the next morning he would have a meeting with his manager to talk about "results". 

Norman lied there with his mind racing about how he could had made things different the last month or so, he realized  that it was no use thinking about the past in that situation and that the more sleep he lost the worst his situation would be in the morning, a thought that only made him more anxious and less sleepy.  

As sleepiness left him completely , Norman reached for his cellphone on the nightstand only to drop it on the floor, he cursed silently three times and reached for the cellphone on the floor grabbing it easily this time, checked the hour and left it in the stand again: 3:33 AM, how amusing he thought - Norman always found it a bit amusing when he checked the time and the numbers are all identical.

Feeling worked up by his recent exasperation he stood up and tried turning the lights on , only to find they weren't working - "darn, another problem to solve tomorrow".  Norman then blindly walked to the bathroom, only to find that those lights weren't turning either, "maybe the power is out?" - he thought to himself realizing that his phone was still in his hand and he could use it to light the way Norman taped twice on the phone's screen and the screen shone brightly, showing him the time: 3:33 AM, "that can't be!?", he thought for a split second only to realize he was exactly in front of the bathroom mirror where a sickly version of himself looked back at him: pale and bald, the light shone on mirror Norman's face showing deep dark circles around his eyes, a greenish-white skin tone contrasted and made apparent dark veins all over his body and when Norman opened his mouth to scream, he could see a toothless mouth with a dried out worm for a tongue, no scream was heard... 

The cellphone light turned off... 

Norman opened his eyes, his heart was racing, the sunlight was visible through the slits on the blinds,  he  reached for his cellphone on the nightstand only to drop it on the floor, cursed silently three times and reached for the cellphone on the floor, he taped twice on the screen and the hour was 08:33 AM,  Norman would be late for the meeting.

</thread><thread title=[Norman climbs a tree] author=[nuclear_science] text=[One balmy evening Norman went for a walk around the block. It was something that he liked to do every so often under the pretense of staying active. As he walked past his neighbors’ houses he liked to peek in to see what they were up to. He never stared outright but instead kept his face forward and let his eyes glance over quickly. Many of them had tall hedges or fences that were impossible to see past but inevitably they would have a gate that was low enough or was slatted enough to see through. He would see people unpacking their shopping, talking with their family as they got home, or most often just undulating light reflecting off the walls as people watched their TV’s. It made him happy to see people enjoying their routines bathed in the golden glow of their homes. It reminded him of how much he enjoyed curling up with Norman for CSI after dinner. 

That last thought made a pang of hunger shoot through his stomach. He was hungry, and it almost was time for CSI too. Norman quickened his pace and quickly got to his front door. All the lights were off. *Oh no! When I left the landlord was home but he must have gone out. How will I get inside?!* He fretted and called out but there was no response. *Maybe he left a window open*, he thought and proceeded to sidle down the narrow passage between his house and the neighbour’s. At the back of the house Norman could see that the landlord had left the upstairs bathroom window open which was conveniently close to a strong branch extending from a tree that Norman had not even contemplated in a long time. *I can’t believe I forgot about this tree. I should come into the back yard more often.* The tree had many branches which looked rather climbable and Norman could see a fairly straightforward path up the tree to the bathroom window. *Am I really considering this?* Norman had not climbed a tree since he was young. He remembered getting stuck up a tree once and after that he had never climbed again. But by now his stomach was eating itself and CSI was due start so it had to be done. Norman, slowly but surely, edged his way up the tree, testing every foothold before trusting his weight to it. *How embarrassing*, he thought as he crawled along the final branch on his belly, *I hope the neighbours don’t see me!* Finally he was at the bathroom window and able to slither through headfirst, landing his hands and then his feet safe on the bathroom floor. He sat there for a few minutes, waiting for the fuzziness in his head to pass, breathing hard.

The house remained dark as he made his way downstairs on trembling legs to the couch. His hunger was forgotten as the adrenaline continued to twist his belly. It seemed like he was sitting only a minute before he heard the key turn in the latch. *What terrible timing he has*, thought Norman and he turned his head to watch as the light flicked on and Norman stumbled through the door with a large shopping bag in his arms. 

“Hello Norman,” he said.

“It’s time for CSI,” said Norman, but Norman didn’t understand and went to put the shopping away.

“I got you some fresh meat,” and he spooned it out into Norman’s bowl before putting the milk away and setting a TV dinner in the microwave.

“Thank you, but I am not feeling well,” said Norman and waited for Norman to sit down. 

“Not feeling well, eh buddy?”

Finally, the TV was flicked on and a lap formed as Norman sat down. Norman stretched and climbed onto Norman’s legs, turned around once to curl into a ball and relaxed into his lap. Norman’s soft belly was in front of him and he soon found himself kneading the tissue into submission.

“Ow,” Norman yelped, quickly inhaling, “you’re so cute. It’s daylight savings today; I hope you had a good day,” he scritched him behind his ears.

Norman didn’t know what that meant but he felt the golden glow of lights and the TV flickered up on the walls. Norman did not think other people’s routines must be as good as his, although he did wonder why everything was an hour later today as he settled into sleep.

He had checked the bus schedule but it would get him there only 25 minutes before his appointment and he didn't want to keep the doctor waiting.  Even though it was just a yearly physical for insurance he wanted to be early in case the doctor had any questions for him.

He left work at 1:45pm, pleased that his files were in order and tomorrow would be fine even though he was missing 3 hours of work.  

After checking his mirrors and pulling out of the parking lot he deliberated on whether to drive through town or take the freeway.
"Well, I can save another 5 minutes if I take the freeway," he thought, knowing he would only have to travel two exits.

"DRIVE THE GO*%$&amp;*&amp;  SPEED LIMIT!  , YOU *(&amp;(**$%#$@&amp; .!," he heard someone shout!

He saw a red fancy car pass around him on the left (Norman NEVER drives in THAT lane) and then pull back immediately in front of him.

The driver of the  fancy red car immediately started erratically applying his brakes.  "Something MUST be VERY wrong," though Norman.

Norman's anxiety was extremely high and his face was flushed as he felt concerned for the driver of the fancy red car.  Something must be very wrong.  Yet, he took his exit and made his way to the Doctor's office.

Norman continued to think of the fancy red car driver and his distress as he watched the clock tick by, waiting several hours for the doctor.  

"I hope he is okay and his day get's better," thought Norman.

</thread><thread title=[Norman's E-mail.] author=[Gloriousstudent] text=[Norman was sitting on his couch, remote in hand when he remembered he had not replied to an e-mail which he had received earlier in the week. "Excuse me, Norman", he said to Norman as he slowly rose from the couch. He thought about how rude he had been by avoiding an e-mail sent to him. "Can't take people for granted" he said to himself. Norman promptly made his way to his new swivel computer chair. Norman was quite pleased with this recent purchase as it helped ease his back pain. 

Norman sat at the computer and in his haste, accidentally clicked on internet explorer instead of his desktop e-mail icon. Norman tried to remember his calming breathing techniques which he learned from his doctor in times like these. "What is this?' Norman exclaimed. Norman chuckled to himself softly as he remembered he had set his internet explorer icon to link directly to google. "Technology these days" he said to himself half pleased. 

Norman typed in "email" and pressed enter. Norman had never tried to access his e-mail in such a way, and was quite bewildered at all of the results to his seemingly straightforward search. He refined his search to "Norman's email" and yet again pressed enter. Sweat gathered on his brow as he once again scrolled.

While peering through, Norman came across something that looked like an article. "Reddit?" Norman said. He questioned if he should click the link to see what it was. Norman thought long and hard about if he should give into this little luxury, and decided that since it was a Saturday morning, he should treat himself to a little extra computer time. 

When Norman opened the link, he was quite confused. "Life of Norman?" .. He continued to read,in hopes to find his e-mail. The title read "Norman's E-mail".

</thread><thread title=[Norman goes flying.] author=[jmorlin] text=[Norman awoke to the sound of his alarm clock early one Saturday morning.  Normally he would refrain from setting an alarm on the weekends and enjoy the extra couple hours of rest, but today was an exception.  This morning he had an odd mixture of anxiety and excitement.  Norman was going flying.

Three months ago Norman had received a gift certificate on his birthday.  However, unlike a voucher at Starbucks or Target, Norman was hesitant to redeem this one.  This was gift certificate for a one hour airplane ride.

When it came to airplanes Norman usually tolerated them at best.  He felt they were good for traveling long distances, but he didn't much like long lines at security or being crammed in the middle seat on a 3 hour flight.  However, determined to try new things Norman got in his car and drove to the airport.

Norman walked into the office where the pilot was waiting.  He had Norman sign a couple papers and they were off, the butterflies in his stomach still flapping away.

"This is it?," thought Norman as he arrived at the plane.  It was scarcely big enough to hold two people and looked as if it was older than he was.  Norman wasn't sure it would fly, but at the risk of sounding rude he kept quiet as the pilot lead him through pre-flight checks.

Once in the plane the pilot handed Norman a spare set of headsets and started the propeller.  The pilot made a few calls on the radio and they were off, no backing out now.

The plane came rushing down the runway and as it lifted off Norman felt his stomach fly up into his throat.  After about 15 minutes of gazing out the window the butterflies in Norman's stomach had calmed down.  In fact he was just beginning to enjoy the flight when the pilot offered to let him fly the plane for a bit.  Norman hesitated, but then remembered he was here to try new things and took the pilot up on his offer.  Norman was hesitantly enjoying himself until a gust of wind took the plane and bounced it around.  The pilot took back control and Norman was startled, but no worse for wear.

After the pilot landed taxied back to the hanger, he asked Norman if he would like to return for another flight in the future, or maybe take some flight lessons.  After some pondering it for a few moments Norman declined the polite man's offer, deciding that today was enough excitement for one lifetime.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4bu3bf/norman_goes_flying/] createDate=[1458889929] score=[7] numComments=[0]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman gets robbed] author=[v13us0urce] text=[It was 9 P.M. on a Friday and Norman was getting home from work. He rarely went home this late, he had responsibilities, but this time his boss wanted him to stay late so he did. While walking he realised that he kind of liked walking at night, it was quieter and the air felt fresher.  Not wanting to be too late Norman decided to take a shortcut. Norman hadn't done this in a long time, he didn't like change. 
The shortcut was a bit darker than the main road but you could still see clearly. Waking across it Norman heard a noise, he quickly looked to his right but didn't see anything. Then he heard a voice from behind, it was a deep voice, but somehow calming, it reminded him of Liam Neeson. "Your wallet" the voice said. Norman froze. Sweat was rapidly forming on his forehead. He thought about running but he hadn't done that since that time a dog was chasing after him in the parking lot and that was very long time ago. "Do I even remember how to run?" he thought, but it was not the time to think, it was time to act. So he did. He ran, he could feel the adrenaline going though his body, he ran and he could feel the wind mess his hair, he ran not looking backwards,not even looking forward, he just ran. After about 30 seconds of running he collapsed. Norman looked back and could not see anyone. He felt relieved, proud even,he could feel his adrenaline draining and taking away all this energy. The cold wind on his sweaty face felt really nice. He got up and walked home while occasionally looking backwards. He got home, closed the door behind him and started laughing. Took off his jacket, placed the keys on the table and noticed that his wallet was missing.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5zwzxv/norman_gets_robbed/] createDate=[1489778325] score=[6] numComments=[2]>

An hour or two went by with this ordeal as Norman was petting Norman, but then something interrupted him, a sound.....then two....and three! ohh my! it was magic, the tranquility of his music, the monotony of it all, it was fitting (sorry for the hyperbole). So Norman decided to look for this music on the internet, and found some. Some were high, others low, some quite and some loud, some angry and some sad, but not any quite like what Norman had heard. After a while Norman gave up on his quest to find that normal sound. He went to an elevator, upon entering, he heard it. That was it! Norman couldn't contain his excitement and accidentally burst a grin. His body couldn't contain the emotions and he decided to move it....one finger, then two, and in a moment's drop his whole hand was tapping to the rhythm of the [beat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5PvBzDlZGs). Unfortunately, Norman had reached his floor, but in a desperate feat of freedom, he decided to stick it to the man, to go against the system, and press the buttons for another floor just to listen to that melody. After getting home he decided he would never do such a reckless thing, for the sake of humanity, but those moments of youth and rebellion will always live in his memory until the day h- ohh look! Another infomercial with that cool beat kids hear these days.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5l22d4/norman_in_search_for_music/] createDate=[1483108942] score=[5] numComments=[0]>

</thread><thread title=[Frank's Birthday (Norman and Frank, Part 1/9)] author=[MattressCrane] text=[For eight hours a day, five days a week, Norman sat with his back facing towards an equally middle-aged man named Frank. Frank was slender, balder, and far more quiet than Norman- whose own shyness was something not to be underestimated- and for the past nine years, the two men sat solemnly beside each other in the confines of their cubicle. In the morning they would say “Morning” to each other, and as they packed up their briefcases for the day, they would say “Evening”, even though both of them left the office at the same time, ride the elevator at the same time, and even wait at the bus stop at the same time. It didn’t help that they lived in the same apartment building, as well as the same floor.


Norman knew very little about Frank. Occasionally he would hear Frank discuss politics with Robert from sales, and from the amount of times Frank ordered in for lunch, Norman could tell he was a fan of Vietnamese food. Norman also knew that Frank had a wife named Josie, and an eight year old daughter named Amber. Norman felt that this was his one connection to Frank, if the two ever talked. Norman and his ex-wife divorced when Junior was only seven, and because of that, Norman was jealous of Frank. He was happy for him, but still, a part of Norman wished he were more like Frank.


The change of status quo occurred when Norman received an work-email on a Friday afternoon.


***
“Hello everyone,


Just a reminder that today is Frank Jenkins's birthday! Please take a moment in your day to wish him Happy Birthday!”
***

Norman hesitated. He quickly closed the email, just in case Frank saw it. It would spoil any surprise birthday parties, if anyone had happened to plan one for him. Norman then had to consider his options- say Happy Birthday to his face and risk stumbling over his words, or write a carefully worded, but less thoughtful, email? 

“Hey Norman,” said Frank as he swung his chair around, “it’s my birthday.”


“Oh really? Happy-birday,” Norman slurred unconvincingly. He wished that Frank had said that to him in an email instead. 
	
“Since it’s Friday, I’m looking for someone to get drunk with tonight. I don’t normally ask you, but all I know is I’m not getting home until it’s real late. You in?”


Norman scoured his mind for an excuse, but as his head swiveled slowly in deep thought, Frank took it as a nod of agreement.
	
“Great. Let’s start at five.”


Norman gulped in anticipation.

</thread><thread title=[Norman at Home Depot] author=[zadmarnoel] text=[“So which cordless screwdriver is the best?” said Norman.  The Home Depot employee (Bob) who had been having a difficult morning after a confrontation with his boss, took a deep breath and thought “not another one” 
“What kind of project are you going to tackle” he asked in his kindest voice? “I’m not sure” stated Norman, “I have just always wanted one,  I guess building Ikea furniture or hanging pictures on the wall?” he continued. Bob seeing an opportunity to get his sales numbers up expressed the benefits of an expensive Makita and the accompanying bit collection.  Norman was happy with his decisive purchase, no doubt fueled by the overzealous salesman.    Once home, Norman commenced with hanging a mirror that had been in the garage for years waiting to be appreciated. That salesman had also sold Norman some wall anchors, just in case, and Norman thought now was as good a time as any to put them to use.  He did some research on the internet as to their use and stared at the wall working up the courage to begin.  Norman looked on with a full belly and an inquisitive look wondering what Norman was up to.  Norman read and followed all of the instructions that came with the driver and was ready to begin. Norman carefully placed the anchor against the wall, placed the bit against the anchor and pulled the trigger.   Before he knew what was happening, the anchor was through the wall along with a couple of inches of the very nice Makita.  Norman stared at the wall and hoped his neighbor on the other side would be understanding.  Norman purred and circled his legs enjoying his self-induced back rub.  Norman looked down and smiled.

</thread><thread title=[There's a Prowler In Norman's Yard] author=[nightingaleeffect] text=[Norman was just washing a dish in the sink from a midnight snack of jelly toast when he noticed a rustling in the bushes. Shutting off his lights and peeking through the bay window blinds he saw a man in dark clothing creeping around his side yard. 

Concerned, Norman watched a few seconds more before ducking out of sight in a panic. He didn't want to be a rabble rouser considering the man wasn't technically doing anything wrong... but since he was on Norman's property Norman had valid license to ask the police to check things out. 

Norman made sure that his doors and windows were locked, closed his curtains, scooped Norman off the arm of the couch, and went to call from the handset in the bedroom. 

"911 what is your emergency?" Norman explained the predicament and they said they'd send a car to check things out. 

Norman sat on the edge of his bed and flipped through a tabloid magazine with the aid of a pen light while awaiting a return call. After an hour with no word or further disturbance, he drifted to sleep atop his covers. 

At about 2:00am, the phone rang, and Norman awoke with a start, while Norman stretched his claws and wiggled his ears in drowsy acknowledgement. 

"Hello Sir, this is the police department, I hope I didn't wake you. Just wanted to let you know the suspicious man you saw is a guest of your neighbors. He'd arrived late and wasn't sure which house he was looking for. Your neighbors want to extend their sincere apologies for any upset or confusion this may have caused you and your family, but in any case, we appreciate you calling it in."

Norman thanked the officers for keeping him informed and, with peace of mind, slept soundly through the remainder of the night. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/59sjgn/theres_a_prowler_in_normans_yard/] createDate=[1477656230] score=[5] numComments=[0]>

Norman had slept well the night before even but his brain fogged up. Norman pushed himself to finish up his report. It took a little longer than usual. He didn't have time to make his usual comments about the weather with Lisa or Robert because he was putting the final touches on his report as they were heading out.

On his way home, Norman skipped his usual bus stop to take the one three blocks down. He was hoping the brisk air would wake him up a bit. At home, Norman found himself nodding off over his tomato soup. The crackers he had bought because of a coupon were weird and tasteless. The soup didn't taste right without the buttery round crackers that he usually had. 

Norman meowed for his dinner, which was served a few minutes later than usual. Things are getting wild around here, thought Norman, as he rinsed out his bowl and spoon. 

Bed called to him but it was a good three hours before he normally went to sleep. Determined to stick to his regular schedule, Norman turned the tv on to watch CSI. He yawned and scratched Norman behind the ears. Norman was soon curled in a ball and napping peacefully on his favorite couch cushion. Norman nodded off too and had to rewatch the first few scenes so he could figure out what was going on. It was with enormous relief when he finally climbed into bed. The cool, crisp sheet had barely settled over him before he was out.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/58g66i/norman_is_sleepy/] createDate=[1476988915] score=[5] numComments=[0]>

<comment number=[2]author=[MattressCrane]text=[Hey, thanks man. Didn't realize people were paying attention to that series. 

Honestly, without giving away the ending too much, the main thing holding me back from finishing that series was the fact that I was planning to end it on a really, really low note. It would be rather sad, and because it takes 15 parts to tell, the impact would be tougher. I've just... Never willed myself to let Norman be so sad. Maybe I can still change it up, but I had a concrete plan for how to end that series the moment I started it. Same with my "Norman gets Cancer" series- depressing, but not quite in the way you'd expect. My problem is, as a writer, I'll start a storyline with one emotion, but by the end, I feel differently. And I never know if it's worth delving myself back into the mindset.

I can't promise I'll finish the series tomorrow, but I'll pick up my own drafts of it Sunday, alright? ]score=[2] </comment>

His fingers rest on a small slice of metal that would could be flipped if he decided to do it. Was it the right thing to do? Norman closed his eyes and made the decision. He pulled the tab. The cold sharp smell of soda, Coca-Cola, hit his nose. Immediately, he felt regret. Norman had already drank his allotted one can of Coke that day. He should not have opened the second. Now he had to make yet another decision. Clearly he could not violate his rule of drinking two Cokes a day. That would be blasphemous. Would he save the drink for later? The fizzy bubbles would dissipate, leaving a flat drink, completely unpalatable. But Norman was a man of honor. He had opened the can prematurely, he would be responsible for drinking it later, even if it would be terrible later. With a sigh of disappointment, Norman put the freshly opened can of Coke back in the refrigerator. Norman gets out a handkerchief and wipes his forehead.

Come Friday, when Norman decided to jean shorts and a jean jacket to work, he was called into his supervisors office. 

"Norman... How do I put this... We don't have casual Friday in this office." 

Norman realized his mistake. He just assumed that everyone had much more comfortable work clothes than he did and didn't feel the need to dress casually. Now that he thought about it, the poster that announced Casual Friday was held up by a giant monkey. He only dreamed it existed.

</thread><thread title=[Life of Yeng: Norman's Surprise Part 1] author=[DukeofDandelion] text=[Norman lifted his head from the faucet in full view of the mirror. He had just finished shaving and was reaching for a paper towel. It was then he noticed something important was very much absent in his reflection.  

He probed his off-color hands over his smoothed cheeks, completely awestruck at the new face staring strangely back at him. Short, black hair; squinted eyes; fat yellow cheeks; all features that were surprising to suddenly appear in Norman’s mirror in the middle of his routine. "This isn’t my face! But yet…" it seemed to fit snugly over his body. He probed it freely, moved the muscles easily without discomfort, as if he had practice wearing it before. "But where," he wondered dimly, "…my face, this isn’t my face. Why am I seeing this?" He was caught deep in the struggle to derive some reason from this anomaly. His whole mind engulfed itself in the paradox, and he did not realize that he was slowly backing away from the sink. Without knowing he had fallen, Norman woke hours later propped upright in the tub.

He soon came to with a throbbing headache and a tender sore on the back of his head. He probed the soft spot gently with is fingers, then, looking at his fingers, noticed that they were the same shade of off-white that had conquered his complexion earlier. 

"Oh Jesus. Please, why am I seeing this?" "Why does this have to happen now?" He whimpered loudly, the words rang painfully in his head. He stood himself up only to fall over, leaning on the bathroom door. He clasped his hand to his face, keeping out the light from hurting his head. "What is happening?" He whispered, tears trickling between his fingers. "There’s a reason; this isn’t just happening" he thought "There is a reason." He wiped his hand on a pant-leg and dimmed the bathroom lights. Standing in line with the mirror, he began taking a focused examination over his new face.

The probing began with his eyes- studying the color, the number of eyelashes, the pigment beneath the eyelids, the brightness of the blood vessels, and other minute details. He then moved to the nose, ears, mouth, hair, eyebrows, chin, forehead, and whatever was left of the face. Finally, he came to the conclusion which seemed most acceptable to him, in light of his findings.

"It’s just a dream. It’s just a dream" He told himself, turning away from the mirror. "This is nothing more than a dream, or rather a nightmare. Obviously I am still lying unconscious in the tub, and everything that’s happening now is just a product of that concussion. My mind is just confused." He took the train further "Perhaps even, I’m still lying in bed, and all this is just an elaborate way of signaling my brain that I had overslept the alarm." But with this invention came the expected epiphany: "But if I am suddenly aware of all this now, why haven’t I woken up?"  He left his bathroom and began pacing incessantly in his bedroom, attempting desperately to weave together again his unravelling dream-theory. "Perhaps another blow," he thought, "will do the trick." But he had to grapple with the possibility that he may be awake, and that it was his conscious mind that was ailing him. "There’s a chance I’m suffering from a nervous breakdown, that this is all part of some freak out. But then, what can I do?" But this idea didn’t satisfy him, for apart from the obvious symptom, his mind was working quite as it always had. 

He took to TV as his mind roamed farther into bleaker thoughts. But he couldn’t shake the terror bubbling from his gut. He went to the phone to dial 911, but soon realized, whether he was awake or not, there was no simple way of explaining his situation to an operator, not without sounding nuts.

As he walked into the kitchen he laid eyes on Norman who said, "Hey Norman, I was making dinner when I heard a mouse.

His local post office was being renovated so he had to take a crowded, noisy bus across town to mail a package.  It had been years since he had last been in this part of the city and he was amazed at all of the new establishments that had arisen.  Under his breath he read out some of the new stores as they passed by. "Forever 21....Pottery Barn... The Container Store...Chipotle... Steak &amp; Egger..."  

"Excuuuse me!" the large woman seated next to Norman shouted in his ear.  "No you didn't!"

</thread><thread title=[Norman calls noise control] author=[GILLIEOGOLD] text=[Norman lay in bed staring at the ceiling, as he had for the last... he looked at his clock. 3.24am. As he had for the last 5 hours.

As he rolled over and shifted his gaze to a solitary patch of light on the carpet, Norman began to feel angry. The anger grew. This wasn't right! Norman deserved a good nights sleep. The anger grew and grew, like a black bulge in the pit of his stomach. He hadn't felt this mad since... since... never mind. 

Norman threw back the covers, straining his shoulder. Ouch. He slipped his feet and gingerly stomped into the kitchen, not wanting to accidentally step on Norman.

The music was louder in the kitchen than in the bedroom. The bass rattled his mothers tea set. Norman scurried over to re adjust a saucer that was dangerously close to falling. Here, he could hear drunken yells. "LET'S GET FUCKED UP" he heard someone scream. It was followed by a chorus of "YEAH!"s. Norman shook his head. Young people these days. Didn't they realise that there were children in the neighbourhood, who would potentially pick up these words? Norman would never had let his son engage in such douchbaggery.

Feeling even more inflamed, Norman flicked the light switch. Adjusting his eyes to the bright burning, he clumsily scrabbled for the phonebook on the pedestal, next to the phone. He sat on the occasional chair and flicked through the pages. There. Under the Ns, he found 'noise control'. 

Holding his finger to the spot on the page, Norman reached for the phone. He pressed in the first few numbers, and froze. He erased them quickly. What had he been thinking? What a spoilsport. They were just kids having some fun. 

Norman smiled and closed the phone book, placing it neatly on the pedestal. 

But then again, wasn't he just as entitled to enjoyment (sleep) as they were? They had had their fun.

Norman opened the phone book again and pressed 'back' on his phone. He continued typing in digits, and was just about to press call, when a sudden realisation hit him.

What if they somehow found out it was him who put a stop to their party? 

He could see it now. A bunch of dangerous hooligans, sneaking across the lawn. 'Let's do a skux on his porch' they'd say, and they would. Disgusting.

He shuddered and closed the phonebook. The stakes were too high. Norman could do without sleep tonight. Before turning off the light, he wrote 'ear plugs' on his jotter.

</thread><thread title=[Norman Talks In The Locker Room] author=[nightingaleeffect] text=[Fresh off a spirited set of squash, Norman and his gym buddies were freshening up in the locker room. 

"How about Mendelson's serve, eh Norman? Could be gunning for the club championships." "I suppose so." Said Norman, folding his gym shirt into a neat geometric shape. 

"Did anybody see that receptionist out there?" Norman nodded "She reminds me of a young Marcia Fudge." "She's hot fudge on two bigs scoops!" Remarked one of the men. Norman nodded "She is comely, isn't she?" "You should ask her number Norman!" "Nah." 

Norman thought about the receptionist for a moment. Then he thought about what he'd had for lunch. Then he thought "I better shower at home so I can use my anti-dandruff shampoo." 

A silence ensued while the men changed back into their ordinary clothes. One began shaving in the mirror. "That new city councilman is a real crock, I think." An acquaintance of the group remarked from a far row of lockers. "Sure is. Taxes are already grand larceny without his radical mulch tax." Norman nodded and his friend chimed in "If anyone tries to tax my mulch I'll be over the border as quick as you can say your own name." 

Everyone mumbled in agreement. "All right then. See you all next week." Norman said with a nod. And the men went their separate ways to finish out the rest of their day. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/57f3tb/norman_talks_in_the_locker_room/] createDate=[1476456567] score=[4] numComments=[0]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman goes on a road trip] author=[alexbolster2] text=[Today was a special day. Junior had met Norman at his house, when Norman got off work. Norman thought of himself an expert trip planner. He never told Junior where they were going. He wanted it to be a surprise. Junior didn't seem to care as long as he got a 15 minute bathroom break every 2 hours or so. This rarely happened because Norman never planned a trip with a drive more the 3 hours. 

What made this trip so special was the fact it was only 1 hour away. Junior and him would have plenty of time to visit the various museums and best of all the biggest Goodwill in the state. Norman had saved up money all year for this, and planned on getting a new wardrobe for him and Junior. 

"Happy birthday and christmas!" Exclaimed Norman as they pulled into the Goodwill parking lot.

</thread><thread title=[Norman gets a letter from Castanza] author=[alexbolster2] text=[Norman was bored on a Saturday.  He checked his email. His inbox was filled with spam, lots of porn. He erased it all and reported all the sites. He worried one day someone would see his inbox and blushed at the thought. It was 12 PM  when the mail man usually delivered his mail, so he watched a recorded episode of CSI til it was safe to proceed to the mailbox. He usually procrastinated till he had to get his bills. To his surprise he had received a letter. When he entered his house, he hurriedly opened the envelope careful not to rip it. It read: 
"Dear, Norman
          Sorry for the scare the other day. I am not the type to pry into one's personal life. I am an old man and am overcome by my loneliness. I would like to conversate with you and properly apologize for the scare. Come over when you read this. If my car is in the driveway I'm home.
                                                Courtesy,
                                                                Castanza

P.S. Be prepared for dinner."

Norman wanted to decline, but figured he would dress up in case he couldn't go through with it. He didn't like to leave Norman alone on non-workdays. He waited til 4 to leave. He dressed nice, but too nice. He didn't want to appear eager. He looked out the window and saw a 63 corvette (of course Norman didn't know it was anything other than a red car. He wasn't a car guy or really any kind of guy. He had one hobby CSI). 

He knocked on Castanza's door. The door was opened almost immediately. Castanza hurriedly shook Norman's hand and said "Good you came we should be going now." Before Norman could even grasp, Castanza had already entered his car and revved up the engine. Castanza drove like a man on the verge of death. Norman would have said something but instead voided this notion, and instead chose to hold on for dear life. 

Scurrrt! (Italics) (Castanza didn't even have time to make a safe stop.) He acted not to notice Norman, but truthfully enjoyed watching Norman trying to hold himself together. "Hey bud you can open your eyes we're here." Castanza said sternly. Castanza couldn't help but smile as he asked "Have fun?" Norman nodded he would speak was to busy holding back vomit. He felt as though he met death and he was a good looking 65 year old man with a full head of hair. "Lucky punk." Thought Norman. Norman smiled that thought just added a dollar to his swear jar.

Norman looked up and felt his stomach drop they were at the Whiskey Barn. Norman told Castanza he doesn't drink. Castanza insists he won't have to. 
Once they get their food, Castanza orders 2 shots. Norman thinks nothing of it til Castanza tells the waitress on is for him and the other for Norman. Norman Shakes his head, but Castanza encourages him to loosen up. Telling Norman he need not worry. They take the shots then hit the road.

Back at Castanza's house Castanza thinks Norman and leaves Norman in his driveway. Norman stumbles over to his house. He enters and apologizes to Norman for coming home so late. He tells Norman how crazy he was tonight. "I let a drunk man drive me home!" He exclaimed. Then he searched WebMD to see how long the effects will last. Before he went to bed at 8 PM.

</thread><thread title=[Norman Cuts Himself] author=[piesology] text=[Norman would watch the sharp blade slice through skin after skin. It was a messy job, so he always cut in the kitchen. It was easier to clean up. His hands were covered in the strange smelling residue that leaked out of the sliced skin, the odor lingering for days. Norman made sure to apply hand lotion so no one could detect the scent. 

Each and every cut brought more tears to Norman's eyes. The tears occured as a natural reflex, unaccompanied by heaving sobs or cries, leaving him placidly composed. What if his cat were to discover him, or the phone were to ring? He'd had a lot of practise throughout his life, but it still made him sad nonetheless. 

After doing it two times that evening, Norman debated doing it again. He wiped his tear stained eyes with the back of his hand, nose wrinkling at the familiar yet intrusive smell. Yes, he decided, one more couldn't hurt. So Norman began the routine for the third time. Fresh tears pricked again. Nostrils flared at the smell again. Low feeling washed over him again.

"Ouch!" Norman dropped the knife and pulled his hand away quickly to stick his pointer finger in his mouth. The raw sweet and spicy taste from the onion covered his tongue. Norman glanced at the pile of diced brown onion before studying the wound on his finger. Harmless, but he didn't want his blood seeping into the dish he was preparing for dinner.

Norman run the cut under cold water before bandaging his finger. Norman wasn't very skilled with a knife, so he was bound to make a mistake. He resolved to be more careful when chopping onions from now on.

<comment number=[1]author=[Odrevan]text=[Personally, I don't know what to think about this story but I do know this story took time and effort to write properly. I think the obvious bait title has been a trope done to death in Norman stories, but to your credit this is one of the best executions of leading the reader off the scent in the actual story. It all ties perfectly back in when you know what it's about too, which is impressive. 

When trying to analyse the story past the gimmick of the switch and bait, I'm wondering why you picked the topic of self harm. I think it's a brave and suitable theme to have in a story here if done right, and I do think it is. It reminds me of a story done with the same gimmicky title a while back ago (link here -&gt; [click] (https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/3ykvsw/norman_considers_suicide/) ) that also had a subconscious theme of Norman committing self harm / suicide. Of course he doesn't, but the idea is always lingering in the background. Not everyone that's suffering from depression inflicts self harm or commits suicide, but I think it's fair to say it's in the back of the mind of a lot of depressed people, even if they don't fully know it.

A group of teenagers rushed past him laughing among themselves.  One of the girls bumped him and she turned back and saw Norman but didn't say anything.  Norman accepted this but it had been a long day and he thought about saying something but didn't see the point.  He shoved his hands in his pockets and felt a crumpled piece of paper.  He took it out expecting an old receipt but instead found a crumpled up $5 bill.  That made him happy and as he walked, smiling at the small bit of luck that had redeemed the day he saw a convenience store and figured he might as well see how far this luck would stretch.

Norman went inside the store and asked the clerk for a $5 scratch ticket.  He smiled and took the ticket home to scratch.  The whole walk home felt like the climb up a roller coaster so full of anticipation and possibilities.

Norman got home and put the ticket on the table while he prepared a small dinner.  After he ate he sat and used an old penny to scratch off the little treasure chests on the ticket.  He matched three numbers, $1 each.  He half smiled and half shrugged and stuffed the ticket in his jacket pocket.

*A blinding flash of light*

*A loud ringing in Norman's ears*

Norman looked over in a daze to where his sergeant was just seated, his lifeless body laying slumped into a fresh, smouldering crater. As he turned his head back, Norman thought he saw the body disappear, but his attention was drawn to the group of Germans now crossing the field in his direction.

Norman raised his rifle to eye level, steadied his breathing -as much as he could- and pressed the trigger... He missed. He steadied a bit more, resting the rifle on the edge of the foxhole, pressed the trigger again and... He missed again.

Then all at once, he was hit, he fell into the foxhole on his back. Norman felt as if his soul was leaving his body. He could see himself lying there, viewed from above. Norman noticed one of the enemy soldiers rushing into his foxhole, they seemed to sit directly on his face and he heard them say "Get wrecked faggot!"

Norman took off his headset and set the controller back on to the display stand in the store. "I guess Call of Duty isn't the game for me."

Norman walked to the door, and opened it to find his neighbor, Jennifer.  She looked rushed, and her two children, aged seven and nine, were running about in his front yard. Jennifer and her husband were in their late thirties, and had been good neighbors insofar as they had never intruded on Norman's privacy and generally kept it down in the evenings.


"Norman!" She began, speaking quickly. "The car won't start and I've got to get a tow to the garage.  I can't take the kids and my sister is out of town.  I wouldn't normally ask, but..."


Jennifer trailed off, leaving an open ended statement that was almost a request.  Norman looked at her, puzzled.  "But?" he questioned.


"But..." she continued, "would you mind watching Julie and Kevin for a couple of hours?  I'll be back as soon as I can."


Norman wanted to say no, as he had never been good with kids and was looking forward to some solitude after a particularly stressful week at the office.  But then he recalled his mother's wisdom that a good person never left a neighbor stranded.  "I... I suppose that would be all right, provided-" he began.


"Oh, THANK you Norman!" Jennifer interrupted him, then called to the two kids.  They tramped through the flowers at the bottom of the step, charged onto the small porch, then ran past norman and into the house without taking off their shoes.  He looked on, aghast.  Jennifer was already making her way across the driveway to where a tow truck had just stopped in front of her house.  She gave him a wave before going to tend to her faulty vehicle.


From inside his house, he heard the two children giggling and running about.  Something fell to the floor and the cat let out a yell.  Norman sighed and rubbed his temples.  This was going to be a long morning.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/56wiow/norman_babysits/] createDate=[1476191235] score=[3] numComments=[0]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Picks His Nephew Up From School] author=[ligamentary] text=[It was a thick, humid day in the Northwest. Norman crept down the suburban side street at the school zone mandated 15 miles per hour. He looked left and right for a parking lot, but saw none. He did notice a spot in the pharmacy parking lot, but it was marked "For customer use only" and Norman didn't want to set a bad example for his nephew by flouting the laws of the lot. 

Checking to be sure the roadway was safe and clear, he pulled off to ask a crossing guard in a mesh orange vest with neon yellow safety tape, for assistance. She explained the parking lot was back the way he'd came, and he'd need to circle the block and look for a green sign that read "OSCA PARKING". Norman was quick to the task and soon stood in front of the towering concrete fortress that housed his nephew's school, O. Stanton Chalmers Academy. It was a passable charter school, known more for the quality of the facilities than the academics. 

Norman saw a surly older woman with a purple cardigan, who appeared to be checking names off a list. She held a whistle between her teeth, in anticipation of the inevitable need to blow it. 

Norman tapped her on the shoulder when an audible greeting failed to catch her attention. She raised her eyebrows, urging him to speak, but didn't acknowledge him beyond that. "Excuse me, M'am, I'm looking for my nephew Norman--" "What grade is he?" The woman asked, returning her attention to the clipboard list. "I believe the 5th grade as he's just turned eleven years old, but I'm not sure. I could call--" "5th grade, to the left of the auditorium and in the back. 

Norman loped down the narrow passageway between lumpy teachers and lanky pre-teens. "Uncle Norman!" Norman heard a voice call out. "Norman my boy!" Norman exclaimed with joy as he wrapped his arms around young Norman. When they began the walk back to the car, Norman remarked, "It was quite an adventure finding you, kid!" "Really Uncle Norman? Tell me *everything*! Your life is so cool, it could be its own subreddit." ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/55m86r/norman_picks_his_nephew_up_from_school/] createDate=[1475500227] score=[3] numComments=[1]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Replaces His TV Remote] author=[ligamentary] text=[Norman settled down on the couch after the final day of a relaxing long weekend. He'd just played a energetic round of tennis with his neighbor whom he didn't intend to keep in touch with should he ever move away. 

"I better fix dinner before I get comfortable." Norman decided, heaving himself up to a standing position. He opened his refrigerator and stood back. "Nothing to eat in here. It's too full." He closed the door and thought a moment. He wondered in his head "Do I want a whole meal or would a well choreographed snack be sufficient? I guess I did have an early lunch." Norman opened his freezer and found two perfectly good options. Half a box of fish sticks or a frozen pizza with pesto and sun-dried tomatoes. He settled on the fish sticks, since they were open. He read the directions and turned the knob to preheat his oven for the specified 325 degrees Fahrenheit. 

Norman returned to his favorite spot in the couch, where he'd left a "comfort" indentation, to wait for the oven to warm. Just as he was about to sit, it occurred to him, he'd been out of town last weekend. So the fish sticks may be older than he originally expected. He checked the expiration date, and sure enough, they'd turned two days prior. He put his textured slippers on and tossed the box in the outside trash so they wouldn't emanate a fishy odor in thawing in the kitchen trash. He returned and went about putting the pizza in the oven. Fortunately the pizza was also to be cooked at 325 degrees, so no further manipulation of the oven was required. 

Finally situated on the couch, he flipped the TV on to channel 12 ice hockey. Or at least, he tried to. The remote wouldn't turn on the television. He tried aiming it at different spots of the TV. He took his cable box out of the cabinet so it was visible to the remote. When that didn't work he finally, begrudgingly, went to the supply drawer at the other end of the room to find a D battery and screwdriver with which to change it. 

He made a note on his pad to buy more D batteries as he returned to the couch. But the battery change was futile. "I'm sure I still have that warranty card somewhere." Norman thought as he gritted his teeth. After searching through old receipts he recovered the manual and purchase agreement which held the warranty code. He located the 1-800 number on his cable box and went through the touch tone menu, then was placed on a brief hold. They played a pleasant mix of muzak and light rock whilst he waited. 

When an operator came on, he described the issue and the steps he'd taken to troubleshoot it. The operator, who claimed his name was "Pat" but was definitely born with a name closer to "Indrajit", was mild mannered but efficient. He asked Norman for his zip code, which he provided. He was then placed on another hold to the tune of a pop song which he cared for less than the previous selection. 

Pat returned a minute later. "Norman, I am pleased to inform you that EveryTown cable will be able to replace your remote at no extra charge as you are within your warranty expiry date. You can have it shipped to you or you may pick it up at any of our partner stores such as Best Buy or Radio Shack. In the meantime you will find all the regular remote functions are accessible through manual buttons on your cable box. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you, and would like to credit your account $25 to be put towards your next cable bill." Norman thanked them for their assistance and arranged to have the new remote shipped to him. He declined expedited shipping as he was going out of town again soon, and wanted to be home to receive the package. 

He hung up the phone and, using a hot pad, removed his pizza from the oven. Transferring it to a plate he sat down to watch his ice hockey game. The pizza was a bit undercooked but Norman had already turned off the oven and decided it was fine as it was. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/55gyox/norman_replaces_his_tv_remote/] createDate=[1475413536] score=[4] numComments=[0]>

</thread><thread title=[Life of Yeng: Norman's Surprise Part 2] author=[DukeofDandelion] text=[Norman eventually resolved that no matter which of his theories proved to be true, it would be best just to go to work and finish his normal Tuesday as if he was still wearing his own face. He covered all of his apartment’s mirrors, finished his toiletries, grabbed his computer bag, locked the door, descended the stairs and kept his eyes low to the floor, lifting them only high enough to avoid whatever was ahead. When he reached the bus stop, he asked one of the men waiting when the next bus was due to arrive. 

“Should be about ten minutes” Norman heard. “Oh thank goodness…” He warmed his hands in his pockets and began breathing easy. He was hopeful that the ride to work would calm his mind. He was even hopeful that he could just forget the morning’s drama: that he would walk into work, spot his reflection in a window (or perhaps glance up at the bathroom mirror) and be restored the face of the Norman he grew up with.

“Michael? Michael Yeng!” A woman was shouting some ways away from Norman. He paid as little attention to it as he did the passing cars, the chirping pigeons, or the still, silent people around him. That is, until the woman began tugging at his arm

“Michael? Is that you?” Norm’s face paled over as his fears seemed to manifest in front of him, in the form of this tall, irritable woman asking a name he had no recollection of.

“You know you’re late for work don’t you?”

Norman could only compose himself enough to shake his head. Still, she pressed:

“You were supposed to clock in like, three hours ago Mike.”

“Well…yea, but this isn-“

“You’re lucky I found you.” She began walking with his arm folded firmly into hers, dragging him along the way a nun might perhaps drag a child. And like that child, Norman felt completely powerless to stop her taking him; at once doing both his best to pry away and remain concealed from any onlookers, less they too see his morphed mug and mistake him for that stranger Michael Yeng.

She was doing her best to keep him moving. They had crossed the street and were heading toward “Double Buns and Burgers” restaurant. Norman began considering the possibility that perhaps Mike hijacked his life on purpose, perhaps to get away from this pushy, fair-faced table-jockey kidnapping him. The woman reached for the door and helped push Norman inside.

“Ok Mike, l’ll tell Jessup your bus caught a flat on the way, that I caught you walking to work. Here’s an apron-you can thank me later honey”

She went to the backroom. Meanwhile, Norman just stood blankly, clutching at his apron. He gazed over the food-counter, over the stoves and the dining area. His eyes fixed, unblinking, watching each employee in action: the cashier assisting customers, the cooks grilling burgers and chopping vegetables, the janitor pulling a mop and bucket into the bathroom; each and every one wearing that fat, eggshell-colored countenance that he had so carefully studied just after this morning’s concussion. All of them, save not one, wearing the same face as if it were part of their uniform. All wearing the mask of Michael Yeng.

</thread><thread title=[Norman shoots himself] author=[[deleted]] text=[Norman decided to run some errands. Norman walked to the store and started to feel parched. When passing by the dollar store, he thought to himself "Hmm, they'd probably have beverages a bit cheaper than the convenience store near by", and decided to stop in. 

Norman grabbed a diet soda, because he didn't want the extra calories. While at the check-out, Norman saw a selfie stick with a big green tag saying 'only $1!'. Norman thought to himself, "how novel! And quite a bargain.". He decided to put the selfie stick in his almost empty basket and then paid for his purchase. 

Norman left the store chuckling to himself about all the picture ideas he would take with Norman. Norman was so excited, that upon leaving the store be removed his new contraption from the bag, attached his phone, held it out, and snapped a shot. 

Norman took a look at the photo, and decided he didn't like it. He deleted the photo and promised to himself that his pictures with Norman would be much more photogenic. 

When Norman got home, he realized he forgot to do the errands he had set out to do, but decided to stay at home as he had enough adventures for one day.

</thread><thread title=[Norman takes a bath.] author=[TheQueenofLimbs_] text=[He liked to count how long he could hold his breath underwater. 


*One second, two second, ten seconds... thirty....*

He never seemed to be able to make it past one minute and thirteen seconds exactly before his head broke the surface of the water, mouth gasping for air. One minute and thirteen seconds could be an eternity, he'd learned.

After he'd gulped as much as his lungs could manage he stared at himself there in the water. The pudgy skin around his waistline was red and prickled from the scalding water. Thick mounds of black hair unevenly patterned his thick legs all the way down to ankle-less size thirteen wide feet bulging out the water. He shifted himself within the tub, as if this would change the body he saw before himself.


*No wonder she left..* He thought wearily.


He did not hate himself. He did not want anyone to think he did, and this is very important. He did not want to kill himself. 

He simply *didn't wish to exist anymore*; to absolve himself from the world and from those he loved. Norman was not a person, but a casket. Empty and inanimate.. simply waiting for the body to be motionless. 

He didn't want to die, he supposed. There was a kind of courage in suicide, not that he condoned it of course. But to push yourself beyond the realm of humanity.. to breach a barrier that no one has ever returned from... This took both a strength and sorrow that he did not posses. This is why he pulled himself back under the water, and waited.


*One second, two second... one minute and thirteen seconds.*


Two arms gripping the sides of the porcelain lugged his hefty body out the water and forced him to swallow the humid air surrounding him. He liked to push himself to see how far he could go.. to breach the barrier of comfort and mundane...
Underwater he could not feel pain, or the emptiness that lingered within him. He longed to push past the survival instinct to breathe in, and feel the numbness of content. He could never do it. He couldn't even do that right.


*No wonder she left....*



He couldn't stand to think about her. Losing her. Missing her. Knowing she was better without him.

This was as close to killing himself as he could imagine.

He should be happy for her.. that she's happy. She says she isn't, not truly, because he's still a wreck.. But deep down he knows she is better off. He was hollow.. There was no *Norman* to love. He rarely felt anything at all beyond a nagging emptiness inside his bones. In all the years of his life, the only thing that came close to filling it was her. He used her for it.. Filling himself of her and everything she gave him, then selfishly discarding her because he knew he couldn't do the same for her. Not because he didn't love her, but the constant aching inside of him left him constantly trying to appease his own consciousness, and this left very little time for her.
She cried a lot. This made him sad, but a disconnected faucet cannot leak. So he yelled at her.


*Why was* **she** *crying? Couldn't she see how this was making* **him** *feel?*


There were no words inside of him.. Only thoughts. It might have well been a different language, because she only stared at him for an explanation while he muttered under his breath. He was a jack-o-lantern.. A smile carved unto his face, while the core of him was melting.


*Stupid* He sighed.

But there was no going back.
She's found someone now.


He didn't want to think about it.

*One.... two..... one minute and nineteen seconds...*



He gasped.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4mljkf/norman_takes_a_bath/] createDate=[1465122885] score=[3] numComments=[6]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman beats his meat.] author=[DriedUpSquid] text=[After a long day at work, Norman stopped off at the supermarket to pick up dinner.  Usually, he would just have leftovers, but he was going on his third day of chicken and it was starting to be less appetizing with each passing day.  He needed something different, but what?

Slowly he wandered up and down the aisles, looking for anything that might strike his fancy.  Frozen dinner?  A sandwich from the deli?  Nothing was really sticking out.  He took out his kerchief and wiped the sweat from his brow.  It had been very warm lately and he had parked so far away that he built up a sweat on the way into the store.  Hot weather always reminded Norman of his love for BBQ.  "That's it" he thought, "I'll grill up a juicy steak for dinner!"

Norman hurriedly shuffled to the meat department, eager to peruse the fine selections.  A delicious looking T-Bone caught his eye.  It was his favorite cut, and this one had beautiful marbling.  Alas, a look at the price tag reminded Norman that he was on a tight budget.  Eventually Norman arrived at the end of the display, where the discounted meats were sold.  He found a New York Strip that was 50% off.  Upon closer inspection, the steak was getting close to the end of its shelf life, and what was once a bright red steak was now gray in spots, and had a silvery sheen when held at an angle.  It was still good, and would fit Norman's needs.

Upon arriving at home, Norman cleared the spiderwebs from his trusty charcoal grill (an old Weber he found on Spring Clean Out Day in his old neighborhood).  A quick scrub on the rusty grate with a well-worn steel brush, a fair amount of lighter fluid on the store brand charcoal briquettes, and soon blue smoke poured forth.

While the coals were getting hot, Norman prepared his steak.  He had already poked holes in his potato, and it was slowly turning in the microwave.  He cut the Saran Wrap and drained the blood into his sink.  There was a little bit of slime, but a good scrubbing under cold water helped that.  

Now that it was clean, Norman could see that there wasn't as much marbling as he liked.  Reaching into a drawer, Norman pulled out his meat tenderizer, the spiked hammer he had found at the church rummage sale 3 years ago.  Covering the steak with foil, Norman began to beat his meat furiously, breaking down the connective tissue.   A dash of salt and pepper (from the shakers you see at picnics with cobs of corn printed on the side), and the steak was ready to cook.  

Placing the tenderized steak on the searing hot grill, Norman took pleasure in hearing the sizzle.  Summer was almost here, and he looked forward to sunny days ahead.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4gsmix/norman_beats_his_meat/] createDate=[1461850649] score=[5] numComments=[13]>

A bag over his head in the morning, a swift kick to the back of the knee, and now Norman had his head placed rather uncomfortably on a chopping block. *This Mondæg is off to a terrible start,* thought Norman.

"Here be Norman the Oaf!" shouted the Yeoman, standing above Norman with his foot placed proudly on his back. "This man allowed a dozen poachers into our most prized herd, and slaughtered them all! Norman is a traitor that deserves death!"

From afar, Cnut gave one simple, subtle nod. The headsman's axe came out.

Norman knew he wasn't a traitor. Last night he encounter a wild cat, one that had a litter of kittens trailing behind. Norman followed them into the woods, to give the felines leftover fish from last moon's raid. The mother cat wasn't kind to Norman, and quickly slipped into the night after taking the fish head with it. The cats weren't the only thing to escape from Norman that night.

He walked in, grabbed a cart, and began checking off the various things off his list. Cat food, toilet paper (better get the good stuff this time, he decides). Frozen pizza. He ponders the ice cream. Reaches for rocky road, but has a change of heart and picks vanilla instead. Eggs, Bananas, potatoes, oatmeal. He pauses at the cold case with the salad mix.

'Hmm...' 

His eyes narrow

'Better...save money,' and he continues salad-less. 

A few other people are walking through the store. A homeless looking man, with a dirty red beanie and a matching coat. Construction workers buying breakfast food in the deli. People like him, there to avoid the crowds. 

Norman admires the yet-unscuffed wax on the tile floor, the way the ghosts of the long cold florescents shimmer as his heels click to the soft jazz coming quietly through.

At last, he comes to aisle 12, home to the last item on the slightly crumpled paper. The humble spatula. He had decided recently he needed a change in his life, and what better than to treat himself to a new metal spatula.

No more would his pancake scrunch and fold under the old worn plastic. No more would his eggs yolks break.
From the shelf he hefted his chosen tool. 16 gauge steel, rivets. Flat and mean. Hard black plastic handle, black and heavy as the Soul of Satan.
He wields the spatula, rolls his wrists as he flips innumerable imaginary pancakes, omelettes, and burgers; He sautes and sashays.

'This will be mine,' he vows as he holds it up to catch the light.

'And I will call her...*Martha*

</thread><thread title=[Norman Has a Nosebleed] author=[lumpyspacejams] text=[It was ragweed season, and very dry as well. Typically, there would be more rain to dry out the pollen, but the heat wave this past summer made everything uncomfortably arid. 

&amp;nbsp;

Norman woke up at his usual time on Sunday morning. He got up, going over his plans to go to a Sunday matinee documentary about cows, and to go to a close by pizza place for plain cheese pizza. As he went to the bathroom, Norman's face felt wet and sticky, and he could smell iron. 

&amp;nbsp;

He looked into the mirror, yelping slightly at the sight. 

&amp;nbsp;

Down his pajama shirt and all over his face was blood. It was a small amount, speckles of dried blood and a smear along his upper lip and nostrils, but it was more blood than he would have cared for. 

&amp;nbsp;

Grabbing some tissues, Norman tried to wipe the blood away, but it was still coming from his nose. "Oh dear." He said, "I must have a nose bleed." 

&amp;nbsp;

After washing his face and brushing his teeth, Norman jammed small amounts of tissue into his nostrils. He went to the kitchen, picking up a small sauce pan and filling it with a few cups of water and a little bit of cinnamon, before putting it to boil. This would help add humidity to the air, and help with the nose bleed, he thought. 

&amp;nbsp;

If he could not get the nose bleed down, he would have to go to the urgency care office and get a prescription. But he would miss his movie and pizza, so instead he stood by the stove and hoped the bleeding would stop. 

&amp;nbsp;

Norman checked the tissues, noticing less blood. He dabbed at his face with a napkin carefully, before deciding it was done. While his nose was slightly clogged and still felt dry, the bleeding stopped and it felt more comfortable. Satisfied with the result, Norman shut off the stove top and moved the pot of boiling water away from the hot burner. Water and cinnamon were good for occasional humidity, but he thought cinnamon was too spicy for normal use.

&amp;nbsp;

Norman changed into a nice shirt and pants, and went out to his movie and pizza. He also stopping by a local pharmacy on the way home to pick up a bottle of saline solution and a humidifier. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/55si6i/norman_has_a_nosebleed/] createDate=[1475597657] score=[3] numComments=[0]>

He spent a few minutes wiping his sweaty palms down the front of his shirt at the prospect of having to endure the torment of young kids jeering at him in line at the burger joint 5 minutes down the street, and decided that no, he would take his car and use their drive-through.

Norman got into his car and turned on the ignition. Instantly the smell of grease wafted up to his nose, reminding him that he had felt lousy the evening before and had done the exact same thing as he was going to do. He sighed as he drove past the burger joint; after all, he did not want the staff there to think he had burgers everyday for dinner.

30 minutes later, Norman was back home with Norman on his lap, watching a wild-life documentary and sharing his fries with Norman.

</thread><thread title=[A Series That is Norman: Man of Misfortune] author=[giantofgiants] text=[(Part 1)

By far the most lovely thing about Vista Overlook was its location. Resting on top of the tallest hill, its residents saw the long and narrow valley below, and far off in the distance, on the other side of the valley, were tall mountain peaks whose high tips were touched by snow of the purest white. It was a rather large neighborhood, and beautiful, nearing 2000 acres of land with some of the most opulent houses money could buy. Most of them were two stories in height, with complementing colors and intricate details and boasting large and pretty gardens cultivated by masterful gardeners. There were grand exceptions though; one in particular was the house that belonged to Doctor Eugen. To call it a mere house would be a misidentification. Truly it was a mansion that towered four stories tall and was surrounded by a proper field with a hedge maze, olympic sized swimming pool, game court, and garden. A big garden. Every day Doctor Eugen would get in his black Phantom Rolls Royce and drive to work. There was a smooth, dark road with many twists and turns that wound its way through Vista Overlook and this was the road Doctor Eugen would take to exit the neighborhood. On his way out, however, the sight of Doctor Eugen would meet the hideous appearance of a rather out-of-place dwelling on the edge of Vista Overlook. This one house was the only poor exception to the great material prosperity of the other residents of Vista Overlook. The home in consideration was only one story tall and much of it was falling apart. In fact, to a keen observer, the whole plot of land was askew, tilting away from the much nicer homes. Doctor Eugen saw this one bad mark on an otherwise pristine habitation and this filled him with disgust and contempt.

This was where Norman lived.

As Doctor Eugen approached the home of Norman in his black Rolls Royce, he saw a lonely man in his dirty bath robes standing before it in the driveway. This man was bald with a wrinkled face, in his early forties, and leaned slightly to his right on account of the arthritis in his left foot. In his right hand he was holding a mug of black coffee and in his left arm he was holding a pretty little white cat. 

This was Norman. Doctor Eugen hated Norman. 

Norman and his cat, also called Norman, knew how much Doctor Eugen hated him, yet this did not stop Norman from waving at Doctor Eugen like any good neighbor would do. However, at the sight of this friendly gesture, Doctor Eugen became angry and firmly pressed down on the gas pedal of his black Rolls Royce and its tires lost their grip on the ground and promptly "burned rubber". This rather hurt Norman's feelings. He thought: "Why does he hate me as such? I have always been a good neighbor to him! Since I've been living here, always waving at him or saying 'How do you do?' when he leaves for work. This will not bother me today, oh no. Today is going to be a good day! I can just feel it!"

And on that thought, Norman, with his cat and cup of coffee, went inside his unimpressive abode to finish getting ready for the day's work ahead of him.

</thread><thread title=[Norman rides the bus] author=[ViciousPug] text=[Norman takes the bus to work four days a week. He would take the bus every day, but he prefers to stop for groceries on the way home on Wednesdays. Norman figured it out once, and his bus ride saves him approximately $2.80 a week in gas money, which he spends instead on a small bag of liver treats for Norman. Norman seems to approve of Norman's frugality.

This afternoon, promptly at 5:00, Norman saved his work and shut down his computer. He gathered up his light brown jacket and his dark brown bag and walked to the elevator.

Today, the number 12 bus was right on time, and it wasn't too crowded so Norman could get his favorite seat. It's the third seat back, on the right side of the bus. He put his light brown jacket and his dark brown bag on his lap and settled in for the ride.

On the bus, Norman looked around, careful not to stare too long at anyone. He was amazed, as he always was, by the number of people who spend the whole ride staring at their phones. He thought about watching a video on his phone, like the woman in front of him, but that might make him carsick. Or bus-sick? Norman spent a few moments wondering whether that was a word or not.

At the next stop, three young women from the local college swarmed on, talking animatedly about what they were going to cook for dinner that night. One suggested pasta with pesto, and Norman thought that sounded pretty good, but he had already planned to have hot dogs, so he stopped listening and thought about hot dogs instead.

Outside, the weather was sunny. Norman doesn't mind when it rains, though. If it rains, he looks out the window and watches the raindrops race down the glass. Or he looks out the front and watches the windshield wipers. There's always something to see on the number 12.

After 22 minutes, the bus stopped in Norman's neighborhood. Norman exited the bus, thanking the driver, as he does every time. The driver grunted in acknowledgement. Norman walked the two blocks to his home, and let himself in the door. Norman rubbed up against his ankles in greeting and Norman smiled down at him. "A new bag of liver treats tomorrow, Norman," he said, as he pulled a package of hot dogs out of the refrigerator.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/54249x/norman_rides_the_bus/] createDate=[1474619124] score=[2] numComments=[0]>

It was the only question in Norman's head, and even though it was but a single word, it was daunting, very daunting indeed.

"Let's think this over from the start", Norman thought to himself.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

Two weeks ago, Lisa had come up to him all excited. She had said, "You know how it's my birthday in two weeks, right?" - "Right", Norman had said, trying to sound confident. He hadn't known before she had told him. He knew now, so it wasn't technically a lie.

"So I'm thinking, right?", Lisa continued, "Well maybe, probably, but not sure yet! But maybe I want to... throw a party!?"

"A party?", Norman asked, a bit confused.

"Yeah!", Lisa said, her hopeful eyes fixed on his. "Why?", Norman asked. There it was, the first occurrence of the dreaded question. Her answer was simple enough. 

"For my birthday Norman!"

"I understand that you like to celebrate your birthday", Norman explained himself, "I just don't understand why you would go through all the trouble of a party. Your whole house will be a mess afterwards, and all those people around..." Norman shivered somewhere deep inside.

"Do you not want to come, Norman?", Lisa asked, and he could hear the disappointment in her voice.

"Okay, I'll be there. Just let me know the time and place", Norman said, turned around and started walking towards the toilet. "I'll send a group email about it!", Lisa called after him. "Bye!", he heard, before he shut the toilet door. Was it a coincidence that it rhymed with "Why?"

</thread><thread title=[Norman accidentally joins a year long gym membership.] author=[Gloriousstudent] text=[A familiar breeze whooshed through Norman's window as he was slowly waking from a late afternoon nap. As he woke, Norman noticed that Norman was sleeping calmly beside him on his recliner. "I should really start Norman's new diet" he thought to himself. The vet had recently set up a new food plan for Norman which included consuming less calories from a vet-based canned cat food. Reflecting on Norman's own health, he decided that going to the gym and trying to become more fit himself would be a good thing for his cat, Norman, to see. "I must try and be the best Norman I can be", he said to himself proudly. 

The next day, Norman woke up at a reasonable time, ate his oatmeal and berries, and travelled to the gym which was shy of 15 minutes away. Norman sat in the car and looked at his watch. "2:35 is a perfectly good time to visit the gym" he said to himself. He strolled across the parking lot and entered the gym. The unfamiliar music was a bit too loud for his taste, but he tried to tune it out as he steadily walked to the front desk. 

Norman was second in line, behind a young, fit woman who was renewing her gym membership. "That will be $450 even please, ma'am" said the man at the desk. Norman was suddenly beside himself. "Can I afford $450?" Norman thought to himself. 

The woman ahead of him flashed a smile at Norman, and left into the depths of the unfamiliar Gymnasium. "How can I help you today, Sir?" Said the man. Norman thought, and thought hard as he hadn't done his research about pricing. "I will take a 6 month membership, please." 

The man at the desk looked friendly with bright blue eyes.His eyes shifted to the computer in front of him and he started to type. "I will need you to fill out this form" Said the man. "Please sign here, here, and...here". He appeared as though he was a regular himself and Norman felt uneasy, maybe even jealous. "I'm sorry sir," Norman added "I actually meant that I would take the full year membership". "Excellent!" Said the man. "That will come to $900". 

At this point, Norman started to sweat. He knew that he couldn't turn down the membership he asked for, or he would look like a fool. "Thank you", Norman said as he flashed his Visa.

Norman decided to skip the gym that day, as he figured he would need a few hours to learn about the equipment, and the gym closed at 5. "There's always tomorrow" Norman said to himself as he walked to the car, anticipating Norman's me-ow upon his return. "Today was a good day".

Although Norman has a Facebook profile, he avoided putting up his date of birth. The reasons were twofold. 
1) He was above the notion of sharing one's moments publicly on a social platform with a bunch of strangers. 
2) To prevent the embarrassment of no one wishing him on his timeline. Not that this lack of "friends" bothered him in the least. But you know, he was already considered a queer fellow by the "normal" people and Norman didn't want to supplement that notion with the image of a lonely man in his fifties who had no friends(both online and offline ) to wish him on his birthday. 

Here was Norman who was content with sharing a slice of cake with his loyal cat and the belief that there were some people who enjoyed reading about his little moments on Reddit.

“I’m doing quite well, Jonathan.  And yourself?”  She asked this while rolling her shoulders back, pushing her chest out slightly. 

The smile on Jonathan’s face widened. “I’m doing great, thank you for asking. I came here to ask about your husband. The late nights you’ve been working lately, is that because of him?” Jonathan knew his boldness might be his undoing, but he grew weary of the subtlety he has had to apply these recent weeks. His internship was almost up, and he decided now was his chance. 

“You’ve noticed have you? Yes, Norman has been difficult lately. Also Norman junior is failing college and wants to move to Hollywood to become an actor. I just wish I had someone I could speak to about all of this, I have plenty I need to get off my chest.”

Jonathan knew that this was his moment to shine. “Oh goodness, I’m so sorry to hear about that. If there is anything I can do to help you, please let me know. And I mean anything.” Jonathan put his hand on her knee. 

Felecia smiled. 


Norman sat in his chair with Norman on his lap. He held a letter in his hand. Silently Norman wept as he finished reading the letter. Norman Junior had just packed up his bags and left for Hollywood and his wife left a letter for him explaining her new boyfriend and how young and beautiful he was, and how Norman was not. 

“At least one thing in my life won’t leave me.” Norman said as he pet Norman’s back. Norman purred.

His neighbours were on their balconies watering plants, milling around in the courtyard or going about their daily business - doing who knows what. Caught in a moment of absent-mindedness Norman would often let his mind wander - this time to a work function he had attended. It was an Oktoberfest themed do and everyone he got on well with at work were going, a pang of angst and regret swept through Normal, causing him to shift in his seat - unsettling Norman who was dozing on his lap. How he wished he hadn't gotten so drunk, how rude he was to his colleague's fiance.
The moment passed and he began stroking Norman again, this soothed those embarrassing memories and he began staring out the window again, caught in the half day dream. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/55h97e/normal_regretted_getting_too_drunk/] createDate=[1475420237] score=[1] numComments=[2]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman gets a tooth pulled.] author=[sniggity] text=[Another day for Norman as he sits at his desk eating his Misua noodles with mung beans. Norman is eating while daydreaming about going fishing again with the rod Helen bought for him when Norman yells, "OUCH....OW....OOOOOO....MY TOOTH !" Norman takes something out of his mouth and sees that he bit into an uncooked mung bean ! He asks his boss if he can leave early for an emergency dental appointment due to his tooth giving him severe and chronic pain. "Sure, Norman, I hope you're alright, take a couple days if you need it", exclaims his boss. 

Norman walks into the dental office nervous as can be and signs in and then grabs a Sports Illustrated and takes a seat. About a half hour goes by as Norman gets called back. Norman waits another 15 minutes and finally the Dentist walks in and asks him the problem. Norman explains he bit into an uncooked mung bean. The doctor, at first thought Norman was teasing him due to the doctor being Chinese and all. But after more explaining the doctor realizes Norman is serious and begins to explain he can pay $2700 to save the tooth or pay $80 to just have it pulled. Norman decides on the latter. "Frugality is a curse sometimes," says Norman. The doctor says, "ok, lay back, we are going to give you a little lidocaine and then  some nitrous."  Norman starts inhaling the nitrous nice and slow, all of a sudden he starts to hear a fast ringing in his ears that sounds like, wawawawawawawawwawa and as he starts to relax he gives the doctor a big smile. The next thing he knows the nurse is saying, "good morning sleepyhead, you did great !"  The nurse tells Norman, "once you feel like you can stand up, just make your way to the front desk for your follow up appointment and you'll be on your way."  Norman thanks the young lady as he tries to keep the gauze from falling out and makes his appointment and leaves. "That was nothing to be nervous about" he says as he looks for his keys. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/54rhdh/norman_gets_a_tooth_pulled/] createDate=[1475023470] score=[3] numComments=[2]>

Meetings had taken up his morning, lunch, and most of the afternoon. Now in front of him was a complex problem, and coming through his desk speakers, at a volume no one else would be bothered by, was a podcast about the horrors of trench warfare. Norman was deep into his personal groove. Just as the rats were eating the dead bodies, a woman he worked with appeared in his peripheral vision and a song began to play. It was music box dancer. He turned his head to see the woman holding a musical greeting card, her body tilted forward ten degrees and smiling weakly, as if to say "How impossibly adorable is this, well, my entire body wilts at its cuteness, see?"

Norman paused his show of blood, looked up and said "There is nothing more innocent than the heart of a child. Is that what you want me to say? Are we good here?"

</thread><thread title=[Norman gets stranded.] author=[BlackDS] text=[Norman was feeling a bit adventurous, so after work he decided that he would go out and enjoy the fresh summer weather. He sat anxiously in front of his work computer, thinking of his favorite summer activity: driving around through the state park near his house. Maybe, if everything is okay, he will go on the long road that goes around the lake. He will have to see when he gets there. 

5 O'clock rolled around, Norman grabbed his empty lunch box, and walked out the door with a sort of unfamiliar swagger knowing about all of the fun he was about to have. He entered his brown 1987 Yugo GV, and turned the key like he had done hundreds of times before. As he set off, he began to recall the day he bought the car. The dealer offered him upmodel GV for less than the base model. It even had an automatic transmission! Norman had named the car Yogi, because it looked like a little cub. 

Norman cruised around the serene landscape of the state park, gripping the thin, plastic steering wheel. "Today is a good day" Norman thought to himself as he turned on his AM radio to his favorite broadcast: WQ22, talk radio. 

All of a sudden, Yogi started sputtering, and Norman pulled over. Smoke started spewing from the hood. "I don't understand, I've gotten all of the maintenance done" he said out loud. After calling AAA for a tow, he gently closed his driver door in frustration. The next day, the mechanic called him and said that he engine block cracked, and the car would never run again. 

"I never should have taken the long road along the lake" Norman thought.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4mne3z/norman_gets_stranded/] createDate=[1465162215] score=[0] numComments=[1]>

This confuses Norman very much. He thinks to himself, "Well I better get my glasses cuz I can't see anything right now." He walks into his bedroom and grabs his glasses from the bedside table that also supports a very old framed picture of Norman and his wife gazing happily into each other's eyes and returns to his four-legged amigo in the bathroom. Norman instantly sees, with his newly acquired vision, that his cat is not actually a he but a shockingly similar she. "Oh no," Norman thought to himself in a panic, "where is Norman? And who are you?" Norman then calms himself down extravagantly with a single thought, "Eh, Norman always ends up coming back around. He's a true friend." As he gazes at the stranger laying in his tub with a big kitty smile on her face, he smiles back and says, "Well at least you'll be clean today."] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4fhf20/norman_gives_norman_a_bath/] createDate=[1461099221] score=[1] numComments=[1]>

Norman meowed at Norman's feet. "I'm so sorry," said Norman, "You are great company, but tonight I need to kick you out." Norman gentle coaxed Norman out the door and gently shit it behind him. 

Then he began to get ready. All of the couch pillows were fluffed and arranged properly, all furniture properly arranged, he was ready. The last step was to close the blinds and darken the room.

The clock showed 6:51 PM. Perfect, thought Norman, I am just in time. But as the clock neared closer to seven, he began to have second thoughts. Was he ready for this?

But all thoughts were erased as he switched on the TV at 6:57 just to see the announcement: "don't miss after the break- the CSI season finale."

The episode was very satisfying. Afterwards, Norman set about the task of returning the living room to normal. As he went to pull up the blinds, however, they caught on something and snapped a little. Norman frowned. He would have to call a repairman for that.

He scratched his bald head, and said, "Hmm... Where to go... where to go..." He was feeling slightly thirsty. "I will go to the lake! No... let's just go to the bar."

Norman hopped into his car and drove to the bar.

"So, what'll it be," the bartender asked.

"Gimme your strongest beer, bartender!' Norman replied.

"Sure thing," the bartender passed Norman a jug of Spirytus Polish Vodka.

Norman chugged the vodka straight out of the jug, fearing of alcohol poisoning. The world went black.

He awoke to find himself on his kitchen floor. *I wasn't here before, was I*? He noticed his car when he got up. It was firmly lodged between his fridge and the roof, a massive hole in the wall behind it. 

"MY CAR!!" Norman cried. "What happened my sweet?"

Norman dialed the bartender, wanting to know what happened. 

"Well, first some fool dared you to drink out of a toilet. You decided to one-up that, drove home, brought back your cat, and drank his pee!"

Norman *did* have an odd taste in his mouth. 

"Then the police came banging on the door, said it was a drug bust! They searched your car and found ten pounds of cinnamon!" 

His car was coated in the foul seasoning.

"You drove off and that was the last we heard of you."

As he shoved a waffle down his throat and walked out of the house, Norman escaped. In his panic, Norman started running after Norman and the waffle fell of his mouth.

As he ran out of the building, Norman hurried down the street to see the young baker he was attracted to for a long time in his regular bakery. 
The baker was busy cleaning the store windows so Norman didn't want to bother her, but he realized Norman's life is in danger so he has no choice but to interrupt her.

Gathering the courage to approach the worker, she saw him and smiled.
Norman figured she will be intimated by him trying to talk to her all sweaty and short of breath. After contemplating what to do next for a few second that felt much longer, he eventually walked in and asked if she saw a fat cat running down the street? The baker laughed at the description and said she did not but will be happy to assist Norman in finding his cat. Norman said it will not be necessary thank you, and walked out only to hear a distinct sound of meow from behind the bakery.

They'd gotten mixed up a while back and were in an oak forest trying to get their bearings. As they searched a map the Radisson has provided...

A CLOWN JUMPED OUT FROM THE SHADOWS. 

Norman's coworkers screamed and lunged back, but Norman just looked 'round, quite confused. "Where are you going? It's just a circus clown." Norman scratched his chin "Is there a circus near here? What are you doing in the woods so late?" The clown produced a knife from his puffy costume and Norman's jaw dropped. 

"That's quite dangerous. Off with this mask, come on." Norman reached forward and peeled off the mask to reveal a startled 15 year old boy. "You guys?!" He called in a voice cracked by puberty. Norman could just make out several others run off in the opposite direction. 

"This is not safe what you're doing here young man, and very inconsiderate I think. You could have given folks quite a scare. You wouldn't want that." The boy just stammered as he searched for a method of escape. "Now then, I would let you off in the trust that you'd learnt a lesson, but with this knife you could have really hurt yourself. I'd better call your parents." The boy struggled and stuttered "I... I don't have parents." "Well," Norman said "Then I better call child protective services." He said, flipping open his phone. 

35 minutes later a very petite woman with greying hair came to apologize to Norman for her son Robby and his friends. 

The next day, Norman was on the cover of the local paper. "Tourist Norman Orman apprehends clown prankster terrorizing pre-school".

"Clowns." Norman thought "Maybe that's what I'll be for Halloween?"

</thread><thread title=[Norman Cooks Out] author=[JapaneseSteakhouse] text=[https://www.reddit.com/r/darknorman/comments/5wsfvo/norman_co/ 
Norman arose, on Saturday morning, to the sounds of birds chirping. He knew it was going to be a good day. Norman had a big day planned. He and his roommate, Carl, had been going through a rough patch. A couple of days back, Carl had mistakenly used the last of the cream for his morning coffee, and that had NOT gone over well. Norman and Carl had a bitter fight that morning, and the two had not been speaking to each other since.

Admittedly, it had been a stressful situation for the both of them. Norman cherished their friendship, so, today, he was going to go out and pick up a couple of steaks, and some beers-Carl was a Rolling Rock man-and cook a big dinner, so as to mend the friendship.

Norman, tentatively, walked into the kitchen to grab his keys, and a cup of coffee before he left. Carl was sitting at the table, silently, just staring at his serial. "Well, I'm heading out man" Norman said. Carl stewed. Norman figured brevity was best, so he was off. "I'll catch you later tonight man. I've got dinner under control-I still feel bad about the other day!" And before he could catch Carl's response, he slammed the door and was off.

Later that night, as Norman was pulling the steaks off the grill, he called to Carl, "Hey man! Ready for dinner?!? Grab us a couple of 'Rocks, will ya?" Norman and Carl had always referred to Rolling Rocks as "Rocks", because of those two girls...Those were the days!

As Norman walked into the kitchen, he was a little miffed, but not surprised. "That's just Carl!" he mused... Carl hadn't gotten their beers out, nor had he put up his cereal bowl. Norman walked over to the table and picked up the bowl of moldy cereal as a fly flew away from the bowl. "Carl man, what have you been doing? Don't eat this kind of crap! It will make you sick!" Norman busied himself while he set the plates. Then, it was time for dinner. Carl had slouched over, and that simply wouldn't do. "Carl man!" Norman declared, as he wrapped his hand around the butcher knife that he had plunged into Carl's back, several days earlier, and lifted him up so he could set his plate down, "You can't eat your food if your face down on the table man!" Norman then set his plate down, and pulled his chair up to the table. As he went to cut into his Ribeye, Norman stopped and looked at Carl, grinning..."Almost forgot the Rocks!" Norman said, as he dashed to the fridge, "Can't forget the Rocks!"] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5wwx5v/norman_cooks_out/] createDate=[1488414167] score=[0] numComments=[2]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Gets a new Pet... And breaks some stuff.] author=[[deleted]] text=[When Norman woke up, he decided that his life was more boring than usual. His cat, Norman, had just died, and Norman was lonely. After working his average day-job in the cubicle on the 5th floor of the Bank of America building, received his salary for the week, Norman wanted to get a new pet. Consulting Google Maps, Norman discovered a lovely little pet shop, called Normandy Pets. Norman decided to begin his search for a new pet there. When Norman arrived, he was greeted with all sorts of pets: Birds, cats, dogs, lizards, amphibians, and fish. Norman finally settles on a new cat. The cat is a sleek calico, with black and white splotches all over. He decided to name it Norman. Norman likes Norman. (Norman-ception). Both Normans arrived home, and when Norman took Norman (the cat) out of his little box, he ran all around his bleak little house. The cat was quickly bored; and seeing this, Norman left to get him some toys. However, since Norman is a cat, and cats ALWAYS get bored, the cat sprinted full speed around the house for fun. In doing so, he knocked over Norman's most precious possession: His 72-inch flatscreen TV. When Norman returned with the toys, he saw Norman the cat sitting on top of his shattered TV, looking completely innocent. Norman sighed and put his head into his hands; He was going to have to work double-time to buy back a TV. Norman decided that getting a new cat without being trained was a bad idea, and quickly enrolled Norman into a cat training class.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4druk4/norman_gets_a_new_pet_and_breaks_some_stuff/] createDate=[1460075538] score=[0] numComments=[0]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman invites his Son to Christmas dinner.] author=[S-BRO] text=[Norman, the cat had been particularly mischevious today, knocking things from their perches, pulling cables from their sockets.
Even attempting to steal a bite from the plump turkey Norman, the man, was trying to cook to impress his son.

Norman had not heard from his son all day but still clung to the hope he would not let him down, not on Christmas surely?
He had of course confirmed earlier in the week he and his new fiance would be delighted to join Norman for Christmas, even so he had not gotten in touch today and it was getting late.

The worry started to set into Norman's mind.

The anger at being let down once again.

Then the crippling loneliness, oh how Norman knew the loneliness the most.

"No more" Norman told his cat, Norman.

"I won't feel like this No more" he said, stepping up onto the chair.

Norman had picked out his favourite tie for this, he fingered it softly with a sad smile on his lips, his son had bought this for him when he had moved out, it was a good tie.

With a sigh Norman kicked away the chair, a single tear rolling down his face as he struggled slightly.

Norman the cat ran for cover at the sound of the chair falling, seeking refuge below the telephone table, there was a small click only Norman the cat heard.

"Hey Dad, traffic is awful so we're running a bit late, I can't seem to reach your phone, you really must get a mobile phone soon!

</thread><thread title=[Norman ascends to the gates of heaven] author=[alexthes0ck] text=[Norman is heading home from work. Another rough day at the plant, he is happy to finally return to his humble abode. While laying down for a good night's sleep, Norman's heart goes out, killing him while he sleeps. 


Norman wakes up as his spiritual form ascends from the plane of existence and into the afterlife. He is greeted by Jesus who is holding out the gates of heaven for Norman. Norman, being a good man his entire life, has never committed one sin and has been granted eternal paradise for his holy patience.


Norman speaks to Jesus "Sorry sir where am I", Jesus responds  "You are in heaven my child and for your lifelong devotion to remaining pure and good you have been rewarded the gift of eternal pleasure."


Norman looks at the gates and the large set of marble stairs. He looks at Jesus and the cloud they are both standing on. "Oh I cant do that, I gotta go to work tomorrow.". Jesus, confused looks at Norman. "But, my child... You dont understand, you have passed from this world into the other. You have been liberated and absolved. You are free to do anything and have anything you want forever! Do you not want Elysium?"


"Sorry but I just want to go to work tomorrow. How do you get down from this thing?". Jesus is outraged "I DONT UNDERSTAND. I HAVE OFFERED YOU AN ETERNAL LIFE FREE OF PAIN AND OF SUFFERING. A LIFE OF BEAUTY AND JOY. AND YOU DENY MY GIFTS ONLY TO RETURN HOME TO LIVE  ANOTHER 12 YEARS 4 MONTHS AND 22 DAYS A SLAVE? DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS OF WHAT I AM OFFERING YOU?"


"No Sir I do. But if Im up here, who will feed Norman, my cat? Who's gonna make Casserole every Wednesday?"


Jesus was dumbfounded. He was at a loss for words. Everyone he has ever seen come to heaven was absolutely ecstatic that their faith was rewarded. Jesus thought to himself for a bit and finally faced Norman. "Alright my son, if paradise for you is going to work, feeding your cat who is also aptly named Norman and making Casserolle on wednesday then who am I to rob you of that. I shall return you to your earthly form. But my offer will still stand when you eventually pass again, assuming you continue this life without sin."


"Thank you sir, that is all I want." Norman said with a smile. Jesus snaps his fingers and Norman falls back into his body. He wakes up and looks around, sees his cat Norman laying on the floor, his work uniform hung up on his door and his calendar with each Wednesday circled in red ink.


"This is all I want, all.... I .... want." Norman falls back to sleep with a grin, ready to wake up at 6 AM tomorrow to get to the plant on time.

</thread><thread title=[Norman goes to the library] author=[ferrum23] text=[Norman never visited the library. However, his wife had made him join one, so he had been keeping obediently his little membership card in his wallet ever since.

One day, as he was organizing his wallet, he discovered that the card would expire in a week. He stood dumbfounded after realizing how much it would change his life if there was a new empty space in his wallet. No such ridiculous thing had happened to him in his entire life including his divorce with his wife to whom he never felt anything passionate anyways.

Thinking over this, he decided he would make an appointment with the library to settle things down, and so that his ordinary life could continue.

A few days later, on the day when he had to go to the library, he felt completely different from usual. It was an ugly October day, it was overcast and chilly, but Norman felt thrilled, maybe for the first time in his miserable life. He felt he could do anything he wanted. He skipped brushing his teeth that morning, and went in the same underwear to work that the day before that, aswell. During work he could barely concentrate, which made his few colleagues who realized he existed wonder whether he was okay.

However, he never got to the library that day. Upon leaving his workplace, he made a mistake that he would never have made had he been his usual self. But he felt special that day, like the whole world or God was watching him. It was a terrible mistake though, a fatal one.

So when he left his workplace, he felt confident enough that he took a taxi from his little spare money he had been hiding even from his cat, who obviously didn't know why he deserved this kind of treatment from his owner, but he was okay with that because he never knew why his owner did things, anyways.

Next day, there was a little article on the last page of the local newspaper that reported that two white male in their forties died in a car accident after the taxi driver reportedly lost control of his cab and crashed into a pose on the main road yesterday afternoon.

This unfortunate, yet forgettable accident could have been avoided, had Norman chosen his main means of transport, the public transport.

</thread><thread title=[Norman meets...] author=[mako-jaeger] text=[Norman was having his coffee when he heard a scratching at the door. Instinctively, he knew it was his cat, and looking outside and seeing it was a sunny day, decided it would be pleasant to take a walk. He grabbed Norman's leash and attached it to his collar, and opened the door to the sweet spring breeze, walking out onto the sidewalk.

After a while of walking, Norman noticed someone coming up his way on a skateboard, and cautiously took himself and Norman into the grass. It was then he realized the boy riding the skateboard was not so much riding it as he was fumbling on and off of it.

When the boy reached him, the boy let out and audible huff of frustration and stopped riding. "Hey man," he said. "Do you know where the museum is?"

"Museum. There is no museum in our town."

"What, yeah there is," the boy said. He fiddled around in his pocket and pulled out his wallet. "I have a card I use whenever I want to get a book."

Norman was baffled, was this some joke. With a nervous laugh, he said, "Do you mean a library?"

"That's what that's called? I figured it was the name of the Musuem."

"Yes," Norman said, struggling to come to terms with what he was hearing. This boy looked to be a freshmen in highschool, how could he not have heard of a library or what one was? "Well the library is down this road and then you take the first left." He paused, did the boy even know what left was. He decided to point so as to not confuse him. "And then it is the third building on the right."

"Alright, thanks man," the boy said.

"What was your name."

The boy was again fumbling away on his skateboard, but looked back and said, "Kevin, cool dog by the way."] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4cqytu/norman_meets/] createDate=[1459472948] score=[0] numComments=[5]>

</thread><thread title=[Norman ditches work on Tuesday.] author=[indeft] text=[Tuesday. 

The morning light glared in like burning rays from a giant magnifying glass. The stale air lingered in the small bedroom. A miasma hung overhead as it does with recently dead corpses. Particularly the ones who’ve had terrible diets like reheated fast food and diet-rite cola. The dirty bed sheets laid strewn across him and disheveled. He hadn’t slept again. His eyes slowly peeled open.

He laid there awake, again, as he had done many times before. Staring into nothing. Contemplating the events of his life, then slowly pulling the bed sheets up and back over his head. As he closed his eyes again, his telephone rang.

“…Norman, your late again!...” a voice squawked. 

Norman’s life predicament resonated in the fact that he was not simply a normal man. He was 43 years old, divorced, and estranged from his family completely. Through unfortunate circumstances, he couldn’t force himself to maintain relationships anymore. Be this what it may, it is not the reason why he was different, however. Apart from his penchant for insecurity and self-sabotage, Norman discovered an ability that was quite unique. So unique it that is was unlike anything at all.

“…I’m sick…” Norman slowly turned out the words as he hung up and tossed the phone aside.

The phone abruptly rang again. 

With a swift movement he lurched across the bed toward the phone, and heaved it as hard as he could toward the wall. The impact was a deep thud and then a series of crashing sounds. Like a muffled gunshot generating sonic tidal waves. The phone came apart systematically. First, the case split apart. Then the cracks across the screen slowly became interwoven like a spider's web. The drywall sunk in. It suddenly stopped. 

The device was no longer, and laid across the room in pieces. He stared intently at the damage he’d done.

“I can’t be…*this*…anymore” Norman thought. 

His body, exhausted, slowly laid back down and reached for the covers.

<comment number=[1]author=[ILIKEFUUD]text=[I can sort of appreciate the fact that you wanted to do something different with Norman, but this piece isn't particularly in line with the others that do creative things. This goes against the grain while the others turn the grain into oatmeal. 

It certainly doesn't fit the tone of the writing here too, most statements should start with "Norman" to keep the feel of the subreddit. This is very out of character of Norman, and although in a real story book this would be exciting or inciting, here it falls flat. You gotta write for the audience! We come here for Norman stories, not Noir stories. Out of character is fine, as long as it's out of character while still maintaining the "feel" of a Norman story.

"Should I add some salt?" He wonders. "Probably not."

After lunch, he returns to Reddit. Trying to sign in again, he accidentally inputs his screen name into Reddit's search function. 

/r/LifeofNorman appears in the search results. 

Norman stares at it for a few seconds, wondering what it could mean. His hands cringe away from the keyboard. He looks over at the empty bowl of soup, then returns his eyes to the screen. Slowly, the shameful horror of his own being rattles him, trying to enter consciousness completely. 

"Maybe there was something wrong with that soup," Norman says.

He sweats. Questions Norman had avoided since childhood ravage his unconscious mind, threatening to breach awareness and push him off sanity's edge.    

"I better go to the bathroom," Norman says as he shuts off his computer, stands up, and starts loosening his belt as he walks to his second favorite room.

Norman purrs and follows him.

https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4vu032/norman_threatens_his_coworkers_with_a_bomb/

The only common threads I'm seeing are Norman living a dull existence, snapping, and doing something crazy. Maybe you want to explore depression or monotony in Norman's life, feel free to do so, but not like this. If Norman were to do something spontaneous it'd be on a much smaller scale; he's not used to change, and it wouldn't be so negative, bomb threats is completely uncharacteristic of him, he's a good man with good intentions. I remember one story some kids wanted him to help get a kite down from a tree but he pretended he didn't hear them and walked on, maybe because of anxiety or fear of failure or something. That was a negative action but it felt realistic and one could see why he did what he did. The same can't be said for your stories. Also, you seem to be fixed on killing Norman's cat in your stories. Any reason why? Anyway, I'll let the story stay up, we're not dictators, but please change your plotlines to be more realistic or do take it to other subreddits others might mention that might suit your stories more.]score=[16] </comment>

<comment number=[4]author=[alexbolster2]text=[My sub is not political. It's a parody of donald trumps life. Any political arguments will be removed. I'm sorry there aren't more stories. I'm trying to get the sub going and need creative people. I'm a big fan of the writing of my fellow Norman lovers.]score=[0] </comment>

<comment number=[6]author=[alexbolster2]text=[This is the antithesis of /r/lifeofnorman i have always wanted to make this sub ever since i fell in love with /r/lifeofnorman. 
Here's the concept: this sub is not a hateful place, but it is made to make fun of a orangutan-man. It's a place to write stories about a person who is undeniably relate-able. We all have a bit of Donald in us, so make sure to treat others the way you would want to be treated, as well as writing stories that have Donald's narscism, hubiristic, and rash character simply as the butt of the joke. Hillary Clinton stories are welcomed. ]score=[-2] </comment>

</thread><thread title=[Norman feels unfamiliar emotions] author=[[deleted]] text=[Norman’s face flushed with anger.  This was an emotion he was normally unfamiliar with, but now it was coming on strong and it was making him very uncomfortable but you know what  ****! rich people.  Life is not fair he stared with jealousy at the bright red sports car with the horse rearing up, taunting him.  661 horsepower with a turbo charged v8 and there hanging from the mirror… oh he couldn’t look anymore.  The life of the rich and the very middle class was all too different.  A young couple jumped into the car and roared off and the cat toy swung on the mirror.  Oh how he envied them, all that money to throw around, boy he wished he could afford to splurge on a cat toy to hang from his mirror, but that would be financially irresponsible.  He looked down at Norman lazily licking his paws and his anger evaporated.  There were more important things in life.  He gathered his new box set collector’s edition of CSI and began his walk home. ] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4robzg/norman_feels_unfamiliar_emotions/] createDate=[1467923906] score=[0] numComments=[4]>

<comment number=[4]author=[[deleted]]text=[Yeah, it wasn't the best. The idea was to make the reader think he was jealous of the sports car and then realize he was jealous of the cat toy hanging from the mirror. Yeah, I like a lot of the other stories.

</thread><thread title=[Norman Works a Second Job] author=[saleemkarim] text=[Norman's first pizza delivery was to a hotel room. Norman entered the hotel in his purple uniform, holding a large extra cheese in his bag. There was a young blond women at the front counter.


"I'm here to deliver a pizza," Norman said.


"Sure, have at it, bud."


Norman, smiled all the way to the elevator. He pushed the button. While waiting, he considered telling the young woman that this was only a temporary job, and that if she were his mother, she would not be disappointed in him.


The elevator doors opened. Norman stepped in. Just as he pushed the 8th floor button, he saw an old man in the far off distance running toward the elevator. The old man wore overalls and a trucker hat, which frightened Norman.


The old man yelled, "Hold the elevator! Hold the elevator!"


Norman couldn't summon the courage to hold the elevator. "I'm Sorry!" Norman said. "I'm running out of time on this delivery!" The doors began to close.


The old man tripped. He fell through a glass table. He screamed, "It's my delivery! You fuckin' idiot!"


Norman felt as though his testicles were in his chest, and that they exploded. The doors were almost shut. Norman jerked his hand forward to stop them, but he was too late. His middle finger crunched as it broke backwards on the metal door.


Norman punched the stop button to keep the doors shut. He balled into a corner, and cried into his shaking fists. All that mattered to him was staying in this womb, but he knew he'd be pulled out.


Norman slid off the pizza bag, then opened the box. He smeared the searing hot cheese and pizza sauce all over his chest and face.


The next day, everything was alright for Norman. He would be staying inside for a long, long time.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/60iqio/norman_works_a_second_job/] createDate=[1490067887] score=[0] numComments=[5]>

It's fairly well written, and is punctuated well, however the story is just god awful. ]score=[4] </comment>

<comment number=[5]author=[SpiderTechnitian]text=[Doesn't fit his psych profile to break like this. He's just a normal dude. I don't think there is even a reason for him to do another job, his office job will sustain him forever. And delivering pizzas of all things? I mean that's way too adventurous for him. 

Norman is average and boring, that's the whole point. This is anything but]score=[2] </comment>

</thread><thread title=[Norman Threatens His Coworkers with a Bomb] author=[Capt_Misinformation] text=[Norman was tired of his meaningless life.  One day at work, while his co-worker stole credit for work Norman did, Norman snapped.  He began yelling that he had hidden a bomb in the building and that he had a remote to set it off in his pocket.  Norman told everyone to give him their wallets or he would press the remote.  One man decided to be a hero, tackled Norman to the ground, and restrained him until the police could take him away.  

It turns out that Norman was just mentally unstable and that he made the whole bomb threat up.  Unfortunately, Norman was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Also, Norman didn't have any friends or money for bail and his cat, Norman, starved to death.] url=[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4vu032/norman_threatens_his_coworkers_with_a_bomb/] createDate=[1470191560] score=[0] numComments=[7]>
